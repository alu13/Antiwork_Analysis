3,Escape routes for the terminally impoverished?,"So I've been trying, for the last few years, to save up a modest bit of savings that would allow me to travel for one year, to try and find some other way of existing in the world than wage slavery.

I've been working my ass off, on a good wage and trying my hardest to save. My goal was 10 years of saving and then escape for a simpler life. However, in order to find a job I had to move to one of the most expensive cities in the world and have barely been able to save £1K this year. I cannot do this for another 10 years, and even if I could, one large expense could wipe out any savings I've made. A couple of years ago I'd hit £7K, then I lost my job and the whole lot was gone in the 6 months it took me to find a new one. 

They just 'extended my probation' at work and I'm so done. They want me to fight for my job, but I don't even want it. So I've tried to do this the responsible way, I've tried to be an adult, to work hard and save, but that's clearly not going to be an option for me. 

So what are my other options? The nomad van life is out of the question as I don't have the funds for driving lessons or a vehicle. Go live on a commune or intentional community (I've looked into it - a lot of them want you to buy your way in with a land or property purchase), an ashram, a kibbutz? 

Send me your suggestions, no matter how wild! 

(But please remember that lots of ways to 'live free' actually have quite a high start up cost. I'm likely to be homeless and jobless in Jan with approx £2.5K available)",False,e1htxf,rwilkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e1htxf/escape_routes_for_the_terminally_impoverished/,12,1

It's also extremely selfish to hold onto paid employment that you don't need that someone else desperately does. Even if you wanted routine or some other crap are you so reliant on your job to give you that? Why can't you create that for yourself with volunteering or a self study schedule?

There are so many things I could think to do with my time that I honestly cannot believe people who say that: I would practice piano playing, learn French and Spanish, play all the video games I'd missed, read a ton of books, travel all over the world, start a home business, learn how to sew, take up a degree in philosophy, volunteer teaching kids to code, mentor children from backgrounds like myself, spend more time with my grandmother who is really old, go back to writing stories and poems like I did as a teenager, the list goes on and on and on...",False,e1pdgq,johnyj3tream,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e1pdgq/people_who_say_they_would_continue_working_if/,13,1

The Vast Majority of Us Only Work for This Reason.","Although we've been to space, created the internet, harvested atomic power, most of us have to live in constant fear that  falling sick for just one day could make you lose everything. We have created a machine that does not care about human happiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

We need to radically change the way we live. We can't just always live for the tomorrow that isn't even promised to us. When the very top percent of people make more money when they sleep then I'll make in a lifetime things have gone WAY too far.

We need to create a society that is made for humans, not for profit, not for control, but to be free. I feel there should definitely be a line drawn however between hedonism and really living.

21,My boss gaslit me tonight :),"Since it was the day before thanksgiving we were packed, and even with three cashiers we had a rush that was over an hour. When it finally stopped I took a minute to see how empty the front end was, and then went about emptying the garbage, as I had been told it's part of my job, and have been doing it since I started last week. 

While doing the garbage, my co worker was looking at the list of things to do she'd been given, and mentioned that it was weird they gave us to do lists. She saw that they wanted her to sweep, and she said 'okay cool, don't know how I'm supposed to do that when I have to use a cane' and I responded, jokingly with 'what, you don't know how to grow a third arm? How dare you!"" she replied half jokingly that she's not going to be able to work under those kinds of conditions. 

The next thing I know my store manager is pulling me and another cashier into the office and is literally SCREAMING at us that we haven't been doing our jobs and he's tired of it. He singled me out repeatedly and even let the other employee go to yell at me more, saying since I've started working I haven't been doing my job. 

Aside from tonight and my interview I've literally only fucking seen this guy, IN PASSING, like three other times. He kept insisting that he's been constantly telling me to do things, and that I haven't done them. He got mad because I did the garbage, asking why I did it, when 'no one told you to do that, but you have time to stand around up here complaining about what you're being paid!'

No one said anything about what we were being paid. Which, even if we fucking did mention salary, the fucking company code of conducts specifies we're allowed to discuss not only that, but also working conditions. 

He also ended up sending everyone else home at their scheduled time to leave, and forced me to stay an extra half hour doing restocking because 'it hasn't been done, so no one gets to leave until it is'. 

I kept trying to mention that he literally has not told me except for one time to do restocking, and the reason I ended up back at my register and not getting it done is because I was called back by the other manager, and he kept while not outright calling me a liar, implying that I was lying. 

I ended up upset the rest of my shift and I'm fucking pissed but I don't know what to do. No one told me doing fucking restock is apparently more important than fucking cashiering, which is what I got hired to do. This fucking guy literally told me to ignore lines of customers to do restock? And berated me that I should 'know that' because I've worked retail before? If I fucking walked away from 'three or four' people in a line to do something else at my old jobs I would have been written up for it.

But I'm also terrible at focusing due to ADHD, which everybody I tell assures me isn't real, despite the destructive impact it's had on my life. Also, due to not living in a civilized country, I can't afford health insurance, so I have to rely on Medicaid. The income limit for receiving Medicaid is absurdly little, look it up.

THEN I asked my direct manager that actually runs things day to day in my dept the same thing just to be sure we really could, and he said yes as well.

42,Forced to be in work group chat? And other grievances.,"Idk where else to post this but it's mostly just me complaining. 

I work for a shitty fast food restaurant in Texas and my boss/upper management has forced me to download an app that the entire team uses. We're expected to have the app and read and respond to messages at all times of the day unless you're actually on the clock because we're not allowed to use our phones when at work.  I check the app as little as possible because I hate the idea of doing anything work related if I'm not being paid for it and I've gotten verbally reprimanded by my boss for not responding in the chats. 

And then there's the fact that I've been yelled at / forced to not go to the bathroom when I've been working and also clocked out for the five minutes I was in the restroom.  I'm female and I'm also yelled at for bringing even just a little makeup bag into the bathroom for when I'm on my period and don't want my coworkers/the customers to see me carrying a tampon or whatever. It's embarrassing and I hate going to the restroom at work because of it. Is my boss seriously allowed to do this?

tl;dr: most of this is just complaining but is my boss allowed to make me keep an app on my phone that I pay for that is used to talk about work and threaten to write me up at work for if I don't check it?

My step-dad (we will call him T) came home from work just few minutes ago and was talking about his day and how he had a new employee (we will call him H). 

T is a co-owner of his family business a plumbing and electrical service shop start by his grandfather before him; currently, his dad is the 'CEO', but he is second in command. 

Regardless, T is talking about H. H is 19 and new to the business. T describes H as nerdy and tells us he really enjoys Harry Potter. T said, ""I think I beat the wizards out of Harry Potter today."" Then, my mother is vocal against his business practices and employee treatment says, ""yeah, he came in with a soul, but now you've taken it from him."" Without hesitation, T chuckles and says, ""yeah, that's what you have to do in order to truly work hard."" 

After this, I immediately I thought of this sub and thought I should share. Its ridiculous that society has fooled the general populace into believing if you have a soul then you arent a hard worker.

Anyway, I stopped working in a salon/shop and just kept my clientele and made house calls. I still do this and I have a room where I have a sink and can comfortably do chemical/color work.

I enjoy being my own boss and not paying all my earned money to my boss in booth rent.

I do hair on my own now and sell stuff online, doing so I make enough money to get by and live comfortably.

Thanksgiving dinner he came over and looked me dead in the eye in the middle of nowhere and said ""I'm disappointed in you. You went through college just to piss it all away.""

I said ""I don't see how I pissed it away, last week I made over $120 alone doing hair and I made enough money reselling online to afford to pay for and cook this meal"" we aren't on food stamps, I paid for our entire dinner with my own money.

He said he makes his way in life honestly. He works for a trucking company, doesn't get any sleep, had to re-home dogs because he was never at home and couldn't afford sitters, missed his oldest daughters high school graduation because he was in another state on the road, has been told by his doctor that if he doesn't slow down and take it easy he can have a stroke, has had to give up his hobby of racing because he's never off on Saturday and hasn't been in years, this is the first Thanksgiving he's been off since I can remember and I don't recall him ever being around for Christmas. My aunt hates how he's always working, but she says ""at least we don't have to worry about starving.""

He's disappointed because I'm not slaving away somewhere else. He claims I don't have a real way of living because I work from home and don't have an hourly schedule. Some weeks I don't do anything hair related but I sell a lot online and some weeks I feel overworked doing hair and I don't have any sales, and sometimes it's sadly dead on both ends.

I hate being judged and told I pissed away my education. 

And he didn't once say he was thankful for being home for the holidays.",False,e3pd9q,lagatoazul,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e3pd9q/my_uncle_is_disappointed_in_me_for_not_working/,30,1
50,Rant about working in hostile London,"I've been working in a high-pressure environment in London for the past 2.5 yr since graduation. Some things I really hate about the UK system are: 

\-Unpaid overtime (seriously, I have lost count of the amount of times I worked hours extra to cope with deadlines)

\-Having to finish someone else's work despite having finished mine; he will then go home early and I am forced to stay and finish someone else's work because sr manager says so

\-London is full of materialistic people 

\-Drug use drives me crazy; these employees now have more energy to cope with high demands making you look ""lazy""

\-Extremely poor worker's rights (you can in fact, lose your job if you become pregnant, no rights until you've worked with them 2 years, also if something bad happens like unfair dismissal, even if you were to win the case the next employers won't touch you and you may be unemployed forever)

\-Directors/higher people have a habit of screaming at employees (not always, but in 50% of places they do)

\-Backstabbing colleagues (esp as a woman working with other women)

\-Lack of appreciation towards your work as the city has such a large talent pool they can get someone new anytime

\-Obsession with process improvements (like, there is only so much you can ""improve"" without risking making your own role obsolete)

\-Obsession with after work drinks and failure to attend will make you look antisocial. for me, ever if I like my team, I have no interest in alcohol, I want to go home and recover or walk in a park 

\-Extremely few annual holiday and sick days (this isn't Norway)

\-Extremely poor/low salaries compared to cost of living. And this is even for highly-skilled people. Unless you're a director getting £100k, you may struggle. Most beginners get between £20k-24£. Pathetic.

\-No tolerance for employees being late, even though we have some of the worst trains I've ever seen, frequently late/cancelled, overprices and dirty

\-No willingness to let people work from home",False,e3u08s,paperflowers55,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e3u08s/rant_about_working_in_hostile_london/,13,1

My theory is, as time goes, the elites will find themselves unable to let their slave stock live in dignity, which will lead to the tragic death of millions of wage slaves all around the globe. When the further stages of collapse show, the survival of the fittest would only have selected the most wealthy, and it will turn into a new war of classes, between, say, billionaires, multi-millionaires, and millionaires. Each time someone needs to serve someone, or to be served, mankind decays.

Especially egregious given that I did 2 months of weekly work experience which consisted almost entirely of being on my feet and retrieving files from shelves and the phone of the male interviewer went off and he didn’t apologise.

I have another interview for the same position and  while I was somewhat positive, I am now dreading it.

77,New job advice - an employers dick move that I'm not happy about,"Not sure if this fits in with the sub but it seems like the best place I could find. I started a new job this week that I actually love; good pay, good team, perfect location from where I live, the boss is a character and seem to care about his employees. I couldn't see any problems. That was until yesterday, my second day, the boss drops on me that we're moving office. Not in a few weeks or months but THIS week. Tomorrow in fact, which will only be my fourth day. Now the problem with this move is I wasn't told about it when they offered me the job or even in the interview process. There was mention of an eventual move but I can guarantee they haven't organised this within a week. The 2 concerns I now have are:

1. The new office is further north from the current location which means it's also further north from where I live. I've estimated it's going to add hour to my daily commute (I use public transport) to get to and from the office, essentially an hour that I won't have for rest or relaxation. Doesn't seem fair to me.
2. The other thing I'm worried about is if they've kept this from me then what else have I not been told. Is there another piece from crucial news going to come out next week or next month or next year? How can I trust these people when my employment has started on a lie?

Personally I think these are both very valid complaints. I will say that the location was one of the things that attracted me to the job and if I knew about this move &amp; where they're going then I wouldn't have even applied for the job in the first place let alone accepted the offer. I've told a few people close to me about this and also mentioned that I'm going to bring this up tomorrow with the boss. Almost everyone has agreed it was a dick move but also said to be careful as I could lose the job with nothing to fall back on. So be it if I lose the job, as I've had a lot of other companies call me sine I started about other jobs I've recently applied for, and I feel if I don't speak up now while it's still early then I'd be pulling a dick move to them when I say after a month that I'm not happy about this. I'd love some impartial advice because I'm really not happy about being lied to or taken advantage of. Has anyone else experienced something similar, and if so, how did you handle it? Are there other things I should consider before speaking up? Thanks to anyone in advance who sees this and offers advice.

TL;DR: Started a new job this week and the boss told me after I started that we're moving to an office which is further away from my place THIS week. I feel he should've told me this before offering the job and I want to talk to him about this tomorrow but want some advice first.",False,e2ddxx,pakistanstar,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e2ddxx/new_job_advice_an_employers_dick_move_that_im_not/,16,1

83,There is no way to win in employment as long as competition is accepted as the norm.,"I've been reading *22 Immutable Laws of Marketing* and *Zero to One* and decided to apply what I learned to work culture. Here is why it is impossible to win being an employee. 

*The law of competition*

When entering a competitive market, such as an industry or a certain field, one must automatically adjust to the rules. This means taking on the same rate and expectations. However, to achieve excellence in that field one must offer exceptional value which means higher returns at a lower cost. When labor is evaluated on hourly basis, the person who does it then becomes a commodity. Thus the competition doesn’t become over what the person can do but rather over the person themselves. Squeezed for resources until they cannot give anymore, they are discarded for not being able to handle a high stress environment. This revolving wheel of exploitation leads to lower rates, higher expectations, and higher profits to those who hire hourly labor to create a product that brings them value. When workers are forced to compete between themselves, only the owners benefit.  

*The law of leadership* 

The opposite of competition, is leadership. Being a leader in a certain market segment allows one to charge a premium rate until competition catches up. In employment, carving out a new niche is the best way to increase earnings. The challenges here are originally and charisma. One not only must invent a new market segment but drive a demand to it. In essence, a new specialist is an entrepreneur.  

The reason why it’s so difficult to win in employment is not due to the lack of education or skills, not enough jobs, or terrible bosses, but due to harsh competition between employees themselves. Breaking away from the norm rather than striving for excellence is the only way out of the downward spiral. ",False,e2pwmd,tothet92,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e2pwmd/there_is_no_way_to_win_in_employment_as_long_as/,8,1

98,A sad reminder about employee provided healthcare,"I just got a letter in the mail from my job (amazon) saying I'm not eligible for medical benefits because I don't meet the average hours minimum (well duh I'm part time). Lucky for me the 401k and stock program are open to all employees. 

The sad part is that I could never take advantage of the so called insurance anyways because I was seasonal for nearly the whole year I've been there, and once I become part time permanent I still couldn't use the insurance because you had to go to a place that will take your insurance provider, in my case someplace way across town that I could never get to. That and I believe you still would have to pay some fees to see whatever doctor. And I never even scratch over 20 hours, let alone the 30 minimum they're saying you need to qualify.

I already lack a vehicle or even my own room, so I have no way to just ride around to get to some special doctor. That and I still wouldn't be able to go see a doctor for my real issue being my varicoceles. I went to the emergency room about a year ago now for testicle pain that I had been having for weeks beforehand. I got an ultrasound on my nuts and they found out I had a tiny cyst down there and a varicocele. So basically I can be walking around infertile and not even know it. But to be fair I can't even eat a meal alone in peace so I guess I'm not supposed to be worried about that.

99,There are too many dirty old men in the office and I’m a 26 year old woman,"Sorry, I just need to vent. I’m 26, I’m a woman, and I work as a secretary at a material handling company. I bring pepper spray to work. Every day. The guys I deal with (2 of them) like younger women, and it’s freaking me out. One morning I went back into the shop solely for information about a customer order and found the shop tech listening to a song called “Wet Dreams.” He said it was about fishing, and they play it on the radio on rainy days, but still I left that interaction feeling really uneasy. 

I want to tell my boss so that I’m not just burying my head in the sand over it. I’m just not sure what to say. I have this horrible feeling that this particular tech is only nice to me because I’m a young woman. I know it’s not okay; it’s wildly inappropriate to bring sexual language like that into the workplace, even if you insist it’s about fishing. Everyone else in the office avoids him, and one person even said to me, “he loves your age group.” But, depending on my job needs, I will need to go back there and get information from him, which involves being alone with him in a secluded area (think auto shop). I’ve only ever talked about work with him, or the usual small talk. 

I’m not really sure how to handle this, as it hasn’t come up in the workplace before. At my old job it was almost all women, and we had each other’s backs.

102,America was founded by people who hated work.,"I learned from an article entitled [Our Forefather’s Failure](http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_March_2010.pdf) (at [LibertyUnbound.com](http://www.libertyunbound.com/)) that the colonies at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown tried both free-market and communist systems—long before Karl Marx was born. (The Liberty Unbound article appears to have been based on a 1985 Mises Institute article by Richard J. Maybury entitled [The Great Thanksgiving Hoax](https://mises.org/library/great-thanksgiving-hoax-0), and on a 2000 article by Dr. Judd W. Patton entitled [The Pilgrim Story: Vital Lessons And Insights For Today](http://jpatton.bellevue.edu/biblical_economics/pilgrimstory.html).)

The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in December 1620, and in spite of help from the Native Americans, half of them died the first year as a result of their initial system. During the second year, more of them died. They would quickly learn that their initial system was tragically incompatible with human nature. It was simply unnatural.

The colonists had the ideal conditions for their initial system because they all had a reputation as virtuous hard working people, they were all of the same race, religion, politics, and nationality; and of course, they all had agreed to this system voluntarily (although somewhat reluctantly). They also knew that failure meant death.

Nevertheless, under their initial system, they simply weren’t producing and storing enough food, which lead to starvation, disease, and discontent. Their first solution, in their second year, was to institute beatings for those who did not work hard enough, but this had little effect on productivity, and it further increased discontent.

The colonists astutely observed that their system tended to retard productivity while breeding confusion and discontent. We know this because they wrote about it in their journals. Clearly, their initial system was incompatible with human nature.

By the spring of 1623 the Pilgrims feared they would not survive another winter, so in desperation, they adopted a radically different system, and it saved their lives. Productivity increased, and in 1623, they didn't have just another harvest feast. That would have to be when they had the first real Thanksgiving.

Which system failed the colonists initially, and which radically different system saved them? Which system was so incompatible with human nature, and which system was so compatible with human nature? Which system was so ugly, and which system was so beautiful?

In order to escape persecution and establish the Plymouth colony in America, the Puritan Separatists (who would later be known as ""Pilgrims"") made a somewhat reluctant agreement with their investors, the Virginia Company of London and the Virginia company of Plymouth (a.k.a. The Adventurers). In this contract (not the Mayflower Compact), they agreed to share everything produced by any one of them—from each according to his ability—to each according to his need, and then after 7 years, they would divide the common accumulated wealth and property with the Adventurers. According to Dr. Judd Patton's article based on the 1647 book by Governor Bradford:

&gt;The contract between the Adventurers and the Pilgrims consisted of ten points. The most critical of which stated, “That all such persons as are of this colony are to have their meat, drink, apparel, and all provisions out of the common stock and goods of the said colony.” Further, it was agreed that during the first seven years. “all profits and benefits that are got by trade, traffic, trucking, working, fishing, or any other means of any persons, remain still in the common stock until the division.”

The result was that only a small percentage of them worked hard, and the rest were freeloaders to varying degrees because they would rather risk death than be exploited by others. They were so reluctant to work that they even left food rotting on the vine! The result was indeed death. Half of them died! This reminds me of the saying by the people of the USSR, “They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work.”

Then, in the spring of 1623, the surviving colonists decided to let each person keep the fruits of his labor, and the colony’s total output increased so much that they were never hungry again.

The governor wrote in his journal that under their initial (communist) system, some of them claimed to be too weak or sick to work, and they were so convincing that it would have been the height of tyranny to force them work. Then, after they learned they could keep the fruits of their labor, those who were too sick to walk suddenly recovered and began working the fields!

Communism was killing the colonists at Plymouth Rock, and by switching to a free-market system, they became more productive and saved themselves—in a single growing season.

The transition from communism to free markets still lacked full property rights however. Whereas each individual owned the fruits of his labor, he did not own the land he worked, and thus he did not own any improvements he made to that land.

In 1623, the colonists were still growing food on parcels of land that were reassigned by random lots each year, which they astutely observed was a disincentive for each farmer to make permanent improvements to his parcel of land because in the following year, someone else would inherit the fruits of any labor he devoted to improvements. Therefore, in 1624, they adopted full property rights where everyone owned the land he worked, and the result was another productivity boost. Whereas, the first step toward property rights and the free market had increased productivity enough to feed everyone, the move to full property rights produced enough extra food to export and trade for furs and other goods.

The article goes on to explain the similar experience in Jamestown:

&gt;Jamestown, the first permanent English colony in America, established in Virginia in 1607, had an experience similar to the Pilgrims at Plymouth. Early years of starvation were followed by converting to a system of property rights and a free market, which brought abundance. Under collectivism, less than half of every shipload of settlers survived the first 12 months at Jamestown. Most of the work was done by only one-fifth of the men, to whom the socialist system gave the same rations as to the others. During the winter of 1609–10, called “The Starving Time,” the population fell from 500 to 60.But when Jamestown converted to a free market, there was “plenty of food, which every man by his own industry may easily and doth procure,” wrote the colony secretary Ralph Hamor in 1614. Under the previous system, he said, “we reaped not so much corn from the labors of thirty men as three men have done for themselves now.”

Ralph Hamor (friend of John Rolfe, whose wife was Pocahontas) also described the failure of communism in Jamestown like this, ""For formerly, when our people were fed out of the common store and labored jointly in the manuring of the ground and planting corn, glad was the man that could slip from his labor. Nay, the most honest of them in a general business would not take so much faithful and true pains in a week as now he will do in a day.""

Governor Bradford of Plymouth further explained the fatal conceit of communism there by saying, “The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato’s and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a common-wealth would make them happy and flourishing; *as if they were wiser than God!""*

None of these articles mentioned the Roanoke colony, whose people simply disappeared, and many speculate that they were killed by the Native Americans, but I think we can all deduce that it is more likely they were killed by communism. Given how they disappeared without any sign of a struggle, an even more likely explanation is that they merged with the Native Americans, but one can easily imagine how such a desperate move may have been precipitated by the failure of communism.

Although both my first hand experience and observations as well as my research and analysis have long since led me to conclude that the free market and property rights are superior to communism, I would have believed that communism could have worked in the case of the first American colonies because they had every advantage one could give communism. They had already unanimously agreed to communism. They all shared the same race, nationality, religion, political views, and economic views. Failure meant starvation, and slackers were beaten, but in spite of every advantage possible, communism was a catastrophic and systemic failure in the first American colonies.

Consider that the colonists at Plymouth Rock had no historical precedent on which to evaluate communism vs. the free market, and yet when communism failed them, they invented and adopted a complete free market system with full property rights in just two years.

In just four years, the colonists proved that that communism was a very unnatural and ugly thing, and that free-markets and property rights were a very natural and beautiful thing.

Our ancestors’ understanding of the superiority of the free market and property rights made us the dominant nation on earth; whereas, today we are rapidly losing that status. Americans have forgotten the hard won knowledge of our ancestors.

Consider that Barack Obama (the US President as of this writing) had 400 years of additional historical precedent as well as a Harvard education, and yet he still doesn’t understand how the free market is superior to communism. Contrary to the [Myth of Obama](http://endofinnocence.com/the-myth-of-obama-busted/), he says, ""[When you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhOTiViSUDU&amp;t=19s)""

Those colonists at Plymouth Rock, who seem so much more in touch with reality than the President of the United States, remind me of small town Americans of my childhood. Of course, the President sees small town Americans as basically racists who have “antipathy toward those who are different” and who “cling to their guns and religion”.

Although, Barack Obama is a dilettante, whose image was [manufactured by the media](http://endofinnocence.com/the-myth-of-obama-busted/), [progressives](http://endofinnocence.com/american-progressive-manifesto-fascism/) have told me that he is right because communism in early America was too soon. They claim that it is not human nature to be a freeloader and that the people themselves have learned a lot since then and would no longer be freeloaders. In case anyone cannot see that the progressive argument is BS, then consider that [the Danish recently proved that 90% still prefer to be freeloaders when they can](http://endofinnocence.com/unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment/)—even when they can make more money working.

One has to ask why [this critical lesson](http://endofinnocence.com/communism-free-markets-plymouth-rock-jamestown/) is not taught to every American (and every human) multiple times per year—even in government schools—*especially* in government schools. Such a thorough conspiracy by the global mainstream to hide the definitive failure of communism made most of the horrors of the 20th century possible, such as the Bolsheviks and related horrors.",False,e2q93r,JimAtEOI,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e2q93r/america_was_founded_by_people_who_hated_work/,19,1

107,A question that popped into my head for the women of antiwork,"So, let me say that I do work, but I work from home and the hours are incredibly flexible and my boss lives in a timezone ten hours ahead of me. If I want to not work at all on any particular day, as long as there is no deadline, I can do that. I used to work in an office and it seemed like my being human would constantly get in the way. For example, I would get sick, tired, have a depressive episode, whathaveyou and would end up missing so much work. I then focused on education that could allow me to work from home which has seemed to solve the problem for the most part, because when i am having a bad day, i can still just rest at home while working away at my computer in bed.   


Now, enough about that. I usually don't have bad periods, but for some reason, this one has completed put me on my ass. I have been getting only a couple hours of sleep at night and have had to sleep during the day. My entire body hurts and my breasts are sore to the point that I have to very delicately put a bra on and my stomach is seriously bloated. It's been like this for three to four days. It wouldn't have been possible for me to go to a traditional job. My question is, women out there who have horrible periods or people who have chronic illness flare ups, how the fuck do you maintain a job - are you miserable the entire time? Like I don't understand how work is so ill-adapted to humans.  For example, my spouse only gets 10 sick days a year. I genuinely don't know one single person who is only sick ten days out of the year.

122,Today I finally figured out why I'm so tired all the time for the past years,"I've been feeling tired all the time for the past years, whenever my mom would call me and ask how things were, I'd reply that I was tired. ""You're tired all the time, you should check that with the doctor"", and so I went.

I tried sleeping pills (benzos and pregabalin), still same problem. Could it be sleep apnea? Doctor didn't think so but still gave me something to open up my airways, didn't work. Could be stress? Maybe! So I took a mindfulness course in which I practice meditation for about 60 minutes every day - been doing it for the past 6 weeks, still tired as fuck. After a work day my mind is completely foggy and during weekends I need to rest to recover from the week and so I don't have time to do anything else.

Today I woke up with a strong hangover and for some reason found this sub, shit! It's work that's been killing me, it was so obvious and it never crossed my mind it could be the cause. The more I browsed the sub, the more I started to despise work, and the more I despised work and the whole system surrounding it, the more I felt guilty. Guilty because I have a seemingly great job that pays way above average, where I can do things that I find pretty cool. The salary may be way above average but the average is way too shitty, which makes my salary just a bit less shitty. No way I can buy a home with this, so I have to live in constant fear that if I ever lose my job, I'll have to live on the streets.

I also realized how much I attached my personality to my job, how much I thought how much self-importance I gave myself based on what I do and my salary, how I compared myself to others based on what I earn and even started to think myself as superior than a scientist friend because I made twice they made - when I've always fucking loved science and think it's one of the most meaninful things a person can do.

I've been fucking brainwashed and was becoming more blind every day and browsing this sub was a refreshing experience, cleaned the fog a little bit, so I went out to the city center and looked at the world like I had a new pair of glasses, while rethinking about life and for some reason I looked at people more empatethically. A friend texted me and for the first time I asked them how they were, and meant it, I genuinelly wanted to know how they were and actually paid attention.

The Empoyer is aware of this and tries to fight it deploying various tools like ""company culture,"" industrial psychology, events organized by HR, useless benefits like table football, employee of the month award and so on.

Raising salary actually doesn't help in the long run at all. Raising salary doesn't solve this contradiction. So if your salary gets raised, you will feel momentary happiness and then it's back to normal.

139,I am moving toward a more free life and I'm both excited and nervous,"Hello,

I feel like writing now, so read this if you're interested:

I've had the idea of anti-work in my head for a while now. I've been extremely anti-capitalist for a long time, and I'm at the point in my life now where I can't take living in the capitalist world anymore. I do not want to work full-time or even part-time, wasting my hours of my weeks for my employers. I mean, I work my ass off full-time for employers and I can barely afford to live. Where am I going in life? I'm 22 and wasting my youth for nothing important. Is there really some point where shit will get better? Fuck no. These past few months I started working full-time again, started renting an apartment again, trying to start a ""normal"" life again. Not because I want to, but because I like the idea of security. It's why I work my life away, I like living in a warm apartment and I like knowing that I'm secure. But even with this barely-security, I still cannot stomach the idea of work anymore. I am trying to play by Capitalism's rules and I'm extremely depressed, crying everyday, barely eating now, barely living. I want out. Working so much is killing my mental health.

I've been thinking about anti-work a lot more recently, and thought about different options. Do I move to the South, where it is cheaper to live? Can I join a commune hundreds of miles from my home state? Should I live in a camper or my car and try and survive the winters of Maine? Sometimes I only think about one option: prematurely ending my existence. But I cannot do that, I love life and myself and I cannot let this economic system hurt me.

Now I'm at a turning point. My room-mate needs to move, like next week, and I've already been doing shitty at my job lately because I'm a depressed mess. I've also been moving toward freelance work, I've been looking for clients for work such as housecleaning or babysitting, so that I can make just enough to survive. This is my chance to move away from the 9-5 (or in my case, 1:30-10) life, the boring life and move toward freedom. What's the point of working full-time, and making enough money, if I don't have enough time to actually enjoy life? These past few days I've been extremely happy again because I feel like if I can work hard toward an anti-work lifestyle I can reach my goals toward a more free life. I'm getting clients now for freelance work (I need to work so I can afford food, my phone bill, and my hormone medications because I'm transgender.) and thinking about how I can live life with more time on my hands. 

I'm a little nervous. I will have to be moved out of this apartment by the end of December, but not sure what to do next. Ideally I want a small motor-home so that I can live rent-free and travel, but I don't have any money saved up unfortunately. I also do not want to live in my car. It's very cold at night and I like to shower everyday. I could move back in with my parents but I really want to be independent and I don't want them to be disappointing in me. I really should just stay where I am in life, but I cannot afford to be a wage slave any longer. I HAVE to change, to save myself and my mental health. Unfortunately I'm very impulsive but lately I've been trying to plan things out.

Has anyone else made a sudden change from a wage slave life to a more free anti-work life? I really want to live this life so that I can have more time to reach my goals. I really want to have time to actually TRAVEL the country, have time for friends and family, have time for art and political activism and education. I don't care if it's hard, I don't care if I have to live in my car or whatever, I honestly need to live anti-work in order to save my life and live life to the fullest.",False,e2d0ur,cops_throat_my_cock,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e2d0ur/i_am_moving_toward_a_more_free_life_and_im_both/,4,1

I did absolutely nothing wrong in this job, but I got fucked either way.

She said it was ok but apparently it wasn't and when i left she just run her stupid mouth.

145,Time Based Pricing,"Here's an idea to fix the mess we're living in:

**Time Based Pricing**

Below some **examples**:

A cup of coffee costs everyone 1 minute of working.

A bag of groceries enough for one household (4 persons) for one day costs everyone 1 hour of working.

A new commuter car costs everyone 2 months of working.

A Ferrari costs everyone 1 year of working.

An apartment costs everyone 1 year of working.

A house costs everyone 1.5 years of working.

A large mansion costs everyone 4 years of working.

--

Before people start to rage that this is a bad idea, take time (no pun intended) to think about it and give reasons why this would be a bad idea in your opinion. (I'm absolutely not dogmatic about this idea, and it could be that I'm missing something very important, that this idea, might in fact be dangerous or something.)

--

Everyone is always saying time = money.

With 'time worked' as a way of paying, things get more equal for everyone.

""But then everyone is going to be an Uber driver / toilet cleaner / painter / crap-art maker / etc.""

By that same 'logic', everyone would be a doctor or pilot right now.

I assure you I'd never want to work as a doctor or pilot. Too much responsibility for me. Even if the education for these jobfunctions were free, I wouldn't do it.

--

If businesses decide to ask 2 days of working for a cup of coffee, then they probably won't get much business.

Other than how it's managed now, landlords can't ask one month of working as the renting price, unless they allow 10 persons in the house.

--

""How are people going to be able to spend their 'worked hours'?""

Pretty much the same as it is now. 1 credit per minute or something.

--

""Who controls the credit system?""

Who controls it now?

--

""It means there's an *unlimited* amount to spend. Inflation, etc.""

Not sure about that, as one needs to work. No work means no credits. The more people work, the more credits there will be.

--

""What if there isn't enough work to do?""

We need to realize that this is already the case with automation/robots taking over. It means we either should all benefit from these robots or cost of living should be (far) more reasonable and affordable.

--

""This idea is extremely dangerous.""

Why?

--

""What about the people who are doing labor that they can only do for 4 hours a day?""

Why should we work more than 4 hours a day anyway?

--

It's an idea. Obviously it's never going to be implemented, because TPTB won't let it happen, but it's an idea.

147,Super frustrated. My boss won’t get off my ass,"So I’ve been working at a small business for over a year now and almost out of no where, the owner/boss started getting on my ass for slip ups and minor mistakes. Some of it is perfectly warranted, and I’ve tried to adjust accordingly. But other issues he’s raised are nitpicks like:

1- “Why don’t you come in early anymore? Are you starting to slip?” 

When I first started, I used to come in early. Eventually I saw that there was absolutely no benefit to continue to do this. FYI I’m the only employee who continually comes in on time or early. The other employees are either 15min late every day or an hour late EVERY DAY. My complaints to the boss/owner about the tardiness of my coworkers (that leaves me alone on shifts sometimes) were met with excuses and double standards about how long they’ve worked here, I’m being too harsh, blah blah. 
When I was coming in early, I ended up fulfilling duties they should’ve been doing if THEY WERE ON TIME. So I decided to just come in on time when scheduled (but still not late).

2- “Why don’t you clean like you used to? Are you getting complacent?”

When I was first hired, the first thing I noticed was that the place was a disgusting mess. So in order to show “leadership” and “initiative” I began to clean the store at least once a week as well as attempt to clean whenever there’s down time. My coworkers stations were/are so disgusting and cluttered that I couldn’t even begin to clean without bothering their daily routines. My suggestion for them to help me fell on deaf ears. 
A year later and I’m still the only one who cleans. So I decided that I’m only going to straighten up the bare minimum (once a week) and nothing else. I have the same responsibilities as my coworkers and I get paid less than them, what am I? The personal maid around here?!

3- Miscellaneous issues with my timesheet

So this one really bothers me. At this backwards ass job, we have to calculate everything with our timesheets: our hours, our labor commissions, our floor sales commissions, receipt numbers, people we worked with, etc. etc. and email them to the owner/boss who submits it to a third party payroll company that pays us.
I’ve never been at a place that operated this way. Usually there’s someone, like a manager, who calculates most of this stuff with the assistance of a time clock program or something.
Anyway, over the last 3 weeks, my boss has been riding me about errors I’ve made with my math when it comes to my commissions. Again, some of these complaints seemed to make sense at first, as I know I’ve made a mistake or two in the past. But now I’m beginning to get suspicious or at least paranoid that he’s trying to rip me off or something. It’s happening far too often despite how careful I’ve been.

NOW MY COMPLAINTS

1- We don’t get breaks. We just don’t. I’m tired of being unable to get through a meal without interruption.

2- We’re on camera all day and we’re watched by the boss/owner and micromanaged on occasion.

3- I’m tired of being messaged about work shit on my time off or day off.

4- One coworker in particular is hostile. He demeans everyone, is blatantly racist, sexist, etc. and loses his temper whenever he’s slightly inconvenienced. I could have a line of customers and he won’t help. He just stays in the back.

158,This might not necessarily be anti work but I’m pissed off with work situation,I’m 30. Was unemployed probably 5 years in total. I’ve also done 5 years of education which i subsequently failed. Finally doing a job that pays a wage I can live on. Unfortunately my probation has been extended so my future is in doubt. Every job though I haven’t been good at. I’m either too slow I or I make too many mistakes. Even when I was at McDonald’s I didn’t assert myself enough to get given more responsibility or anything. I’m quite confident with friends and family but put me in a working environment where I have to establish relationships I’m all weak and passive. I have a bearable job as far as jobs go. It’s working as a postman. They offer some stuff that other companies wouldn’t. I’d like to keep it. I don’t know what will happen if I lose this. It’ll be back to the drawing board I suppose. I don’t know if I’ll get another job as a courier and I’m not a very good driver so I’m not sure if I’ll even pass their driving assessments. Feel kinda screwed tbh.

161,Economic Possibilities For Our Grandchildren,"Recently I read an essay by John Maynard Keynes called Economic Possibilities For Our Grandchildren, which was pretty depressing. In the essay, he states that because of improving technology, efficiency, and productivity, by the time his grandchildren are his age (which is now) the average worker will only have to work 15 hours a week, and they will be paid more than they were in his time. Obviously this hasn't happened, but it's not because he was too far off base.

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, there was a trend of workers working less and being paid more, while the overall production of the economy increased, due to improvements in technology and productivity. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average worker had to work pretty much constantly just to barely scrape by. By 1900 it was around 65 hours a week, and by 1930 it was about 55 hours. At the same time, the average income for the middle and lower class was slowly but steadily gaining. But around the 1950's-1960's time period, this trend all but stopped.

Wages stagnated and haven't really grown since, and the hours worked has barely budged and has even increased in several industries and professions. Basically, the worker is working just as hard as they were 60 years ago with no gains to show for it. This isn't because the economy hasn't grown. Keynes predicted that by this time, technology and productivity improvements may have caused the economy to multiply by eight times. This was actually a low estimate, and the surplus wealth in the economy has multiplied many dozens of times since then. So why hasn't the well being of the worker increased along with it?

If you follow this subreddit you probably already know. The vast majority of the incredible gains of the American economy over the past 60 years have gone straight to the pockets of the wealthy. While the workers position has remained stagnant decade after decade, the rich have doubled their wealth year after year after year. 

To further confirm this, a study showed that the average worker today produces the same amount of product in 11 hours that a worker in 1950 could produce in 40 hours. And though consumption has obviously increased in recent decades, that doesn't even come close to accounting for this. The worker today has come to accept that they will never see their lives improve, they will never get a break, and they will never see the value created by their labor. They accept that they are being exploited, and it's a travesty.

The main thing we can do is try to organize and educate our fellow workers, both within the workplace and in politics. I'm currently nearing the end of college, and when I graduate I'm going to join the labor force full time, rather than just part time as I'm doing now.

167,You can never have enough money.,"Thats the trap. No matter how much money people make, they can always make more (and they always want to make more). A lucky few get rich and make millions, but even they are not happy. They are still trying to make more. The average person never gets to make millions of dollars though, so the dream of finally making enough to relax and enjoy life acts like the carrot on a stick that keeps them going.

What nobody ever tells them is that if you spend 50 years of your lufe in a state of tension chasing money, when you finally retire you'll wont be able to relax because always doing something and working has become a habit. So alot of retired people either get depressed or they go back to work because its where their whole identity is based.

187,Rant,"I know this is majorly a meme/reaction community, but I feel that if I rant to you, you will get it. I’ll be happy if you read it, I expect nothing beyond that.

I am in my early 30s, have been working continuously for about 11 years now. I am what I guess is called a “highly skilled professional”, meaning I have an office job that pays way above the median. I live and work in a first-world European country meaning that I’m easily in the top 0.5% of the global population income-wise.

It’s a day before payday today. I have about $5 cash, and close to $20k of debt. I don’t have anything of value. No house nor flat, no bonds or shares, no jewellery or works of art. No savings of any kind. If I sold everything I own I might get maybe $3k? Hard to tell - a dated gaming pc, some tools and power tools, some kitchen stuff, stacks of books.

I don’t have a car or a licence - I did a course years ago, so I know how to, but never did the exam because money. And also didn’t have money for the car anyway, and I wouldn’t use it daily as public transport was and is much quicker.

I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t do any kind of drugs. I don’t smoke tobacco (I admittedly vape). I might spend up to a $100 per month on games - humble bundles, some dlc to my favourites, but of pay2win crap elsewhere.

I wear clothes I have. I’m not bothered by labels, I don’t have anything of a recognisable brand. I buy just “quality” clothes that will last me a long time, and usually only replace them. Trends don’t apply to me, I’m either jeans and t-shirt most of the days, and tweed if I feel fancy.

I rent a flat, I’d say in the middle of a price range. 1 bedroom, rather cramped, but good commute and safe neighbourhood.

I spend probably a bit too much on takeout, because as much as I love cooking, after a full day of work it’s not very enjoyable. But still, it’s maybe 5-6 times a month, and it’s pizza or McDonalds, nothing fancy.

I also spend a bit too much on food. I could go for “Italian style hard cheese” instead of Parmesan, or just bacon instead of pancetta, but did I mention I love cooking? Also candies and pastries - I’m a sweet tooth, sue me.

I haven’t had a steak in months. Beef is too expensive. Usually the meat is either sausage, bacon or sometimes mince. Often there’s no meat, just legumes, cheese, eggs and dairy as a source of fat and protein.

I have stopped going to Starbucks and other crap coffee establishments, switched to black tea with milk. I stopped eating lunch at work, I’ll just bring something from home to keep me going until the evening.

And I’m still just spiralling down. Well, I kind of know why. I have two people who are financially dependent on me. Don’t really want to go into why and how, but the fact is they are, and if I leave them hanging they are absolutely and completely screwed.

One of them I just spend flat 18.5% of salary on as a handout. The second lives with me, so it’s hard to estimate the actual cost. Some electricity, some food, some cash. While it does explain the gaping budget hole, I’m still blaming the current economy for it. I’m supposedly wealthy, on paper, aren’t I?

Recently I’ve been looking around on an app there like a Facebook for neighbourhoods. I did some computer repair, pc building for an older couple, I did some handyman work as well - I’m a DIY enthusiast. While I highly enjoyed it, I also did it for money. Some bucks here, some bucks there. Usually I just say with perfect honesty that I’m not a registered self employed person, so I cannot ask for any money, but I can accept a gift. People are quite generous when they are happy with what I do, and I’m an honest and conscientious guy. I show up on time, I get stuff done, I don’t bullshit.

However as I’ve mentioned I don’t have a car. I also don’t want to incur wrath of the tax authorities. So I only just offer my services, outside of my day job hours, on the neighbour board, when someone is looking for something I can do. I don’t advertise, because I feel it would be silly to be a handyman on the weekends and late evenings only. But I’m happy to do some actual work with my hands, interact with people, and put the tools to use (as I’m currently renting a flat, they don’t see any real use).

I’m at the end of a rope really. I probably could Hail Mary, get a loan from my bank and continue the status quo few more months, but that is not a solution.

I will probably be forced to hang one of the people who are dependent on me out to dry. And it’s killing me. I worked hard for over a decade, I’m really good at what I do. I kept away from most vices, I spend my free time either doing some side gigs for spare change or doing things for friends for free - tutoring, helping, you name it.

I tried to live my life as my mother taught me. Don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t backstab, love people, help others, be happy with what you have. I also listened to my dad: work hard, do your best, bear the cross.

I’m now on heavy antidepressants, after over 15 years of battling depression on my own. I never surrendered to the demons inside me which propose such simple and alluring solutions to my anguish. It did help to think that my life has meaning to others, and that’s why it is so hard right now. I’m presented with a choice of basically betraying the way I lived my life and abandon someone, or keep trying to carry that cross of mine, hoping it doesn’t crush me. 

But I’ve tried and tried and just can’t. I did some math recently. In the past 5 years at my company I’ve had two pay rises, one of them due to a promotion. I’ve applied the inflation, the taxes and I now earn 2% less than 5 years ago in actual purchasing power. The game is rigged. The inflation is and the power of the government, but the salaries at the hands of the private. And yes, I could play that game. Leverage the employer, hunt for better paying job, start my own business. But all those things require money to start with. And with no savings, only debt, it’s a no go. And to build the capital I’d have to implement radical cost saving measures which in turn bring me back to abandoning another human in need.

I won’t lie, I’d gladly work more to make ends meet. I hate working in general, I’m an UBI supporter and proponent, I can do a lot of things for the world outside of my job, but I’d be lying if I said that I wouldn’t work more.

However, no paid overtime at my company, just TOIL (time off in-lieu). And finding another employer in my field who would want my services during my free time proved to be very hard. I did offer around some freelance services (so work whenever, deliver on agreed time), but that’s also rare, and a lot of that stuff can be outsourced for cheap.

This is incredibly long and if you got to the end, thank you. I really just needed to vent, to put my thoughts in order, and I don’t like to write things that will never see the light of day. Thank you.",False,e0y0tq,20191124anon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e0y0tq/rant/,19,1

The best example of easy job that I know, is guardian for art galleries or small museums, you basically just have to be there.

196,How to Appeal to More Moderates,"This is a great sub. But here are some tips to get more people on your side.

1. We're all in agreement that the work week is much too long. 40 hours is OVERKILL - especially for people in the knowledge economy.
2. More telecommuting options are needed. THERE IS NO NEED TO COMMUTE TO AN OFFICE FIVE DAYS A WEEK ANYMORE. Wake up, fucking boomers! There's this thing called the internet.

Now, some of us expect to get living wages from minimum wage jobs. That ain't gonna happen, sorry. Automation will just replace those jobs anyway eventually. Besides, less than 3% of the total work force in the USA makes minimum wage jobs (Source: BLS) so it isn't this MASSIVE block of people making crappy wages.

To get more people on your side, you need less of the minimum wage whiners and more of the people making $60,000-$100,000 a year on your side.

To do that, you really need to focus on #1 and #2 above. A lot of people, including me, love our jobs. We're just overworked and have outdated ways of doing work (going to an office for example).",False,e0l8a7,etoxQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e0l8a7/how_to_appeal_to_more_moderates/,18,1

I’ll get to it quick, basically all the aspects of working (the time spent, the formula to keep us unhappy so we spend, working to make someone else rich at something I’m not even interested in, crap pay) drive me absolutely insane. It doesn’t matter what the job is, I’ll start to go mad and feel trapped in a loop after a few months. 

I decided I would try to become a nurse, as they have a lot of days off and get good money...but the program is extraordinarily hard, I have no love for it (my true passion is art/music), and I recently just...stopped going to school. I’m working part time, which I originally got because of my school schedule, but I’m thinking of keeping it (for my sanity) and pursing my art 100%

Should I be terribly worried about how broke I’m going to be? Right now I’m not, I’m more focused on being happy, but I’m just wondering is this even practical?

199,I need to rant about call centres,"I absolutely killed myself working for a telecoms company. I took pride in my work and pushed for the best stats in the place (I got a badge for being top 100 😓). Not an actual monetary benefit. 

Every time I peaked and hit a target, they switched the goal posts and pushed me harder for the next threshold.

There is no endgame! No completion or reward. They just squeeze and push you on repeat.

My immune system was shattered by stress so I took some sick days to recover, they put me in a room and had me justify the sicknesses infront of three managers. They put me on a ""sickness stage"" which is essentially a disciplinary after weeks of hounding because I didn't want to take strong painkillers to get me back into work. 

I was micro managed to a ridiculous extent, penalised for taking too many pee breaks basically forcing me into a state of permanent dehydration. I was placed in an ""evaluation"" where I again had to justify the amount of times a day I urinate! These meetings play out like police interrogations. 

Any sort of career progression involves being a manager on secondment, this is something I'd never heard of before working there. What it essentially means is you are a manager, with all of the responsibilities but none of the pay. You do the exact same job as managers. You've got all these desperate people wanting a better wage, absolutely killing themselves for the title. They're taking their work home with them living and breathing the company in the hopes of getting paid for what they're already doing! I knew secondment managers that hadn't been offered the actual job for 5 years! 

The company would fend us off against other call centres in stat competitions and reward us for winning. They gave us little packets of haribo, one year they put a ferris wheel in the carpark. They'd give us a spin on a roulette wheel for transferring to sales, 1 in 10 chance of a 2 minute break.      

I'm just so sick of being treated like a fucking child with these pseudo rewards so they dont have to fork out for any meaningful rewards...yno...like money. Or being fairly paid for the work you do.

The absolute worst thing of all is the people around me eat this shit up! They love it! You're taught to think you're some sort of grinch if you dont play along with a smile on your face. If you dont take the overtime when asked you're considered a maverick.

And the long term managers...holy shit. The personality types they hire for these positions are uniform. These small people who milk situations of hierarchy and a minuscule amount of power for all it's worth. You can tell they relish their position because it gives them the opportunity to talk to you poorly. 

I managed to get out of there and into a more traditional office job where they treat you like an adult. But to all my brothers and sisters still in the trenches, please know that you come first! 

Your mental and physical well being must be a priority. They will make you feel guilty and shame you into pushing past your own boundaries just because they did the same.

200,The Belmont School,"&amp;#x200B;

Born to a family in America’s lower middle class, I worked my way through a bachelor’s in mathematics. For whatever reason, I had loads of trouble finding internships throughout university. I got one, but it was volunteer. The work was good, I was helping organize bee farms in a village in Africa, but as I needed money I couldn’t dedicate much to that. I had to work. I worked in restaurants and did manual labor mostly. After I graduated, I still couldn’t find meaningful (read: high paying and/or interesting) so I got a job with a moving company. Moving things.

It was here that I felt the most horrible reality I had ever had to face so far in my life. It was here I realized no matter how much I worked, no matter how much I studied, no matter how much I appreciated the world and culture, that I would never be able to leave my caste. I was set far behind from the bourgeoisie, and I was low class. End of story. This moving company allowed me to feel the full weight of that.

One Saturday, the crew and I had to empty a high end private elementary school in a very wealthy town. I got there about 6am with my team and we started emptying it out. People started showing up for whatever reason. There were two ways we were looked at by the people within the establishment 1) with pity 2) with disgust. It was plainly obvious that we were different. First of all, our group was a motley one, varying races and ethnic/cultural backgrounds, I mean. Our masters on the other hand were entirely white. The older women who looked at us almost uniformly did it with pity, and they even attempted to ‘tip’ us. Personally, I find that extremely degrading, so I was put in a horribly bad mood already. Almost all the men and many of the middle-aged women looked at us with disgust. Almost as if they did not recognize us as human. \*I should mention at this point that the *vast* majority of folks here did not even notice us or ignored us, this is a fairly small minority of people I am talking about with disgust/pity\* I say this because at least three of us were almost hit by cars, as though we were rodents in the way of their Escalades, in the parking lot. 

The day was wearing on and we were all exhausted. I became almost physically ill when the manager of our company came and brownnosed the super of the school and I even heard him apologize for some of the men’s appearance. I was appalled and disgusted. Now it is about ninety-five degrees and I am exhausted. I start walking back towards the cigarette scented semi that took me here when I hear something very nice. It was part of Mozart’s 40th symphony. Neither the tonality nor musicality was there, but I love art pretty much always. It was very refreshing after a day of work to hear the piece. I fell into the gravitational field of the music and wandered closer, unconsciously. Finally, I saw a bunch of children playing the piece with a woman probably in her fifties conducting it. I watched for a few moments and went from happy to hear the music to completely dejected. It was as though I had become awakened from a dream. I realized in that moment; I could not be like them. I love their music, I love their art, I love their easy lifestyle, I desperately want to have their educations and opportunities, but right then, I realized that those things aren’t for me. They are for them. I am a utility, I help their communities run, I do the work they don’t want to, and what do I get for it? I get ignored. I get pitied. I remembered all the times I spoke to people above my caste, “Oh wow, you know Schoenberg? I am very surprised” or the most memorable one, “I believe that even people like you could achieve in an elite university”. The realization crushed me with an immense weight, almost making me drop to my knees.  I have never felt more worthless or hopeless than in that moment. I wept when I got home until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I went to the next job.

Postscript:

202,Please bear with me through this diary entry of a post,"I am 23. I've been working 45 hours a week for the past 7 months. My job has afforded me the opportunity to live in the city I wanted to. Half of my biweekly paycheck goes to rent. It's not possible to save money where I live, I understand that. I get it, I accept it. I just wanted an opportunity to get the fuck out of my parent's basement. I wanted so badly to leave there, and it's funny how, now, in hindsight, I would do anything to pack up to return to that basement.

Here's the thing about full-time, office work. YOU BECOME DEVOID OF *THOUGHT*! without THOUGHT, there is no EXISTENCE, you see . . . 

I come home at night, I'm tired as all hell, I wake up tired, I go to work and I'm tired. With my tire comes a nonexistence. I don't care about my job, I don't care about the work. It's all so remarkably meaningless. I can feel myself shrinking. I can feel myself melting into the abyss of pure nothingness. This is not hyperbole, my friends. This is the reality of what work does to a man.

My question is this: How do I escape? I have 6 months left on my lease. I can't just get up and leave, so I'll need to afford the monstrous rent for the remainder of time. 6 months. Half a year of continued decay. That shit can bring a man to tears, fucking Lord and Jesus.

Apologies for this diary entry. I'm just so very tired. I haven't the slightest fucking clue how folks do this for decades. I'd rather be in a minimum-security prison, reading books and working out for years.

I'm begging for somebody to understand what I'm saying. I feel like a madman sometimes when my friends and family simply can't wrap their head around what I'm trying to articulate -- however jumbled it might be. And it is jumbled, surely. How can it not be?

206,From “The Glass Escalator Revisiting: Gender Inequality in Neoliberal Times” by Christine Williams,"However, upbraiding these jobs may not be in the interests of all women.
I do not assume that the women at the top of the occupational pyramid
share common cause with the women at the bottom any more than men do.
‘It ExxonMobil corporate headquarters in Houston, for example, janitors,
who currently am $8.35 an hour, are fighting for a pay raise. Of course,
because of the neoliberal work organization, they don’t actually work for
ExxonMobil; they work for cleaning subcontractors who bid on temporary
contracts to provide cleaning services, and who employ lesions of women
workers on an “as needed” basis. Consequently, the spokesperson for
ExxonMobil can claim that his company doesn’t “have anything to do
with” the low wages paid to janitors who clean their offices.’ But there is
no question that the immense profits of the oil and gas industry and the
high pay of the geoscientists who work for it come from squeezing the
workers on the bottom. Outsourcing, temporalizing, and shifting risk onto
workers is the essence of the neoliberal business model.

For these reasons, I believe that feminist demands for gender equality
in the workplace are not enough. To women janitors deserve to be treated
the same as men janitors? Yes, of course they do. But they also deserve
more than $8.35 an hour, which will not happen unless their employers are
forced to pay them more. That is why a critique of capitalism must accord-
any our critique of gender inequality. His is my “new” feminist agenda
for the sociology of work.

His “new” agenda is in fact at least 40 years old, hardening back to the
“socialist feminist” of the 1970s. That agenda has been lost in recent
years, overcome by what Fancy Fraser has called the “feminist romance
with capitalism” (2009, 110). His is the idea that women’s emancipation
requires their entry into paid work. His idea has been used to motivate
women around the world to seek dignity and equality in the labor
market—even though, for the vast majority of women, paid work is son-
anonymous with extreme exploitation and family hardship. Feminist school-
as rightly criticize women’s economic dependency on men and the
evaluation of women’s daring labor in the home. But we must not ignore
the fact that the alternative can be just as bad. Capitalists rely on women’s
unpaid work in the home to reproduce the labor force AND they exploit
women’s labor to generate enormous profits. In effect, they have had-
passed the dream of women’s liberation to the engine of capitalist act-
emulation. Feminist have been implicit with this insular as we endorse
the model of competitive individuals in the marketplace for women
(Collins and Layer 2010; Eisenstein 2010). I now believe that a feminist

that is divorced from a critique of capitalism will only make things worse
for most women.

The glass escalator explains the advantages that straight white men
receive in professional jobs in traditional work organizations. Because it
analyze male privilege without critiquing capitalist exploitation, it loses
sight of the diminishing rewards available to most workers. It may be time
to retire the concept. He need new metaphor to explain gender inequality
in our neoliberal age.

219,Employment Agencies Where You Are?,"Hello there, I'm from Australia and I'm very much underemployed, so I've been at an employment agency for several months now. And my god they're so inefficient and almost perfectly not helpful. 

Our government is run by the Liberal party, who are our right wing conservatives, and I know that our job agencies use public money to make profits for private companies.

Luckily the whole place seems to be moving into an online-only model - which sucks for the workers there, but at least I won't have to come in every single day to fill out pointless sheets and look for jobs under their supervision.

What they've got people doing is this; you have an obligation to apply for a set number of jobs per month - I was on 20, but it's been lowered to 11 for the time being. They've got a lot of us to come in every day Monday to Friday and spend about 3 hours  basically cold calling employers - what sort of approach is this? Employers must hate it. They also promise to get us all the licenses and qualifications we need, but very often they'll just tell us to not bother because we don't have a job lined up.

It's clear the whole system is purposely designed to demoralize and demonize job seekers, to make them so fed up with it all that they stop coming to appointments and then get their welfare payments cut. I used to think that places like this where just inefficient and broken in the way that lots of places just are, because people are stupid. But damn, I'm now fully aware that the inefficiency and cruelty is built into the system, the Liberal Party hates poor people and is actively punishing them with cruel systems like our job agencies.

They were all cold, brainwashed by this system known as capitalism. I’ll never forget the demented look in their eyes. No sense of humor or humanity, 100% self centered. I’ve not heard from either of them, I think their senses told them deep down I’m not that interested. It feels like everyone is obsessed with a fake social hierarchy rather than seeing the benefit of individual traits. Everyone has their strengths, we evolved this way. I would never call someone “my boss” or “my manager” - how can you claim someone is “your boss?” To use the word of conservative suck ups, yes that makes you the biggest cuck of all in the animal kingdom.

Everyone says this is the best time to be alive. Just because capitalism is at it’s peak and the world is economically better off than it was 50 years ago, it doesn’t mean we’re better off. In fact, people have never been more unhappy. Suicide rates are at their highest levels, look at the proportion of people in the west taking antidepressants. Whilst money is a more efficient tool than barter, it’s a human invention and makes up only a tiny part of life. Yet it’s all people care about. No one has time for anyone, just their own greed so they can consume more things that supposedly make happy, when it reality it makes them miserable and unhealthy. People use “sorry but I’m at work” as an excuse to get out of everything. But can you blame them, because I understand it’s exhausting wearing a fake corporate mask all day around people who wouldn’t be phased if you died. Working a lot doesn’t make you a hero, it makes you a sad sheep, stop bragging about all the overtime you worked. When I look around most people aren’t healthy, look at the deadness in their eyes, the blackness underneath. They have to take stimulants just to keep going, downing multiple coffees throughout the day, drinking alcohol at the weekend to mask their pain.

Consumerism strongly goes against the evolution of humans. It kills our morality and opposes our natural requirements of good health (you can’t be healthy working all the time in most jobs), family and community. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I’ve never been interested in consuming plastic junk; what do I need it for? It doesn’t make me happy. Expensive products just are a burden and a liability.

 With the technology and scientific understanding we have, we could constantly strive for perfection. But people always have to be doing something. Interfering with and destroying their surroundings. Here’s a beautiful river, lets purchase a loud boat to spew out diesel fumes into the water and effect the whole ecosystem. Isn’t this beautiful? That’s a nice forest, let me burn these trees down and cover it in concrete, don’t you love my home? We no longer live amongst the natural environment, we live fighting against it. There is no peace or silence ever. Simplicity is better. Once men used to be just hunters, instead they’ll scam their neighbor just for money?

When I sit at standstill in traffic, I cannot help but think, in what way are we benefiting the world? As we are at the moment we’re a major burden in so many ways, casting pain and fear throughout planet Earth. Most jobs don’t benefit humanity at all, they go against it. Noise, pollution, unhealthy chemicals are pumped out of their metal boxes, breathed in by the same people. Cities were designed for cars, not walking. Cars that are paid for and maintained by the employee, just so they can get to work. There's always only one person in each car. How is that supposedly efficient or sustainable as capitalism tells us?

The poorest countries in the world have the lowest suicide rates out of all countries, the evidence is there. If neo-liberalism is the most effective system then how come I’m at my happiest when I have nothing? When I walk through the forest is the only time I’m truly happy.

I’m not against all work, just work in the way it is now. Many jobs need not exist at all, a lot of people spend their time just pretending to look busy. Society would be much better off if we worked for the best interests of the future of the planet, for humanity, rather than soulless corporations. If people followed the laws of science, of nature, of what’s best for all of us we could develop in a healthy and sustainable way.

The problem is everyone just goes along with it without question. They even enjoy it, spouting nonsense and lies fed to them by advertisements and the media since birth. Sucking on the feet of the wealthy, voting against their own interests in the hope one day they will be rich. The media is obsessed with identity politics, divide and conquer has never gotten old and has never been more effective.

247,"After 19 years, I've finally realized I spent my entire life working hard to become a slave","It's the end of the second semester of my sophomore year in college. I'm majoring in Computer Science. This means I have a ton of assignments due next week and I've only finished one so far. What a terrible time to come to this sub and have the epiphany.

I've been a responsible kid for a good portion of my life. I studied a lot and got very good grades. My classmates called me a 'nerd'. There were two main reasons for which I dedicated myself to study: 1. To have more days of vacation and 2. To achieve my dreams. Since I was a small child I've dreamed of moving abroad: some times it would be America, other times the UK, other times Canada and a few times Japan (I'm from Brazil btw). All my life I've lived in fear. I can't leave the door of my house and go for walk unless I want to be robbed. I can't use headphones in the parking lot of the mall unless I want to attract the eyes of robbers. The mere sight of a motorcycle on a street sends shivers down my spine. Stories of burglaries and robberies are something I hear often from acquaintances, and I've experienced it directly, since I've been robbed once. That's why I've always wanted to escape from all that shit. I didn't want to live in constant fear for the rest of my life, I don't think that's a life with dignity. I thought if I studied and worked hard enough I'd be able to move to an idyllic place where I'd live a happy and fulfilling life surrounded by great people. 

My energy was sucked by school but I was still satisfied because I was always looking forward: to the next holiday, the next winter break and, in the more distant future, a happy life in a place I loved. My mental health started deteriorating in my sophomore year of HS. I had to go biking twice a week at night to clear my mind of all the stress. It was hard but I kept moving forward. When the time came to choose my future path I chose Computer Science. I liked coding and the idea of having a high-paying job in California sounded nice to me.

My first semester in college was pretty cool. I had more free time than when I was in HS and I liked the subjects I was studying. Then things started to change. It became much more demanding and I started hating my life. It wears me down. Every day that I have to go to those dull-looking classrooms and watch lectures for 6 hours sucks my life energy a bit more. I spend my weekdays thinking of my weekends (which I mainly use for studying and doing assignments, but they make me feel *a lot* better than going every single day to college). Fortunately, whenever I'm feeling completely worn out I can simply miss classes. I don't need to explain to anyone why I missed, because it's our right to miss 25% of all the class hours in a semester. That's what keeps me sane. 

And then it struck me some time ago. I'm not going to have this luxury when I start working. I won't work for *just* 6 hours every day, I'll work 8 hours. I only have 4 days of class per week, but that number's going to increase to 6 when I start working full-time. I won't have 4 months of vacation per year, I'll only have 1 (that's assuming I live in Brazil, if I move to America, it's going to be half that number). I won't be able to simply miss work whenever I want, I'll have to justify it every time and I know I'll feel guilty and afraid of calling in sick when I get sick. 

This leaves very little time for the things that make us humans happy and healthy. Exercise? Either squeeze it in the morning and neglect sleeping or do at night when you're exhausted from spending the entire day working. Sunlight? Better get used to spending 5/7 of your life not seeing the sun. Socializing? The best you'll get is hanging out with your friends on Sunday with each passing hour weighing on your mind as you get closer and closer to Monday. 

Work is not sunshine and rainbows like I thought it was, it's actually the complete opposite of it. I hear adults saying it all the time: ""I thought I had it bad in HS until I went to college. Then I thought I had it bad in college until I started working."" Now I understand why. I look at the full-time working adults around me and (maybe I'm wrong?) none of them looks really happy. They either look like tired all the time or stressed all the time. Some of them keep their sanity by thinking of retirement. But the thought of spending my entire life unhappily surviving until I can retire at 65 is frankly depressing.

No matter where you live (even if it's not a crime-ridden shithole like the one I live) that's a miserable existence.

I found this sub yesterday and I'm thankful that there are other people who aren't being fooled by the lies they feed us every day. Now it makes me even more sick in the stomach when I hear people like my dad (who have miserable lives) singing praises to capitalism and spewing the bullshit they watch on YouTube far-right channels. 

The worst thing I've realized is that all my hard work was in vain. I can't believe society led me to believe being a corporate slave was a dream worth pursuing. I wasn't any wiser than the people who spent their teenage years having fun. In the end we're all going to end up equally miserable. 

I guess now this realization will haunt me for the rest of my life. That I'm putting all my talent and energy into making a rich person richer and destroying my mental health in the process.

282,[RANT] The work means nothing,"I'm an IT Sales guy an I've had to work from home the past 4 works due to a medical condition.
In the past 4 weeks I've attained 48% of my quarterly goal and also been awarded MVP at the company.
Working from home provided me with extra time to sleep.  I didn't have to drive anywhere.  I saved a lot of money and time just cutting out my commute.  My job is meaningless in the sense that I just forward emails to people.  In these 4 weeks I was able to do a ton of cleanup/organization around the house and even work on art projects (read: improving and working on myself).  I finished a commission piece that I delayed for months, usually delayed it because I was too tired to work on it after being in the office all day.
That's not to say that my work from home experience was entirely stress free, I had some bad/busy work days, but the nature of my work simply doesn't require 8 hours a day in an office, obviously, given the attention directed at ""work"" while I've been at home.

The only thing is, I would have paid probably $600 out of pocket to go through all my medical bullshit without the health insurance provided by my employer.  It's a rusty, double-edged sword.  

I can't fake my illness any longer and have to go back to the office on Monday.  This shit sucks.  My experience in the past month shows me that the work is meaningless.  This lifestyle is worthless.  I'm wasting my time sending emails for somebody who doesn't care about anything other than their ever-expanding bottom line.  I have to depend on putting my time in with this entity in order to afford to live without fear of sudden and detrimental debt.  It's such a cruel existence.

After this happened, another good friend of mine who hasn't yet fucked me over (I don't think he will to be fair but I also have lost all trust in everyone,) offered me 1% of his not-yet-profitable company that I've also done a little bit of work for. He wants me to do some graphic design work, not a lot, just some ads and such that I could make up in less than an hour. He's on the same path as me work wise, except he has a family, so I'd like to help him regardless of pay.

I have also just finished the first issue of my 2nd comic series, something which I've made a little bit of money off of but not a lot.

My main issue is that I don't know if I can make it off my art and graphic designing alone. I know my work is good quality but I don't know how to market myself. And I know if I go back to work I won't have the time or energy to work on these things that actually do make me happy.

I really want to go to work for a tattoo parlor, I have my certification. Regular retail or food service work just fucking kills me. The moment I clocked in at work like that I could feel my soul draining out of me. It just doesn't seem worth it. What's the point in working at a regular job if it makes me want to kill myself?

As a slight side note, my family is visiting this week, and my aunt was telling me all about how successful her daughter is (I have always been compared to my cousins as the lesser one because I had a broken family,) how shes got her own place and a terrific job and how amazingly well shes doing!
I started feeling bad about myself until, ""...she can afford her anti-depression meds too, shes got really great insurance! Her therapist is right by her job as well.""

Oh.
Now, I have nothing against people who take meds for depression, most people I know take them. I have wanted to take them, actually, and I was trying to get in with a therapist or counselor of some kind too...
When I was working.

As of now I have depression from time to time over things not working out (especially right now in the fresh wound of my savings being torn from me by a once trusted friend) but when I'm drawing, or working on my comics, or doing a commission I know I will be paid for, I am happy!

It just makes me feel more determined to make this shit WORK because I know its the only way for me.

I'll be going back to work in January if things don't begin picking up for me right now. Does anyone have any ideas on side gigs I can do from home? I'm kind of attractive so I thought of like, selling nudes or something, Idk. I just genuinely do not want to go back to work and lose the freedom to do the things that give me purpose.",False,e1gvdp,ijustneedadvice89,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/e1gvdp/i_dont_know_how_to_move_on_in_this_work/,18,1

363,We sacrifice our health for this...,"I realized last night how insidious this is - my best friend works in an office. She actually likes her job, which is nice for her. The place that she works is, in all honesty, seemingly far better to its employees than most.

This is a large office building, and it has a cafeteria where they serve all kinds of delicious, calorie laden foods. Think like a high end college cafeteria. 

On a daily basis, when I meet my friend at the gym, she tells me a story almost every day that is food related. Either a coworker has brought in cake or candy, or some dish they made at home to share with people, or the employer themselves is giving out a “reward” of food. Yesterday, it was a “comfort food buffet.”

My friend arrives there at 7:30 in the morning and leaves at 4:30 in the afternoon.

She’s trying to lose weight for her health, but how are you supposed to take care of yourself when you’re at work nine hours a day and people are just throwing food at you all day? And then you sit at a desk. It’s not right.

Add to that about an hour and a half at least of commuting time every day, and she’s set up to fail. 11 of her waking hours are spent essentially stuck in a building, mainly sitting down, or sitting in a car, having unhealthy food offered at every turn.

11 of the supposedly 16 waking hours available to her...

Of course, what actually happens is that she stays up too late, doesn’t get enough sleep, and it just makes things worse.

I almost feel guilty. Because I made a choice three years ago not to go back to full-time work. I knew it was killing me. But she lives alone, she doesn’t really have that option without completely changing her life.

And frankly, I don’t know how it’s going to work out for me long-term. But I just can’t do it.",False,dw8woh,katieleehaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dw8woh/we_sacrifice_our_health_for_this/,6,1

i'm moving dorms this friday and my boss told me that my request to have off (a day in which i work 9-5) is really inconvenient and not ""an ideal situation."" she told me that a lot of interns have been calling out (because of the influx of work) and that she has to say no at some point. she also said i ""made a commitment"" to work 8 hours that day, to which i told her i know, and that's why im telling her a week in advance that im moving. she tried to argue with me asking if i could just move that weekend, and i told her no, because i have plans and it's getting close to finals so i have a lot of assignments.

she said she had to think about it and then she emailed me the next day saying she had spoken to a coworker (who is above her level and who is more understanding) and that they would support me if i really needed to have off that day. but she also asked if i could come in at all that day, even a little. my pity for the office gave in and i agreed to work 3 hours in the morning so that i could get a little work done before im gone the whole day.

in my email confirming this, i asked her: ""in the future, is there another process you would like us to use to call out/request days off? should we be telling you more than a week in advance?"" i hope she reads that question and realizes how dumb it is to say no to someone on the principle that ""she has to say no at some point."" letting your boss know a week in advance you can't work that day is acceptable.

390,It sucks having coworkers with no solidarity,"I work at a major public institution that recently banned smoking, so I usually smoke on the sidewalk right off the formal property. This doesn't make any real difference, since its about five feet distant from where I'd smoke otherwise, but those are the rules, I guess.

Anyway, a person who I see in the hallway and know vaguely I guess saw me smoking a cigarette two feet *onto* our property instead of two feet *off*. I think maybe she said something but I was about 30-40 feet away and couldn't hear. I looked up, and she was hiding behind the bushes, taking pictures of me.

I assume she's going to report me to someone and try to get me in trouble. I'm not terribly concerned, since I've been receiving good feedback thus far, but it just really rankled me. Everyone here is an utterly individualistic prick who spends as much time as possible trying to chide or reprimand their coworkers and peers. It's great for management and bad for the rest of us.

Another example. They recently decided that a failure to lock an office door by janitorial staff would result in an immediate termination of the custodian responsible, even though they replaced our full-time custodians with severely underpaid contractors. They notified of us that *after* an email encouraging us to report failures to lock our office doors. I smelled bullshit from the beginning and didn't report the few times it has happened to me, but I just don't understand what kind of a scum-sucker can report their coworker for such a non issue.

I've only been here six months and it took me a year after grad school to find this, so it's the only thing making me an actual human right now. I hate it here and I'm going to start applying to other positions soon, but in the meantime, I just don't understand why people internalize intra-class aggression instead of like, anything else.",False,dvxp75,DongQuixote1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dvxp75/it_sucks_having_coworkers_with_no_solidarity/,13,1

392,"I recently quit my job because it was destroying my mental health, but even in my final week the company found another reason to convince me that leaving was the right thing.","My job didn't used to be so bad. The work itself wasn't too taxing or too boring, the people were nice, the money was good, and the office was only a 10 minute commute from my house. But over the years the company decided to implement rounds of voluntary redundancies in order to cut costs, so you can see exactly where this is going. Fewer people to do the same amount of work, so everyone had to pick up extra workload and take on additional responsibilities in order to pick up the slack; for the same amount of money, naturally. As a result of all this the company became obsessed with productivity management, so it became a world of stats, targets, performance monitoring, everything that you did being constantly recorded and scrutinised, etc etc. I'm the sort of person who takes pride in their work, and that attitude eventually started to get me in trouble; the company didn't want people taking the time to do things right, they wanted people to just churn out reams of complete garbage in order to satisfy their completely arbitrary (and ever-changing) targets. Couple that with the fact that I can't stand working with someone figuratively looking over my shoulder all the time, so their drive for 'maximising productivity' had the complete opposite effect for me; the more pressure I was under to hit targets, the more stressed and less effective I became. When I started at the company my productivity was fine, but after years of these changes it ended up in the toilet.

This eventually led to me having to take a total of 9 months off work in the last 2 years due to what it was doing to my mental health, and ultimately led me to handing in my notice. I feel relieved at having left, but also guilty; I'm leaving behind a lot of good people who're in the same situation as me, battling with stress/depression/anxiety and regularly having to take time off as a result, but who can't quit because they have more responsibilities (supporting their families etc.) to think about. It sucks.

So that's my rant, but what did the company do in my final week as it's last ""fuck you""? Well, my manager was off on one of her many holidays that week, and it was decided that someone else needed to be in charge in the interim (because obviously we couldn't be trusted to get on with things by ourselves). Now, on my team there were about a dozen people, with 5 of us each having over a decade's experience of the job (myself included). So who did they put in charge? That's right, they chose the temp, the guy who'd been there for 3 months! I know what you're thinking, that that's insane, but don't worry, it's ok; apparently his family are very good friends with our Director of Business Services, so I'm sure that he's got a bright future ahead of him at the company! I even heard that he and the director had started playing golf together, so that's nice. In fact it's quite incredible how well family friends do there, and if your surname happens to be the same as someone else higher up, you're pretty much guaranteed to rise through the ranks. Hmm.

But now thankfully I don't have to put up with that bullshit anymore, at least until I get a job somewhere else and have to deal with whatever dysfunction that particular company has.

The job itself wasn't so bad back when we were tolerated to use smartphones to keep ourselves company but very recently head office had a strict crackdown on smartphone usage and now it's a zero tolerance policy.  This policy has drastically affected me and other employees because now for most of my shift I'm alone with my thoughts with no stimulus or anyone to talk to other than the one customer who comes every odd hour.   This has started to affect me mentally to the point where I'm having conversations with myself or standing next to the window to feel some connection with the outside world. I know you guys think I'm being dramatic but when you work five days a week and 8 hours a day it really takes a toll on you when it starts to feel like solitary confinement.

409,The struggle to date in this hellscape we call society,"My antiwork persona and overall disdain for the chore of the modern day existence was what caused my previous relationship to crumble. My lover unfortunately had to field constant questions from her older brother, and other respected family members about my unwillingness to work full time, and also my comfort in making just enough to get by. I made enough to support my small hobbies of cooking, playing video games, going to movies, playing park basketball, hiking and smoking that good denver grass. My relationship was one of stories of old we were best friends all through our high school years and both attended our local community college and remained close. This developed to full scale lovers through the natural love we held for each other once she moved states away. Once the questions started to come down about my direction in life (seeing that I wasn't going to university because I refused to take on the debt) she would defend me and take my side, but during my brief period as a pizza delivery driver even she mentioned not feeling good about having to tell others what I did for a living. I told her how hurt I was because I thought she saw through that useless identifier and how I thought of myself as so much more than a pizza delivery driver. her older brother was also our roommate so it uncomfortable, him taking issue with my lifestyle and never having the balls to say it to my face, instead just preaching to my love about how it was eventually going to get old. A majority of this time my girlfriend worked 40 hours in the kitchen at a restaurant downtown (which was badass as a lady) and meanwhile I was putting in around 25 as a banquet server and this did not sit well with him, even though I made enough for rent and my immediate priorities. Eventually the stress and anxiety it was putting me through would have me leaving the house for no reason at all, driving aimlessly or sitting in my car for hours pretending to have more going on than I did because otherwise they (her brother and his fiance) would silent judge me for not maximizing my time to the capitalist definition, ""wasting time on a video games or watching basketball"". I'm somebody who has put a lot of time and effort into my spiritual and intellectual growth so this weighed a lot on my soul to be so heavily misunderstood, I want to be a positive, giving, light of a person and this feeling of being unequal because of my financials became too much to bear. I left. and me and my girlfriend grieved the situation recognizing me going back home and finishing my associates would be better for my longterm capabilities, and after getting in a car accident + losing my job; I really had no other choice. Eventually after being given the space, and succumbing to inadequacy of a long distance relationship she broke it off with me, and neither of us have been entirely whole again in the year thats followed. I've managed to successfully move out of my parents house again, and got that associates degree and now work a full time job where I relocated to. After that experience I'm in fear of dating, i've yet to meet the woman who shares mindset like mine against the stupidity of modern societies ""work to live"" problem. It makes me feel like I'll be forever alone, or forced to sacrifice myself. This is a great tragedy as someone who considers deep love the best life has to offer but I've been hurt in various long term relationships because of my lifestyle. Anyway the point of this post is I just want deep love again, I'm only 23 but meeting the right people just gets harder and harder, do any of you antiworkers relate to this struggle?",False,dw74mg,sadboibryce,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dw74mg/the_struggle_to_date_in_this_hellscape_we_call/,10,1

So I'm back at college, and am looking for some work to help pay the bills. I'm lucky in that I have enough financial runway from student loans to look for a job properly and be a bit selective. So I can avoid the worst managers and work environments.

She started by asking me how old I was, and then interrupted me when I was answering her second question. She also took a really rude tone. So after she asked my the third question, I said that I'm ending it because she asked me my age, interrupted me and was asking me ridiculous questions. 


She flipped out HARD. I got up and started walking out, telling her she needed to tell me where the exit was. She then threatened to call security to escort me out, and called me rude! It was so lolz, I told her that she can call security to escort me out as long as they show me the exit. 


She then started walking behind me and giving me directions to the exit because I wasn't going to stop walking LOL.

Today another employee and I put in 3 hours of back breaking work disassembling and reassembling shelves, moving mattresses that weigh up to 160 lbs. Shit that they ostensibly had months to do and is actually a better use of payroll than dicking around standing in an empty store. 
It’s not fully done but it’s a world better and needs maybe another 3 hours to actually be complete. These two dickheads just came upstairs to see what we did and literally just said what they would have done differently even though they both admitted that it was a ton of work and they wouldn’t have done it.

431,"Work Time, Live Time","Anti-Wage Labour piece from italian Left Communists.

"" The battle \[in which\] the proletariat has been engaged for a couple of centuries to shorten the duration of the working day is part of the historical heritage of all humanity. What today is normally considered a trade union claim among many is, in reality, one of the greatest achievements that our species will have to make. The future man will not be content to simply increase the so-called free time, but will eliminate from his own life those activities that most of the species have dedicated for millennia to a tiny fraction of themselves and, in the specific capitalist mode of production, exclusively to the enhancement of capital. Not only that, but also the equally inhuman one that man dedicates to the realization of this value, that is to the foolish consumption of goods of all kinds, will be eliminated. Therefore the elimination of work time, which today means unemployment, will be a conquest of the proletariat, not only for itself but for the whole human species.""

"" The objective prolongation of the working day has today different effects than in the past. It no longer occurs in a backward world where masses of men are torn from the earth and sent to the factory, where it is enough to increase the number of workers and make them work longer to increase surplus value; today the many hours of work are accompanied by the introduction of very modern and scientifically organized production processes, so an enormous amount of surplus value is obtained with double exploitation, absolute and relative (to produce longer and with machines and procedures that increase performance of work). The immediate result is that productive work is increasingly concentrated on a few individuals, while the rest of the population is dedicated to the useless work of immense social waste, or simply remains unemployed.

An increasingly high part of the world population is completely *superfluous* . And the adjective has nothing to do with chatter about demographic control: in this society overpopulation is ""relative"", that is, it is a surplus of humanity only in relation to the possibility of Capital to use labor power. The ratio between productive workers and unproductive mass is always given in percentage, never in absolute figures of living men on the earth's crust. The question of the balance between the number of men and the space existing on the Earth arises on our part according to completely different criteria than those of ecologists or followers of religions: it is not a problem of absolute number or even of the relationship between man on the one hand and nature on the other, but of a global vision that integrates man *and* nature in an inseparable whole, as indeed it has been for millions of years, and how it will still be with the use of greater future knowledge. Obviously every exponential growth, ecologists or not, is in contradiction, over time, with any man-nature harmony.""

"" In his book *The Woman and Socialism* , Bebel recalls the calculations of an Austrian economist of the nineteenth century, T. Hertzka, who in his book *The laws of social progress* , proceeds to a *""very exact research""* on what was the working energy necessary to maintain the population of Austria with the standard of living of the time. The method used is that of calculating large aggregates: average fertility is assumed for the entire cultivated countryside and sufficient food production is obtained by applying capital and labor-power to the land; an average productivity is assumed for the whole industry and the production necessary for the entire population is obtained, on which the work is distributed excluding women, children and the elderly. The result, which is certainly realistic for the data available at the time, is nevertheless surprising for those addicted to the capitalist propaganda of life dedicated to work: every valid man would have to work *an hour and a half a day* for 300 days a year.

Of course Hertzka, who is only a *""national economist""* , as Bebel says, and certainly not a communist, *""also takes into account the voluptuous needs of the most educated people""* , therefore he adds the production of luxury goods with the related employees, bringing the overall result at *two and a half hours a day* , for 750 hours a year. If we compare with the contractual 2,400 of our post-war period or with the current 1,900, we have the real measure of how increasingly the divinization of work in this society is increasingly aberrant, otherwise so unwilling to the divine and rather devoted to the trivial.

Today the calculation of Hertzka would take into account other parameters, given the general better organization of work, the socialization of production and the integration between the productive spheres due to the communications network, then almost irrelevant. Above all, it would take into account the fact that this is the era of major State interventions in the social field, for which a certain distribution of labor is already effective, although obviously based on criteria for safeguarding the production of surplus value and social cushioning.""

"" In France, the law of 35 hours has been in force since January of this year (it will be from January 2002 for companies with less than 20 employees), but the possibilities to apply a longer timetable are such that in practice this law works more than anything else as a regulation for overtime, but you only pay 10% more than ordinary hours. The law is completely generic, specifies nothing other than the field of application and tax relief for companies, leaving all specific legislation to bargaining between industry and trade unions. It is therefore not surprising that, even before final approval, there were many companies that applied the criteria of the law to come in advance, with 2,418,300 workers already subject to the 35-hour timetable, that is about 30% of all those who they worked in companies with more than 20 employees. It is even less surprising that the first practical effect of the law has been to make the exploitation of the workforce even more flexible through derogations from previous contracts.

In Germany there have been many reductions in local time, the most notable of which is that of Volkswagen, where the time was lowered to 28 hours a week, with a limited salary reduction, that is not proportional to the hours cut; many factories have adopted the 32 hours a week.

The figures show that it is one thing to launch a social plan for the generalized reduction in hours, another is to organize the latter within a factory. While the French labor minister states that the 35-hour law has produced 200,000 new jobs for now, Volkswagen claims to have saved about 30,000. As you can see, there is a noticeable disproportion: 200,000 out of about 26 million French workers (+ 0.76%) and 30,000 out of 250,000 workers in the automobile factory (+ 12%); this means that the mechanism of time reduction can be better controlled, with respect to the result, within the perimeter of an organized unit such as industry, which is able to scientifically plan the consequences, rather than in the whole capitalist society, by definition anarchic and unpredictable. But above all it means that the industry is able to reabsorb when it wants every reduction of time obtained in exchange for the free hand in terms of ""flexibility"".

434,"Retail jobs that are just vaguely ""associate"" or similar are horrible","You have to do ***everything*** in the store, minus specifically managerial duties. Man the registers, deal with abusive customers, answer the phone, dust shelves which is a whole process of having to remove items to wipe the shelf down, sweep, mop, clean the disgusting bathrooms, check for expired product, put shipment away, stock shelves, take out rancid heavy trash and destroy your back in the process since tall trash cans make it impossible to lift with your knees, make coffee, and now that it's cold: shovel snow, salt pavement. 

Then all the managers do is handle the daily profits, set up schedules (which for some reason takes hours to do), sit on the computer to order inventory when they don't even know what we have because they don't put weekly shipment away, email people, and of course call people in for maintenance since something seems to be broken every single day in this shit hole. 

How hard is it to hire people for specific duties? Why not hire people to handle inventory, people to handle registers, people to handle cleaning? Surely it would be way more productive, and easier to train people which we all know is a manager's biggest nightmare.

On top of all this, the fact you don't get a lunch break??? The fact you're considered ""part time"" so you get like no benefits even if you often work 40 hours a week???

451,Out-of-touch small business owners,"Recently I've been on the hunt for a full-time job in my field (because, you know, survival). 

I'd forgotten how much sycophancy and general ass-kissing is expected with the application process, and interviewing with managers.

Fortunately I've grown much wiser over the years and learned the red flags to avoid a potentially really bad job or manager.

Case in point: Without giving away too many details about myself -- The trade I've learned over the years is usually centered within small independently-run businesses. Unfortunately, I've met a lot of characters (not the fun kind) and small-business owners with a chip on their shoulder from the whole capitalist boot-strappin' mythology. *(""I built my own business and I made it! If this system doesn't work for you then you're a failure!"")*

Just a couple weeks ago, I went to interview at one of these small businesses. Everything seems to be going well until I ask questions about compensation. The owner only wants to pay $13/hr for this professional trade (and expects you to take on multiple other roles), does not offer health insurance, and does not ""BELIEVE"" in sick days because he's never needed them. Serious lack of empathy if you subscribe to that whole ""what's good for me, is good for thee!"" bullshit mentality.

Wtf reality does this guy live in where he thinks this is a great offer? Does he not realize you could probably work at Starbucks and make more money???

So yeah -- No thanks!!!! I'll go work at my local grocery chain that pays $15/hr and has full health insurance, sick days, and defined roles. I would rather do menial labor at a grocery store than be expected to ply my professional skillset for less than living wage!

454,I feel like a failure for not working even though I could/should,"Bit of a long post so bear with me. TL;DR at the bottom.

Over the past few months I've had a few jobs. I won't disclose the specifics, but they each varied greatly from one another (retail vs organizing, different hours/schedule structures, etc). After a short amount of time with each-- not even long enough to finish training, mostly-- I found myself completely devoid of purpose and in physical pain while working or at the prospect of work. I *could* do these jobs, and I absolutely needed the money, but every day that went by when I had a job and knew that I'd have to go back in at some point was literally making me suicidal again. I've been on antidepressants for years and it feels like I went cold turkey. Because of my current living situation and the available job market, I've been able to quit these jobs, but obviously it's had serious repercussions. A few week's work doesn't look good on my resume and about 20% of my paycheck goes to taxes meant to be deducted over the course of a year, assuming I would've been at the job long enough to not see a difference. I'm so, so happy jobless and never want to go back to work because of how it makes me feel. I don't have that option, though. I need money to support myself and my fiancé. Both of my parents are compulsive spenders and I've spent a lifetime working on unlearning that (some progress, not all). I have essentially nothing to my name and no initiative to continue to work in light of my health, but I have every *reason* to work due to my circumstances. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR -- I can hold a job, I just don't. I quit work as often as I pick it up because I can't deal with the mental and physical burden it takes on me, regardless of what type of job it is or the freedoms it has.

First off, could dude have stabbed me BEFORE my ten hour shift? Noooo. Wait till he's all tired and not paying attention to try and murder him. 

Anyways, so I'm walkin home and I cross the street and I thought this dude just shoved me. Bastard made me drop my soda. Turns out he was stabbing me. He got two good jabs in, one to the middle of my back (which was fun to experience heal) and one to my side. Then I watch him stab me in the stomach, at which point I now know I brought dick to a knife fight. So I go to block his fouth blow and knock the knife out of his hand. It split open my elbow and I got a good look at this 3 inch folding knife with my fucking blood all over it. I'm pissed. We scramble for the it but he got to it first. So I stand up, pissing blood and look him in the eyes. Some latino kid shitting himself like he's staring at a zombie. We scream at eachother, he fucks off and I walk my ass home. The cops show up and do sweet fuck all. I go to the hospital, they keep me there two days and send me home with bandages tell me to stay out of trouble. Ha. Haha.

So I'm back home, stressing out over weather dude is gunna come back and try to finish the job. I take some time off work and my bosses are like ""Hey, we're glad you're okay, take some pto, get better kiddo."" Cool right? I took a week off and they gave me like a third of what I normally get paid. So my mom says since my sister is dropping out of college, I should help her move and come with her to my home town where it's safe. Cool, safety, I gotta help my sister pack but hey, I'm wounded, no heavy lifting for me. Wrong, she's rude and makes me pay for my own food and makes me move all her stuff from her apartment to the car. I gored my stomach wound on some novelty moose antlers she drags around and it reopened the wound. Fun. So on that trip I decide to quit my job, which I was an axe throwing coach at an arcade. Which was frankly a dream job and I was happy for the first time in my adult life. So I get back home and a buddy says he can hook me up with a job. Disposing of fucking medical waste. Sharps to be exact. Thanks. I saw some gnarly shit there, my clothes and body reeked of what I assume Hell smells like on a hot day. Or the Hamptons in January. So I could only take a couple months of that before I quit. So now I'm unemployed again, depressed, anxious. I've never had ptsd before. And I don't see any hope of a future.

Since childhood I have always been artistically minded, loving to sing and dance and write and express myself however I could. I have maintained that mindset to this day, though with college I rarely take the time to hone my skills. 

And I have known since I was a teenager that I never ever ever ever wanted an “office job”, “cubicle job”, “9 to 5” deal, whatever you want to call it. I have said aloud many times that I’d rather be a waitress who works on music in her spare time or even homeless than work a desk job. 

My parents set me up from the beginning that being “successful” was the most important thing in the world and that is what they want from/for me. But their idea of success is quite different from mine. They’re less strict than the typical parents you’d think of, but still prioritized my grades and “success” in classes over everything, while hypocritically at the same time trying to tell me to pursue my singing and writing interests. 

I have dreams of being a singer, making albums and touring and sharing my music with the world. On top of that I have dreams of writing novels and TV scripts and movie scripts and sharing those with the world too. 

But guess what? My major is Russian. Yes, Russian. The language. I do like it a lot and am good at it but it has literally nothing to do with my true dreams. I have literally no intention of getting a job in the translator/government whatever the fuck Russian field. I will not do it. I blatantly refuse, because it’s not what I want.

No one besides me knows this, but since perusing this sub and seeing how miserable it is to be stuck in this work-all-day system, I have decided I am going to join a commune after graduation. I spent a lot of time yesterday going through many in several states and have bookmarked a few I’m interested in for further research. I will do whatever it takes to join one of these and contribute to a community whose goals aren’t productivity and profit but rather reconnecting with nature and the natural world around us, with other human beings, taking time to actually breathe and go outside for once in a damn while. It might sound hippy dippy but to me it also sounds like a dream come true. 

I see myself living on this commune, doing physical labor in exchange for my shelter and just enjoying the sunshine and I have no problem with that. And I’m a tiny physically weak girl who’s lived in the suburbs nearly her whole life! *Still* I’d rather work on a farm with other individuals than work a desk job. That’s how terrified and disgusted I am with the work culture we have.

I don’t want my life to end up a dead end before it even starts. I see myself living on a commune for maybe about a year, working on the land and then coming inside to write/sing/make instrumentals/cook/clean/maybe even paint or draw even though I’m not very experienced with it. No morning alarms. No commute. No fluorescent lighting replacing sunshine. No meaningless slog. Whenever I get bored I can just pick up another hobby/interest or go out to the field and work some more. Is it going to be utopia? Of course not, I don’t expect my life to suddenly become perfect. But is it much better than any alternative I can think of? Absolutely. 

Here is the site I used to look up communes: https://www.ic.org

I see a lot of people saying they wish they could just pack up one day and leave and I think one way to do that would be to join a commune. Easier said than done of course but there are so many options out there and ways to earn money on the commune by working on the farm/land or doing other tasks. If anyone reading this finds the idea of joining commune interesting, take some time to go on this site and research ones in your state or even in a state you’d like to live in. The site splits up the communes by many many factors so you can narrow your choices down by a lot. Keep in mind there are some communes that require membership fees and monthly fees to keep things running so if you’re seriously considering this make sure you can scrape together the money if necessary (I myself have to figure out how I’m going to do that as well). 

Maybe I’m just a naive kid but having these communes bookmarked gives me some sense of hope that I don’t have to run my life into the ground and I can take my time for myself and do whatever the hell I want instead of joining the traditional workforce the second I’m hot off the college graduation press. I can’t see many downsides to joining just for a year or two or even a few months and again maybe that’s just my dreams clouding my judgment but I still think it’s worth some consideration. Hope this helps some of you.

465,I paid out my mortgage loan,"Hello everyone.

Today I paid out my mortgage loan - I had some money so it took me only 6 months.

I bought old, ugly fucking apartment and now I have to spend much money for reparation. 

Already hate it. I regret buying that apartment. 

Anyway, first stage on of my plan is done 

1. buy apartment
2. make reparation (3000-5000$)
3. buy small house in some village - the price in my country is only 3-5 thousands for a normal house.
4. rent out apartment (200$ per month)
5. live in my house in village. 

Fucking hell, I want to die anyway. I didn't feel anything when I paid out my loan. I thought I will be happy or something like that. 

I am so tired. And yeah, I am 25 yers old, I already have an apartment, I have very high salary but still I hate every day of my life. It's because of work and the slave system I live in, and constant anxiety.

I can't even relax. Hate booze, and when I smoke weed life seems so awful, I feel something like existential horror and just want to sleep forever and don't worry about anything anymore.",False,dvxq73,s1lav3,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dvxq73/i_paid_out_my_mortgage_loan/,4,1

His parents now live back in the country they came from and he just works 15-20 hours per week at a grocery store to buy himself food and pay the internet/electric bill. He is the happiest guy i know because he doesnt have to worry about work or waste his time. His parents pay the propertytaxes on the house aswell and he drives a paid off 2013 Honda Accord which will last forever. I hung out with him on sunday after i got done waging and i envy him so so much. Everyday he goes hiking and fishing. He tends to his flower/veggie and fruit garden in the evening and reads books in his hammock. I had to ask him if he is ok with not having a “good” job and he said “yes, i dont want to work fulltime, i dont have much to worry about” I work 40-55 hours per week, make alot more money than him, have 2 nice cars yet i am depressed because im a wagie. My friend has so much time on his hands that he started a vineyard and learning to woodwork. I know this isnt a common occurance but man is it a nice one. Something i also noticed about him is he just looks healthier than most people i know.. his skin is perfect, hairline is perfect and hair is thick. i believe this is due to 0 stress.

I'm tired of people not being able to conceptualize a life with less working hours. ""What would anyone do with all that free time?"" Just because you let your passions and interests die and have become comfortable watching television for the entirety of your free time doesn't mean there aren't people out there who would use the much needed free time to participate in their hobbies/interests, try new experiences and make memories with the people they care about. 

I'm tired of that fake ass, boot licking, mind numbing, soul destroying, office and corporate culture.

I'm tired of people prioritizing money over humanity and not seeing the bigger picture in life.

By killing off a third of Europe, the black death acted as a supply shock to the labor market, driving wages up so high the state stepped in to preserve the feudal pyramid.

So about two weeks ago I woke up at 7am to my dog deathly ill. I texted my boss (at around 8am) saying my dog was most likely dying and that I probably wouldn't make it on time for my 10:30am shift. She said it was fine and she would go in for me for a bit. We did end up having to put my dog down, and when I asked my boss if I could have the rest of the day off to grieve with my family, she said I had to go in. I showed up to work and was a completely mess. I was sobbing on and off and I almost walked out then and there. My boss was sort of sympathetic but I was furious over the fact that I had to go in after my best friend of 11 years literally died an hour before I went to work.

shoulder that aches sometimes from straining it
picking up a too-heavy tray. I've still picked up side
figs between jobs in the past, or just wanting some
extra pocket money. Of nothing else, it's a covering

On average I'm still only getting 26 hours a week which isn't livable. She was supposed to train me and show me how to get referrals for this company which is a medical company btw, but she hasn't. Now she's avoiding me, having the weekly staff meetings I usually take notes for her at and make her powerpoints for in secret, and literally JUST told me two days ago that I have 6 (six) weeks to pull in 8 referrals for the company of the department I work in or the department will close and not only will I lose my job altogether, but all the animals being fostered by the department I work for will go back to the shelter and they are all at risk of euthanasia. I feel as though she set me up to fail. She gave me a project with no tools. What do I do? How do I deal with this?

Boomers want to hoard wealth and housing? Let em have it, their time is almost up. They say we whine, are lazy, and need to pick up life by the bootstraps? Lets prove them right. Who are we fighting to impress? A bunch of people who can't recognize us for our talent and hard work? We're forced to work so someone can live out their dreams and live in luxury. 

But we have one thing they don't have and that's time and youth. Why waste it on a bunch of ungrateful pricks who keep trying to whip us to work harder and faster with no compensation? 

Something tells me things would change real quick if we all simply stopped participating. Why destroy our physical and mental health for someone elses benefit? The longer I spend the more I realize how the old prey on the young. They hoard their wealth and brainwash us into thinking we need to buy all of their products and services and buildllshit material.

I am going to give a challenge to all of Reddit for this one;  we have this woman who is rightfully facing 20 years in prison that was caught grooming victims for her husband.  Her name is Lori Wilson as her husband was violating minors in ways I don't even want to imagine.   So I am inviting those who are reading this to do that piece that chronicles the saga from 2017 to 2019 from the five sources that were being pulled up.  One of them was from the Department of Justice,and the invitation is to come to [Draft2Digital.com](https://Draft2Digital.com) and this is the court reporter challenge.  The members must have their own [PayPal.me](https://PayPal.me) account to get paid and I will offer up The Ethereal Gazette: Issue Five to the best entry of this nature as I will personally format the ePub3 for publication to publish on the site with fonts that will give this an approach in print.

This suggestion is to not put money in the criminals pocket for something they did but in the pocket of those who are chronicling her sentence up to the arrests and the aftermath of the crime.  I found out her husband is using a Chicago phone number to lure his victims.   I want to make sure the best entry is sent to WGN and be factual as possible. The word counts with this keep it between 5600-8700 words with the report something to keep fair with the royalty being a $1 per eBook and I will provide the pictures from the findings to use with this.  I am providing the link to [one of the articles](https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/internet-fortune-tellers-from-georgia-indicted-child-sex-tampering-charges/) and someone did a mobile screen shot of the said article too as I am going to snag the picture from the article as seen on the laptop -- those who want to give us a hand to make sure they both are not getting out; the one is looking at a long sentence as long as a convicted murderer.   Almost as long as Billy Porras when he murdered a cab driver at age 19. 

This was one of the sources of the said news story if one is looking.  It was backed up by the Department of Justice this time all the screen caps are included as the one who was updating her actual public page is in fact her husband.   Lori Wilson, 34, operates as Loretta Lightningbolt as some of my circle have mutual with her so this that I am inviting the community to do is give those who are learning about this a hand.  They were both charged on Federal charges with this and the Federal Press release is linked to the said article.

&amp;#x200B;

[from her husband's facebook page](https://preview.redd.it/7lk1z7xiodz31.jpg?width=560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac79ffb8562b7b43e165224842f9da118a95b488)

From the [Department of Justice Report](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/man-indicted-coercing-minors-sex-wife-accused-trying-persuade-victim-recant), and I quote, ""Lori Wilson, the indictment states, attempted to persuade the victim that the minor’s experiences were “psychic visions” or “dreams” in an effort “to prevent truthful communication of information relating to the possible commission of a federal offense to agents of the Army Criminal Investigation Division.”  

Facebook commenting had invited a mob rule over all her presences and her husband presence too instead of doing that let law enforcement do their job and grab up the word processor to report on the findings,  if those who were friends of both indited -- I am encouraging them to come forward and relate their knowledge of what happened though make sure the arrested two do not see a dime of their ill-gotten fame.

One of the comments,  ""It's the FBI and the ARMY. How off can they be? When there's 10 counts it's not guesswork."" 

That is one of the cleaner comments in the tier as there's more than one hat-tip on the news story breaking,  we're going to focus this on Lori Wilson as some are focusing on her husband.   One you don't try to convince those who are violated to not say they weren't with the power of suggestion.  

Another comment reads,  ""Y'all need to look at when comments are posted most of these that are being replied to are from 6-7 weeks ago. (Her husband has been arrested which is why there’s no activity on this page.)""

Some of these are proof-read for the presentation an those who are looking at this, there is some to work with and work from with your pieces -- WGN has yet to catch wind of this and seems like the news story stayed concentrated in Savannah and Altanta, Georgia,  though let's see if we can make this international.",False,dxyo5s,illinoishorrorman,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dxyo5s/criminal_begging_via_paypal_for_bail_money/,0,1

These naps range anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half and I stay clocked in the entire time. Its pretty awesome. Sometimes I'll go somewhere scenic like a park and just nap there.

539,Secret Santa 🤦,"The basic concept of the Secret Santa game is simple. All of the participants' names are placed into a hat, box, etc. and mixed up. ... When the gift-giving time arrives, each recipient finds his/her gift and must guess who their Secret Santa is. If they can't guess, their Secret Santa eventually confesses. 

I can't be the only one that FUCKING hates hearing this around this time of the year. I find it so awkward, pointless and a waste of money.
The reasons why I hate this so much:

1- I have only recently joined a new team in my workplace as I am pretty shy, I find it really hard to just have boring office conversations with the people on my team they are all really friendly with eachother and have a number of inside jokes so they can find it really easy to buy a gift for the people they get matched with. 

2 - A waste of money. This year we have been told that the minimum spend is £15. I did suggest that because there are new people that have joined the team maybe we could write down a few things we would like to make it easier. The reply I got was 'no that takes away the fun' ok. Also, £15 is quite a lot of money to be spending on someone you don't really know? 

3-  Its fucking awkward. I don't know about you but I feel awkward opening gifts infront of the people I actually know and care about. Imagine all sitting around opening gifts off people you barely talk to and thinking about something to say without having a panic attack and running out crying. We did get asked if we didn't wanna participate but everyone was willing. I feel like if I'd say no. I would just end up getting bitched about making the office week even more UNBEARABLE.

4 - I feel bad for whoever has me. I feel bad that somebody has to use their free time to think about getting me a gift when all I really ever say is good morning and goodbye lol. All I wanna do is come in do the work (not) and get my shitty payslip at the end of the month. Idgaf about a gift really.

Here's the thing, I love Christmas it's probably my favourite time of the year because for once people actually seem happy and the workplace environment actually loosens up a bit. I guess it's just another shitty way of people trying to make you think that work is actually fun.

546,There was an active shooter threat at my work today,"I'm not endorsing the person who made the threat against my boss / workplace today. Obviously, someone who has been through this abusive system we call ""work"" should never resort to violence against bosses or co-workers.

However, my boss is the ultimate asshole who brought this upon himself. He also handled it in the most despicable way possible. People handed in their resignations during a ""security meeting"" we had wherein we were all ordered to follow specific protocols (designed to keep him safe, not us, in my opinion). Every suggestion made by employees, including one ex-special forces guy who was shot in the chest in Iraq, were promptly dismissed by my boss. He stood up, and walked out, as did many people during the meeting. Asshole bosses know better than ex-military, I guess?

It all started when HR hired a janitor at a specific rate of pay (\~15/hr) and my boss had the audacity to lower the rate of pay, during the janitor's first month of work, down to minimum wage. The janitor walked out, and did not return the keys. They had been arguing over the phone about ""returning property"", and the cops were called on the janitor. Then the building was re-keyed completely. After that, the janitor filled out ""contact the president"" form and made a threat saying he will shoot my boss. Then the cops were called on the janitor again.

In my 4 years here, we have been through:

* 5 HR directors
* 5 Finance Directors
* 30 million USD lost due to a guy quitting (who knew how everything worked). I think they were paying him under 50k. My boss finally saw the value in him, and rehired him for only 20k more than he was making before.
* At least 100 employees who have walked out, been terminated, or been automated. Our company size is only 300.

I work as a postman so I am often working alongside one other person for the whole week as we share a van. Most weeks I can work with some pretty chill people and we can have a chilled week. Then there’s some uptight wankers that make me feel on edge the whole damn week. I’m pretty lazy and don’t often take initiative and this can result in them getting pissy with me. 

I’m just fed up with it. We’re both in the same boat here in capitalist society just trying to make ends meet. I suppose they’re subconsciously angry about the way the system is and find other people to blame for their shit lives I don’t know.

567,I hate how work has turned me into such a dishonest person.,"I’ve been reflecting lately on how goddamn often I lie in workplace settings, when I almost never do in my personal life.

I’m a grad school student, and I work two jobs (one is a main job and the other is a side gig). I have so many examples. I can’t just say “I need a personal day” or, “I really need to finish some important schoolwork/study” and take the day off. I’ll end up lying that I’m out of town, working my other job, I’m sick, etc. I can’t even count how many times over the last 5 or so years I’ve said I’m sick when I’ve been perfectly fine, just because I genuinely needed a day off for whatever reason. I often work 8-7, and obviously, a lot of places (including doctor’s offices) aren’t open before or after this. Once again, I often need to lie to get a standard checkup or get ongoing treatment for my chronic psoriasis (most employers don’t see either of these as important whatsoever, but if my psoriasis gets bad enough, I don't want to leave my house).

I’ve also lied about my availability a lot, because if I didn’t, my main job would overwork me into the ground (with no overtime of course!), and my grades would suffer accordingly.

And then of course there’s the lying I do on the clock. I have to be fake AF and put on a thick mask when dealing with some parents at my main job (I work with kids/in schools) who are often neurotic, rude, unappreciative, and entitled in the extreme. I actively and greatly dislike one of the mothers of the kids I work with and it kills my soul to strap on an artificial smile and cater to her ridiculous demands like they’re legit, when I think she’s genuinely a crappy person (she’s awful to me, awful to school staff, and awful to, most importantly, her son). The director of the company I work for is all about the money and doesn’t give a shit about the kids’ well-being. Every time she informs me of a choice she’s made that’s clearly motivated by money and somehow screws the kids, I have to pretend like I’m fine with it when I’m goddamn screaming inside. I do everything in my power to help the kids I work with, but my power is so limited. It’s exhausting. I’ve realized the reason why I’ve gotten so much “better” at jobs over the years is because I’ve essentially become an absolute expert actress/bullshitter. If there’s anything genuinely or “me” on the clock, it’s when I’m one-on-one with the kids. They’re the only ones who get anything real or good. Otherwise, I play an incredibly artificial role and I play it well. And I’m not proud of that. I’m absolutely ashamed.

The worst part is that it’s inescapable. Every job where you’re not the boss/owner requires this superficiality and sacrificing of one’s true self. How people do this happily/willingly will never make sense to me. But at least I have this sub, where I know I’m not alone in these kinds of feelings and have an outlet.

Employers should have to pay an hourly rate and all transport fares for interviewees, it'd certainly stop them asking 50 people to show up if they were the ones footing the bill.

579,Excerpt from The Jungle by Upton Sinclair,"And then turn over the page with me, and gaze upon the other side of the picture. There are a thousand--ten thousand, maybe--who are the masters of these slaves, who own their toil. They do nothing to earn what they receive, they do not even have to ask for it--it comes to them of itself, their only care is to dispose of it. They live in palaces, they riot in luxury and extravagance--such as no words can describe, as makes the imagination reel and stagger, makes the soul grow sick and faint. They spend hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a garter; they spend millions for horses and automobiles and yachts, for palaces and banquets, for little shiny stones with which to deck their bodies. Their life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in ostentation and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary things, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their fellow creatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat and tears and blood of the human race! It is all theirs--it comes to them; just as all the springs pour into streamlets, and the streamlets into rivers, and the rivers into the oceans--so, automatically and inevitably, all the wealth of society comes to them. The farmer tills the soil, the miner digs in the earth, the weaver tends the loom, the mason carves the stone; the clever man invents, the shrewd man directs, the wise man studies, the inspired man sings--and all the result, the products of the labor of brain and muscle, are gathered into one stupendous stream and poured into their laps! The whole of society is in their grip, the whole labor of the world lies at their mercy--and like fierce wolves they rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they devour and tear! The whole power of mankind belongs to them, forever and beyond recall--do what it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for them and dies for them! They own not merely the labor of society, they have bought the governments; and everywhere they use their raped and stolen power to intrench themselves in their privileges, to dig wider and deeper the channels through which the river of profits flows to them!

The thing is, even with my wage I can barely afford to live in the cheapest flats within any reasonable distance from my work, I work as a junior software dev and the work is not only boring but its for very old and outdated software that is likely to leave me without any marketable skills.

Im 27 now, and I want to be self employeed making video games (which is a notoriously hard way to earn a living but its my passion). 

So im starting to think that I should move back home as i can live there pretty much for free and still get to work (so at least i'll have some savings), but the commute is an hour longer (each way), and im already finding at the end of the day im to exhusted mentally to want to put time into my passion, making my video game (or doing any of my increasing amount of interests i want to explore).

607,Follow Your Bliss,"JOSEPH CAMPBELL: When you are a child, when you are young and a young person, you are a camel. The camel gets down on its knees and says, “Put a load on me.” This is obedience. This is receiving the instruction, information that your society knows you must have in order to live a competent life. When the camel is well loaded, he gets up on his feet, struggles to his feet, and runs out into the desert, where he becomes transformed into a lion. The heavier the load, the more powerful the lion. The function of the lion is to kill a dragon, and the name of the dragon is “Thou Shalt.” And on every scale of the dragon there is a “Thou Shalt” imprinted. Some of it comes from 2,000 years, 4,000 years ago. Some of it comes from yesterday morning’s newspaper headline. When the dragon is killed, the lion is transformed into a child, an innocent child living out of its own dynamic. And Nietzsche uses the term, ein aus sich rollendes Rad, a wheel rolling out of its own center. That’s what you become. That is the mature individual.

The “Thou Shalt” is the civilizing force, it turns a human animal into a civilized human being. But the one who has thrown off the “Thou Shalts” is still a civilized human being. Do you see? He has been humanized, you might say, by the “Thou Shalt” system, so his performance now as a child is not simply childlike at all. He has assimilated the culture and thrown it off as a “Thou Shalt.” But this is the way in any art work. You go to work and study an art. You study the techniques, you study all the rules, and the rules are put upon you by a teacher. Then there comes a time of using the rules, not being used by them. Do you understand what I’m saying? And one way is to follow…and I always tell my students, follow your bliss.

BILL MOYERS: Follow your bliss?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Your bliss, where the deep of sense of being in form and going where your body and soul want to go, when you have that feeling, then stay with it and don’t let anyone throw you off. Have you ever read Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt?

BILL MOYERS: Not in a long time.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Do you remember the last line? “I’ve never done a thing I wanted to in all my life.”

BILL MOYERS: Quite an admission.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: That’s the man who never followed his bliss. Well, I heard that line. I was living in Bronxville when I was teaching at Sarah Lawrence. Before I was married, I used to be eating out in the restaurants of the town for my lunch and dinners. And Thursday night was the maid’s night off in Bronxville, so that all the families were out in the restaurants. And one fine evening, I was in my favorite restaurant there. It was a Greek restaurant. And at a table was sitting a father, a mother, and a scrawny little boy here, about 12 years old. And the father says to the boy, “Drink your orange drink your tomato juice.” And the boy says, “I don’t want to.” And the father with a louder voice says, “Drink your tomato juice.” And the mother says, “Don’t make him do what he doesn’t want to do.” The father looks at her, and he says, “He can’t go through life doing what he wants to do.” Said, “If he does only what he wants to do, he’ll be dead. Look at me, I’ve never done a thing I wanted to in all my life.” I said, My God, Babbitt incarnate. And that’s the man who never followed his bliss.

Well, you may have a success in life, but then just think of it, what kind of life was it, what good is it? You’ve never done a thing you wanted to in all your life.

609,Excerpt from The Jungle,"All this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow hanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the pathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet could not help approaching the place. There are all stages of being out of work in Packingtown, and he faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest. There is a place that waits for the lowest man--the fertilizer plant!

The men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers. Not more than one in ten had ever really tried it; the other nine had contented themselves with hearsay evidence and a peep through the door. There were some things worse than even starving to death. They would ask Jurgis if he had worked there yet, and if he meant to; and Jurgis would debate the matter with himself. As poor as they were, and making all the sacrifices that they were, would he dare to refuse any sort of work that was offered to him, be it as horrible as ever it could? Would he dare to go home and eat bread that had been earned by Ona, weak and complaining as she was, knowing that he had been given a chance, and had not had the nerve to take it?--And yet he might argue that way with himself all day, and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send him away again shuddering. He was a man, and he would do his duty; he went and made application--but surely he was not also required to hope for success!

The fertilizer works of Durham's lay away from the rest of the plant. Few visitors ever saw them, and the few who did would come out looking like Dante, of whom the peasants declared that he had been into hell. To this part of the yards came all the ""tankage"" and the waste products of all sorts; here they dried out the bones,--and in suffocating cellars where the daylight never came you might see men and women and children bending over whirling machines and sawing bits of bone into all sorts of shapes, breathing their lungs full of the fine dust, and doomed to die, every one of them, within a certain definite time. Here they made the blood into albumen, and made other foul-smelling things into things still more foul-smelling. In the corridors and caverns where it was done you might lose yourself as in the great caves of Kentucky. In the dust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off twinkling stars--red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the color of the mist and the brew from which it came. For the odors of these ghastly charnel houses there may be words in Lithuanian, but there are none in English. The person entering would have to summon his courage as for a cold-water plunge. He would go in like a man swimming under water; he would put his handkerchief over his face, and begin to cough and choke; and then, if he were still obstinate, he would find his head beginning to ring, and the veins in his forehead to throb, until finally he would be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia fumes, and would turn and run for his life, and come out half-dazed.

625,"Is anyone here voluntarily long-term (even life-long!) unemployed, and on benefits?","So this isn't something most people talk about much... In fact I've not met anyone who admits to this.

I'm basically voluntarily unemployed and on benefits, and have been most of my life. 

How rare is this? I've not met anyone who is employable (well I find it easy to get interviews and get hired, but not to stay in jobs), intelligent, free from major health conditions (apart from autism) but yet who doesn't want to work.

Im a 35 year old Oxbridge graduate so I'm pretty smart but I've only worked for a few years out of the 13 since I graduated. The majority of that time, circa 10 years, I've been claiming unemployment benefits. It's not very hard, in the UK at least, to 'play the system'.

I've worked in low paid customer service and administration jobs (as well as a week in a warehouse). These jobs are obviously routine and beneath my intelligence level, plus I get fired regularly because of autism-related social faux pas. The only job I found meaningful/motivating was working in customer service in a healthcare related field (there were elderly people in care homes who benefited from my doing my job well essentially). Mostly, I can't work in these worthy fields bcos of a criminal record.

So generally I have opted out of the world of work. I enjoy my life of physical and cultural activities, I'm never bored, and I'm involved a lot in environmental activism.",False,du0mq1,JayMercutio,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/du0mq1/is_anyone_here_voluntarily_longterm_even_lifelong/,23,1
626,Got Fired Today,"I’ve been pursuing work through freelance means and with other companies. My boss and I don’t really work that well together and I wanted to take things a different direction in my career. We are only a two person company. 

Today, I came in to work, did about two hours of work, he asked me to teach him a technique that I pioneered for the company and then asked me to sit down and do a six month review. We did the review and then he revealed that people told him I’d been interviewing at other companies and approaching companies (potential clients that I never worked with with him) about doing work. He took me on this two hour journey explaining that I seemed like I was one foot out the door and he wanted someone who was loyal. He also said it seemed like I was “just there to take his money” and that he’d put a lot of cash into purchasing new equipment for the company just for me (which is true cause he bought a computer so I could do my work in the office but that’s his computer. He also bought a new camera but that was after months of me using my personal camera and the new camera has greatly improved our quality). 

So I’m out of a job. Hopefully I get a job from a company I interviewed at or can make a living on freelance. A great deal of my personal equipment is still at the office and I have to figure out how to get it back. 

So remember kids. Even when you’ve been hired to do a job and sell your labor with a smile, you’re really just taking some dude’s money.",False,dv2la6,jludey,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dv2la6/got_fired_today/,23,1

646,What's the worst job you've ever had and why?,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here goes.

I'll start. I managed to land a job earlier this year and was impressed that I even managed to get a job to begin with after having spent 2 years trying to get one. The job sounded pretty decent. *I get to maintain this small company's social media accounts and online presence as well as making them have a better rep. Cool!*

But boy was I wrong. I had *some* experience with interviews (since I went to university interviews and assumed that they were more or less the same as job interviews but for different situations), but the interview I had for this job wasn't what I expected since they pretty much told me about the job rather than asking questions. The boss didn't seem interested in me at all.

Anyway, I somehow managed to get the job and was eager to start since I was *finally* able to get some sort of income as well as getting the all important work experience. It started off okay. I got some training on how to use some software and quickly got the hang of it. That's when it started to go downhill. That was the only ""training"" I got; being trained in something so stupidly easy like learning how to use new software for the first time. Since it was my first job, I wasn't sure if it was normal to get trained on one thing each month, so I stuck with it. I mastered that aspect and got bored quickly (idk if it's because I have ADHD or because of how companies work in general), so I asked to get training in other areas, only for the guy training me to sarcastically and bluntly say ""it's a workplace, not school"".

So I spend the next couple of weeks doing nothing but mindlessly uploading content to their crappy website using that software I was ""trained"" to use, trying to avoid doing it but also not getting caught for slacking at the same time. I ask time and time again if I can get trained in other areas, but the guy who trained me (or was *supposed* to but didn't want to) claims to be extremely busy, which I kind of understood since it was a small business of about 10 people.

Fast forward to mid August, my boss reappears after mysteriously going away on holiday to another country for about a month and tells me my performance was bad, even though I asked to be trained in things other than uploading things to their site all day long. I get ignored and I get told that I'm underperforming although I did every task that was set. During my time at that (*awful*) place, I was encouraged to ask for help, so therefore I did, only for the guy who was supposed to train me to say that I needed to understand things better despite the fact that they gave me vague and unclear instructions to begin with (and this is why I'm reluctant to ask for help).

All of this *just* to work full time (I worked about 30-35 hours a week) and be paid a measly £3.90 an hour (it was an apprenticeship with a legitimate provider and training was due to start in September), not to mention that *they* cut my hours (first they took off half an hour each day which meant I worked 6.5 hours rather than 7, then they did the same again, which meant I worked 6 hours each day) and reduced my wage from £4.60/hr to £3.90/hr during my first week there for no reason at all. I lasted 6 weeks there (got sacked in the end, but I'm glad to be out of there since I managed to get to go to university instead) and that was pretty much my summer down the drain, but hey at least I got work experience and money (although I've pretty much spent it all on places where I've *had* to spend money (i.e. food, rent etc)).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I worked 30-35 hours a week for just over a month this past summer for below the minimum wage (they told me it was an apprenticeship and that training was due to start in September) doing nothing but uploading items to a small company's website and getting sacked for poor performance although I did the best I could.

653,Year 11 in the teaching profession. Just some thoughts.,"How school creates workers: School WAS created to produce workers. The bells that signal class changes were put in place to help children get accustomed to the bells that signaled break or shift changes in factories and other industrial settings. I've taught in three countries and only one (Korea) didn't come out and say that our job is to ""produce taxpayers"" (and Korea may well have if I wasn't just their Guest English Teacher). We claim to teach critical thinking when what we mostly do is socialize them to comply with authority. As the ""authority"" in my room, I choose to be honest with them in that we're all in the same boat. We all have to be here (I have to be here because my husband and I both have severe illnesses and live in a heartless country that requires that at least one of us works for health insurance) and they have to attend school until they are 18 by law, or lose their drivers license in a rural state with 0 transit (which means no independence, etc). 

I'm in a posiiton to help students think about how things are and how they can be. We read a lot of Orwell. But last March I started having seizures. I've had 3 in less than 6 months and got news a couple of days ago that my eeg is abnormal, so it seems it's something I will always have to deal with. My most recent seizure occured at school, during school, yet I was left by myself to roam the building and parking lot alone for nearly 2 hours until a police officer found me and called an ambulance. The 400 dollar bill for that 15 minute ride is sitting on my coffee table, and I do not plan to pay it. 

""SELF CARE IS THE ANSWER"": Nope. This is another aspect of Capitalism. Let's make people miserable to the point that they think the only thing that will help them is to consume our products and media. I have been given a written warning about my absences, in spite of the fact that they were all related to either my or my husband's well documented medical issues. (Edit: Forgot to finish this thought. Missing this work means we are out of paid leave and we don't have money or time for SELF CARE.)

Can a job kill you?: I guess I'm going to find out. I thought it was just the school, the district, the state. Don't get me wrong, they all suck beyond understanding, but places I applied to (Vegas, Nashville, a few others) paid more but the Clark County School District (where Vegas is) went on strike the first week of school, so it's hard to imagine myself doing this job in a non shitty environment. I am desperately looking for other work... online teaching, higher ed, etc. People with Education degrees are downright fucked since nobody really wants to consider us for anything outside of our field. I've considered going back to school for a medical billing and coding certificate, but I don't know. It is probably my best bet, particularly since my goal is to someday work from home, but I have 0 savings and would have to somehow obtain additional student loans to complete the program. 

On life: I feel 30 years older than I am. My marriage has suffered. My relationships with family and friends has suffered. I can't afford a vacation; I can barely afford a night out, and even if I could, my husband's coping mechanism gets in the way (heavy drinking). 

If I had a chance to do it all over again, well, it's hard to say in a world that is ran by Capitalism. Ideally we would have a basic income and universal healthcare, and I would go back to my loves of writing and singing. I would have the chance to spend more time with my family and help my ailing mother and husband. I could get the treatment I need to have a child, or be able to adopt a child without thousands of dollars. 

But for now, here I am. I'm just sad and tired and wanted to get some stuff out, and I figured you guys would get it. Sorry that it's long, and thanks to anyone who read. I hope everyone has as good a day as they can in this capitalist hellhole.",False,dszq5b,sbwv09,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dszq5b/year_11_in_the_teaching_profession_just_some/,12,2

Of course I would love to not work sometimes but it seems like it would get old quick. I hardly have money to go out and do fun things or follow passions now. I doubt I would be loaded with money to do what I want if we had universal income. Usually when I’m not working I watch tv play video games go hiking and spend time with my wife. If that was my whole life though it seems unfulfilling. I get a sense of accomplishment from my job and it can be rewarding even tho getting out of bed on Monday morning sucks.

“K boomed” is not of in the
workplace

Dear Rachel,

With the widespread attention of the phrase “ok boomed’,
many sincerely (and for employers, dangerously) do not
appreciate the potential against interpretation of the term.
The Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act
(ADEA) protects workers over the age of 40 — a category
that includes all “borders” — from discrimination or
harassment on the basis of age. ""Is the phrase enters our
vocabulary, the use of “ok boomed” in the workplace could
be sufficient evidence of age-based hostility to support a
lawsuit under the ADEA,"" says Joseph Sirbak, Labor and
Employment attorney with Dozen O'Honor.

Joseph is available to discuss the future of the phrase “ok
boomed” in the workplace.

Please let me know if this topic is of interest to you.

688,Happily giving up 40 years to work is a sign of mental immaturity,"*“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”* - Edmund Burke

*""The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That's why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system.""* - Arthur C. Clarke

*""It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.""* - Jiddu Krishnamurti

If you defend a system that takes huge portions of your time away, then you are clearly not as mentally mature as you could be. Time is the most important thing we have as humans. It's the key to learning, growing and spending time with our loved ones. If you do not see the value of time you are probably a victim of [propaganda.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_propaganda)

Giving up the most important thing you have in exchange for things that no human should of ever been deprived of (food, water, shelter) is not a sign of mental maturity, or something to be at all proud of. I understand many of us are forced to do labor against our will, but that is a reason to fight and point out the horrendous flaws with such a system. Not defend it. 

Nature has already decided for us that sharing is the most effective way to make sure our species is most taken care of. This is why when given the choice, children will share food [*by default.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFTspq_nzG4) Those of us who defend a system that is against sharing are much less mentally mature than children.

I remember as a kid, my parents telling me that you have to do what you don’t want to in life. It was explained that basically the only way to have a decent life is to work hard. I also remember the feeling of dread. As a fucking kid, I remember dreading to live my life. I believed that life was a hellhole, that you will die if you didn’t obey and do what you are told. If you prioritized anything you enjoyed over work, you will be punished, in one way or another. Using religion to push and justify these ideals overall fucked me up for life. I didn’t really learn to think for myself until I was a young adult. According to my therapist, I have a very weak sense of identity. Doping up on antidepressants is basically the only way I can even function now. Fuck the status quo. We bend over and get fucked year after year. Oh we’ll whine and complain about it, yet we end up bending over again and again. Not me, not anymore.

I couldn't help but feel after watching the documentary that not much has changed over the last 100-150 years other than the ownership class being more politically correct.

In my blind panic, I still managed to get word to my kitchen manager and have someone cover for me in case it took me awhile to find him. 

A few hours into my desperate bag-shaking, I get a message from the store manager. ""You need to come in and work your shift this is ridiculous""

""I'm looking for my cat until I find him. You don't get to determine what's important to people.""

""Your on thin ice pal you call in more than anyone that works here its becoming a unreliable situation/problem"" 

""I'm sorry I'm only human until it's inconvenient"" 

I knew I shouldn't have said that last bit, but frankly I was sick of this person pretending to care about their workers, only to turn around and berate them over basic priorities. Coupled with my panic about the cold coming at night, I was extremely on edge. 

And then I got the call from the regional manager. Through thinly-veiled contempt, they told me that what I said was rude and that I needed to hold my obligation to show up and work over everything else. 

""It doesn't sound like your life is on the line, it sounds like your cat is missing""

""My cat is an important part of my life if I haven't made that abundantly clear""

They went on and on about how I had an ""attitude"" and how they were ""just trying to smooth things out"" while admonishing me for searching for my pet instead of working. They had no idea that I had already gotten my shift covered, but when I mentioned it they immediately leapt to how much of a burden it was to pay someone overtime. 

""So you're telling me that paying someone overtime is more important to you than me making sure my pet isn't dead or hurt.""

""I....""

They scheduled me off for the weekend and told me to come to the office on Monday. They're going to feign talking it out, then just tell me I'm fired. 

I'm posting this here to remind everyone that management has never cared about you and never will. A corporation has never cared about you and never will, and they will hire people to pretend to care on their behalf. As soon as you become problematic, you cease to be useful.

So for most of my life I've been unemployed or semi employed. That has had it ups and its downs. I have never made enough to support myself with these odd and random jobs. I've had help from my family.

Recently I left the us I was just tired of the extra extra extra bad shit. So I came to Europe where supposedly workers have more rights and better treatment.

It is true that in general there are more benefits here and by benefits I mean health insurance.
Sadly that doesn't translate into actual healthy work environments. Work is just as toxic here as in the us.

In order to stay where I am I need to have a job it is a work visa after all. I have been unemployed for a while but found something that allows me to stay.

Sadly this job like most of ky other jobs is bottom of the barrel. Yes I'm supposedly a qualified professional of some kind but I hate it.

I mean I really dont get how work is supposed to be fullfiling. Idk what need is filled by having a screaming boss and a business that wants your 24 hour attention.

Still I want to stay here rather then the us. I hate the US so much. In the end often I think the only way to be allowed to exist and not be forced to exploited at work is to die.

It is legit the only solution. No job here means being deported and I won't have any life in the us. Its a shame. 

I suppose many other feel this way and it sucks becuase then there is no chance to enjoy whatever things might be good on planet earth.

That plus deep personal issues make it hard to want to exist. Its the worst situation now. I'll have to try and hold on for another month so maybe I can get a different visa type and just work a few hours. 

I'm so sad. Not angry not deeply depressed just sad and resigned to a faith as bad as death with no real solution.

I'm a 21 year old distance university student living with my single retired father in a remote village in Europe. It's extremely hard to find entry jobs (or any job) so i'm stuck in this degree, despite always despising studying and never having excelled at it in my life.

He wants to send me to a bootcamp for people addicted to their phones, or intern me in a psych ward. We've visited psychiatrists, I can't be honest with them because they tell me the same thing, to believe in the system.

My mother calls regularly to presure me into coming to live with her (another country) and to work in low end jobs, she brags about how waking up at 4 am and working for 10 hours will be good for me. It makes me anxious so I choose to stay with my father.

Now, we all work with strangers, are surrounded by strangers on a daily basis, and it feels like everyone is simply out for their own, to get head, to make more money.

I can’t seem to see, how older people, who have been in the work force for so long don’t stop and think what in the FUCK am I doing!? My ONE life. My ONE existence. I spend HALF if not MORE sleeping, working, commuting, preparing for the next day etc. it’s like our own lives, where we actually get to love, laugh, create, relax, BE HUMAN is such a small portion of out actual one existence before we disappear into blackness and nothingness. 

I’ve worked in machine shops, I recently got hired and quit my first day at a factory that made...bottle caps. Fucking bottle caps. PLASTIC. Any free moment I had, I would look up, almost screaming for help internally at all the people who seemed content, satisfied, even proud to be there, a good ol fashioned “hard worker”. Which to me, seems like an adaptation people had to make in order to live with themselves doing back breaking work for shit pay. Literally, the job was working a line, where this machine spit out bottle caps so fast you couldn’t see them, and it never stopped. On break, someone had to replace you. You couldn’t stop. Just bagging boxes, taping them, labeling them, putting them on a pallet, and trying to keep up with the conveyor as the boxes kept filling. I stopped, in the moments I could, looking at my fellow humans, some old, some young..just like..what the fuck are we doing? We are replaceable robots filling boxes with caps. But unfortunately this type of work is a commonplace for many. So we leave exhausted, to do it again tomorrow, to hardly get by on our bills, only to have a day or two off, to sleep and do it again. 

So people ask, why are we all on anti depressants?
Why is mental illness so fucking rampant?
Why is suicide so sky rocketed?
Why are there mass shooters?
Why does everyone look for escaping in drugs and alcohol?

I think from this post alone, you know exactly why.

How can we be aware of our own demise our own death and spend so much time just trying to simply survive. Are people just blissfully ignorant to the system we are apart of?

The funny thing is, this is all new. Industrialization, is so new, couple hundred generations?

For millions of years we existed in a much different way. We are living against our own nature. It is making us sick.

And you, reader, me, writer, this is our one life. Our one experience on Earth, and it’s spent stressed, worried, working ourselves exhausted..just. To. Live.

Fuck me.

746,"A conversation about work, wealth, and morality.","So I've been rolling this around in my head a lot lately, and I don't have all that many people in my life that seem willing to consider the idea. I'd like to ask the good people at r/antiwork, since we seem to be of similar philosophy.

It's probably going to be long, so don't feel bad if you don't read it. If you do read it, I'm honestly looking for your feedback and thoughts on it. And awaaaaaay we go.

Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas in the year 1492, so we'll use the last day of that year as a starting point. It has been 192,425 days since that date. If you started working on December 31, 1492, and you made 5,000 dollars a day, every day, without a single day off, you'd have $962,125,000.00 USD. To put that in context, if you made 5 grand a day every day for the last 527 years, you'd still be worth less than 1/100th of Jeff Bezos. You wouldn't even be a billionaire.

So it is apparent from that alone, that ""work"", in the traditional modern sense of the word, is not the way to aquire wealth.

So why should we aquire wealth? Well, to quote Wallace D. Wattles,

""A person develops in mind, soul, and body by making use of things, and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things.
Therefore, the basis of all advancement must be the science of getting rich.
The object of all life is development, and everything that lives have an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining. A person's right to life means to have the free and unrestricted use of all things which may be necessary to his fullest mental, spiritual, and physical unfoldment; or, in other words, his right to be rich.""

If we are to adhere to this philosophy, from the work ""The Science of Getting Rich,"" (which, for this post at least we are going to,) then we can infer two things. 

1) A society that inhibits the acquisition of wealth for the majority of its population also inhibits the mental, spiritual and physical growth of its population, and
2) The penultimate goal for that population should be to aquire as much wealth as possible, among as many people as possible, in order to maximize their own mental, spiritual, and physical growth, because the alternative is to accept a life of controlled mediocrity, enacted by the money making elite.

So, at this point, we've established a few points that are important to the conversation. That ""working"" will not make you rich, that not being rich is an alienation of your potential, that you deserve to be rich and feel all it's benefits, that the system is rigged to keep you from being rich, and acceptance of that system is acceptance of failure to reach your potential.

I feel it important at this point to mention, from empirical evidence, that the system is indeed rigged. I know many people my age (late 20's) with college degrees. Some are bartenders, some baristas, some carpenters. You want to know the one thing they all have in common? Not one of them is using their degree for employment. I know many retirees, who paid their taxes and did their time, and now struggle to stay afloat off of their Social Security allotments. You know the one thing they all have in common? Not one of them has enough money to live their ""Golden Years"" in comfort. Your degree won't get you a job, and even if it does, your job won't make your retirement comfortable. And one day, you'll be writing a food budget and realize, you wasted it all. They lied to you, and you bought it, and now your life is gone. And they didn't even pay you well enough to retire right. And they got away with it.

So this has all been the preamble to the actual subject of the post.

To get rich in a 2019 capitalist landscape, it appears that one must sacrifice their sense of right and wrong, good and bad, and look only at one metric: profit and loss. I say this meaning to say, that should you be writing books or making music or acting, you will not meet success until your product or service is one that people will buy. This means that more often than not, the moral standpoint is not the selling point of a person or service. To reference Bezos again, look at the working conditions of his warehouses. Straight up, unfiltered slavery. And so many people know this, yet so many of us still order frivolities with one day shipping from Amazon. The morality of the company is less important than the convenience of its service. 

As more evidence, watch stock prices when a large company like GM rolls back benefits to it's employees. Thousands of people losing health insurance at a job they've worked for decades, obviously a moral deficit. But it makes the company's numbers better. So stock prices invariably rise. Wealth being generated by the disenfranchisement of the working class. The economy in action.

What this means is, doing the right thing for people is not going to make you rich. Doing the right thing for money will. And therein lies the moral ambiguity.

I find it of utmost importance to free myself and as many others as I can from the grips of salary slavery. But to do so would be to sacrifice my conscience. The stocks that make money are often not the stocks that hold a moral high ground. The products that sell often encourage the masses to remain small, stay high and drunk and have sex, so they never see the part they're playing in a system working against them. And to top it all off, the goal seems so insurmountable that I often lose hope it can be achieved. And the only motivation I've found that has any real staying power, is greed. 

My greed tells me to win, no matter the cost. Lives might be ruined, but others will be saved. It tells me the only way to win is to play the game. That the only way to make an omelette is to break some eggs. 

But we're not talking about eggs. We're talking about human suffering in countries around the world, where the poor get poorer as the rich get richer. But to really enact change, I first must become unimaginably wealthy. But to become unimaginably wealthy, I must first play part in the game that so direly needs to change. And no matter the motivation, those who have not been fortunate enough to be guided by a burning and undying greed, they will hate me. 

This all comes up because I see a path now. I know how to do it. Develop products and services that people will buy. Invest in stocks that make money. Innovate with ideas, make my money make money. And do all of this without any regard for others, as long as I'm looking at that one, all important metric, profit and loss. And it can be done. By any of us. All we have to do is develop products that will sell, sell them, invest the money, rinse and repeat. Regardless of your current condition or circumstance, you can do it too. Find a gap in a market, fill it, reinvest. In that formula lies the potential for exponential growth.

But it also means investing in companies that profit off of  tragedy. The ones who make money on cancer. The ones who experience growth after mass shootings. The ones who steal healthcare from employees and guard their bottom line before anything else. The system is inherently evil. And regardless of the motivation, doesn't knowingly playing part in it make one evil as well?

If you're still here, I really appreciate your time and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Tell me what I'm missing. Fill in my blind spots. I've found myself a moral paradox that I can't seem to unravel on my own power.",False,drp66s,PublicDomainMPC,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/drp66s/a_conversation_about_work_wealth_and_morality/,7,8

758,I feel like giving up,"I don't want to post this to r/jobs because I don't really like the sub although my content is more suitable to be posted there.

I just had a phone screening for a position in Big4 Advisory. It is a huge load of bs. We have rescheduled the proper screening for 2 times because the recruiter deemed that I don't have enough knowledge about the divisions in advisory and what they do. I am grateful that the recruiter is so patient with me. But part of me feels like I want to give up this whole interview process. After the screening, there will be a test and another few interviews which I am not really excited about.

Maybe I didn't do enough research or talk to friends who are working in that line. I do have two friends working in consulting. I only have 1 year of working experience and advisory is such a vague concept for me. They really expect me to have a good grasp of what division that I wish to be in and to justify it. I'd appreciate more if they could give us a brief explanation instead. I don't know what you guys are doing, there's little to no information on your website and you expect me to choose the right division? 

Coincidentally, I have been experiencing one of the worst few weeks in recent months and I have suicidal ideation every single day. I couldn't bring myself to care and I don't have the energy to play this game with the recruiter. I know that they are only doing their jobs but I feel so depressed and I really want to politely decline this opportunity. My friends would probably kill to get a call back from this firm. If I told my family the truth they would've judged me so hard. I've been doing so many stupid and illogical things due to my struggle with depression (let's call it a depressive episode because I have not visited a professional).

 I feel like I would end up working overtime and being paid little. Then after a few years, I'd get burnt out and leave anyway. So there really is no point going through this struggle. I don't want to pretend that I know about advisory and I don't want to go through rounds of tests for something that I have no clue on.

He joined the company at the same time like I did but he got 5 years experience in the field.

773,Then and now: your boss and you,"From a book I'm reading on ""modern"" project management practices:

""Historically, the rules were simple: your boss made assignments, you carried them out. Questioning you're assignment was a sign of insubordination or incompetence. 

But these rules have changed. Today your boss may generate ideas but your assess how to implement them. You confirm that a project meets your boss's needs and then you determine the work, schedules, and resources you require to implement them.""

🤔

I've seen this so many times in practice. Heavy exploitation disguised under ""empowerment"". Not only you're doing your work, but you typically do what should be your boss's work. You make sure the project meets your boss's needs. You plan it. You execute it. You evaluate it. You report on it. 

And what does your boss do in the meantime? Plays with his/her balls behind the desk? ""Generate ideas"" this bestselling book says. Oh how fucking noble. 

Don't get me wrong, empowerment is great if marthed accordingly by a higher salary. But the evidence points out to the contrary: wage gaps between management and everyone else rising dramatically, while bosses working less and workers working more. 

My point is: be very aware of ""empowerment"" where your boss takes advantage of you and makes you do their work. Don't get psychologically manipulated into believing that you're given that work because your good and only if you work hard enough you'll be the boss. Fuck that.

Microsoft in Japan decided to test out 4-day

workweeks. The results? Productivity increased by 40%
largely in part to fewer meetings. Other effects: workers
took 25% fewer days off, 59% less paper was used, and

23% less electricity was used.
soranews24.com/2019/11/03/mid... #YangGang

Last August, Microsoft Japan carried out a
“Working Reform Project” called the Work-
Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019. For one
month last August, the company implements
a three-day weekend every week, giving 2,300
employees every Friday off during the month.
His “special paid vacation’ did not come at
the expense of any other vacation time.

And the results were pretty incredible!

First off, the reductions. Employees took 25.4
percent fewer days off during the month,
printed 58.7 percent fewer pages, and used
23.1 percent less electricity in the office

& 4 May Week Campaign and 3 others

3:56 of - Sov 3, 2019 - Twitter for Android

A lot of the increase in productivity is
attributed to the changing of meetings. With
only four days to get everything done for the
week, many meetings were cut, shortened, or
changed to virtual meetings instead of in-
person.

And even though it should seem obvious, it's
also important to note that 92.1 percent of
employees said that they liked the four day
workweek at the end of the trial. Due to its
success this year, Microsoft is planning on
repeating it again next summer or perhaps at
other times as well

I recently put my resume to career builder because I’m running out of money.

Most of the interviews I was offered were for literally my same job but in different companies. I was hesitant at first, but again, I needed money so I felt like I didn’t have much of a choice.

Because of my experience I pretty much had it in the bag 

First question- “how did you perform compared to your coworkers?”

“My coworkers were a lot older than me and relied on keeping notes with pen and paper. I just used excel and was doing 4x the work as them”

“How well do you know the software?”

“Well enough to write a manual for my coworkers so they would stop asking me questions”

The interviewer seemed really pleased until he hit me with the last question “why do you like your job?”

I honestly froze. I couldn’t even think of a lie to say on the spot. 

After a few “ums” and “well you see..” I just blurted out this spiel about why I quit.

Sometimes I really wish I could tell people to get a hobby. Experience life outside of work. Find out that you can actually have a meaningful and fulfilling life with different and interesting days. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know what I just described is an extreme privilege and not possible for absolutely most people. 

It’s just the fucking irony that people think my days are boring because I don’t work when they, in fact, do the same soul-sucking thing every single day while I for now have the freedom to do whatever I want and can fill my days out with things I actually want to do. I feel like people are completely blind to their own reality sometimes. But as Maya Angelou said, sometimes you’re blind because you wanna be. It’s easier thinking your days are fulfilling while being a wage-slave robot than actually facing the truth and see how monotone your days are and will probably be until the day you die.",False,drpx7i,Enough_Instance,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/drpx7i/how_the_hell_are_your_days_different_and/,1,29

826,Working For A Private Ambulance Company,"I’ve been working as an EMT for private ambulance companies for 6 years now and I’m absolutely disgusted with the job. The medics I work with are dedicated to their patients and the job but the people who own these companies are pigs. 

I treated a woman who was bleeding profusely from wounds inflicted by a stray dog that attacked her and she refused transport via ambulance to the hospital because of how much it would cost her. Almost every time I offer to take someone to the hospital I get the same question “How much is this gonna cost?” And I feel awful for these people. Taking advantage of someone when they’re in the middle of a medical emergency is disgusting. Not to mention these companies pay their workers next to nothing AND they are constantly caught engaging in illegal activities such as Medicare fraud and they still stay in business. The healthcare system in the US I’d absolutely fucked. 

If I don’t believe the condition of the patient warrants an ambulance ride I suggest they find other means to get to the hospital via Uber or a friends vehicle or even get a ride to a clinic.

827,I'm so sick of the job hunt process,"I currently have a job. I've held it for four years. I'm really good at it and have automated 90% of it. I took on additional responsibilities to keep myself busy and to try to keep learning. But I feel like I'm slowly rotting. My company is a nonprofit that operates like it still lives in the dark ages. After three years of exceeded expectations on all of my reviews, the promotion and raise that was dangled in front of me ceased to exist and ""this company likes to operate flat"" started ringing in my ear from how many times it was said.

So I started looking around, back on the job market. But all I've seemed to get are:

1.) ghosted by recruiters

The amount of times I've had to call a recruiter and ask if we're still doing an interview is more than all my fingers. And every time, it sours the interview before it begins for both parties. The recruiter doesn't like to admit they forgot so I have to dance around the issue and say ""oh no problem"" when really I'm upset they don't respect my time. 

I've had a few in-person interviews where the people I took a day off to meet don't return my follow up emails to see if the position has been filled. How do you meet with someone and then not close the loop?

2.) lowballed

I work at a nonprofit. I make the lowest of my market value range because of it. I'm tired of having my time wasted because these companies don't post the position's salary. I can no longer judge a position's senority based on years of experience requested and responsibilities. You want 10 years of experience for $40k (surprise!) contract to hire position, plus I'll be managing people? Go fuck yourself. And when I ask what the range is before the interview, they just ignore my fucking question or ghost me. 

3.)  Rejected seconds after I apply

No one's looking at these applications. And it's partially why so many of these positions are revolving doors. After filling out boxes and boxes of information, an algorithm throws you out in seconds.

I’m sitting on my train to work right now feeling bitter and resentful about my commute. So I thought I’d get this off my chest and see how everyone here feels about it. I work in New York City and take the Metro North train into work everyday. I’ve been doing it for this job for about a year. I can’t afford to live in NYC because it’s too expensive, but that is where my job is. So I live upstate. I spend about 5 hours per day commuting. (2.5 hours each way). First I have to drive 15 minutes to the train station (gas money), then I have to park ($3.50 per day parking fee), then I take the train ($475 per month). Then I walk a mile to my job from Grand Central to avoid the $130 monthly metrocard for the subway. I leave my house at 6:30 am and am at my desk at 9:00 am. I am exhausted before the day even begins. I don’t have time to do anything. I get home at 8 pm and just want to lay down. No time for exercise. No time for dating. No energy or motivation to care about basic household chores or shopping. I just want to sleep... and I am broke. I am single and have to do everything myself. This commute takes up so much of my day and a huge part of my paycheck. It’s not even cheap to live upstate. My rent is $1050 per month for a studio. I’ve been at my job for almost a year now so I was hoping for a good raise.  But I heard from coworkers that all I can expect is 2% which equates to about an extra $15 per week. Wow. That just helps me break even because my health insurance is going up and I’m sure my rent will increase when my lease ends too. I feel so trapped and don’t know what to do. I’m seriously considering looking for a new job and quitting. This makes me sad because I actually did like the job itself. But it’s so hard to feel like it’s worth the effort when all I do is stress about money and whether or not I can afford the transportation to get to my job. Imagine if the company reimbursed me for the train ticket and also paid me for the time spent traveling. I would want to stay with this company forever. For context, this is a very very successful company (not a small struggling business by any means). So, I just feel angry and helpless.

851,My boss hasn't had her period in months and I work AND live with my girlfriend but never see her.,"*long post*

I am lucky enough to work in a family-owned moving and storage company. I love all the people I work with and I love what I do, but because it is a family owned business, we're all kind of expected to do extra. I'm all about going the extra mile, I'll come in for an hour or two on my day off every once in a while if I know its busy, but we all work AT LEAST 10 hours a day (7:15-5:15) and I like my time off, as I have a house, a girlfriend, two cats, and our families to take care of/spend time with, etc.

As I said in the title, my girlfriend also works at the office with us, but she runs the office and I go out on estimates, so I really dont spend any time with her, and getting the same day off is very rare, and when we do we have to tend to all the other things I listed off. We also live ~30 minutes away from work and get home at the earliest around 5:45-6. Because we have to be up at 6am to go to work, we like to be in bed for 9. So that gives us AT MOST 3 hours to :

Cook AND eat
Shower
Clean the house
Feed/tend to the cats
Work out
Brush teeth/get ready for bed

I dont know about you, but it's very hard to do all those things in 3 hours (also please note no where did I mention actually doing shit we want to do) so a lot of times we have to choose. Usually it's the house and working out that take the back seat. Also my family and hers are always asking why we dont come around often or stay that long and we're like WE HAVE TO FUCKING LIVE TOO! Can I just lie in bed with the person I love and watch a goddamn movie?!

Now taking a look at my boss - we have actually grown very close and I strive to be like her, as she is extremely good at what she does and I admire her work ethic.. for the most part. She doesnt take days off. Like ever. She works probably a minimum of 11 hours a day and works every sunday (we're not even OPEN ON SUNDAYS FAM). Shes taken MAYBE 6 days off in the past 2 years and she told me about 6 or 7 months ago that her period was late and she thought she was pregnant. 

We were both excited for her until she took several prego tests that came up negative. Girl's been working herself so hard and stretching herself so thin that she doesnt get her period. I didnt even know that can fucking happen. She said this happened a couple of years ago too.. now shes been going to acupuncture therapy just so she can have her goddamn period again.

I started to feel like ""well I've been working my way up in the company and I want to get to where she is someday so I should be doing more"". I started coming in on all my days off at least for a couple hours, and I've taken to eating my lunch (a sad little turkey wrap) at my desk so I dont have to stop working. I was thinking it's all for the good of the company and itll pay off down the line, but looking at her and seeing how my life is going, I'm afraid I'll end up like that too and I dont want to just live (if that's what you can call it) to work.

Is anyone else in this kind of bind? Like I don't mind doing a little more because I like where I work and it's not like in a corporate setting where you're just a cog in the machine, theres 8 of us that work at the office and we all play a very important part, so I have really been an actual influence in the company, and we've been growing - actually opened up a new storage facility last year and we're almost full.

856,Considering going back to my construction job at a shitwater plant,"It was for an electrical apprenticeship but because of the time at which I joined and quit I never entered the apprenticeship. Now I'm vividly recalling what it was like walking into work each day feeling like shit, smelling the literal shit, feeling like dying, and then being berated by assholes all day. The hopelessness I felt thinking that this is my reality for years to come. I'm actually considering going back to this because I don't see a better alternative. It's a stable, relatively high paying career if I stick with it, and I tell myself that this time I'll exercise and take shrooms every so often, and not smoke weed every day, and religiously get enough sleep and that will hold back the depression. And I really don't want to keep going to school, making no money for things I want, and being stressed all the time for a nursing degree I don't even want. 

Right now I'm in an even worse scenario than either. I'm in Kenya visiting my asshole dad and attending the shitty university he works at and I've almost left early like 6 times and by the time this useless government gets me my national ID so I can leave since my visa is expired then it'll be like 3 weeks before the semester ends. Still considering leaving early even at that point. Have no freedom. Can't get the food I want, can't go anywhere, don't have my bike or pc, as much privacy, etc. I'd kill to be back at that shitwater plant job in the comfort of the US right now.

860,Rant of sorts... feeling so trapped,"Throwaway account.

So, I'm in my 20s and working in IT. Even decently talented at what I do, when mental issues aren't getting the better of me. I'm not even poor, median-ish wage but far below median expenses.

So I drive to office every single day to sit on my ass, be around people I would rather avoid that on their own already stress the hell out of me by being obnoxiously loud and, reeking of tobacco smoke and being disgusting, shit like that. Contrary to how that probably sounds, I don't hate everyone, it's more of a ""vocal"" (or visible? somehting like that) minority, but live waaaay out of the way from anyone I'm actually friends (who often tend to be stressed the fuck out, too) with, seeing them a couple of teams a year, decreasing tendency.


Right now, I'm sick, which is not much of a surprise, after a couple of particularly bad weeks, immune system can well be expected to be in the trashcan.


So, what am I working for? Rent and food? That's a worthwhile existence. Buying pointless shit to fuel the economy? Probably going to be preaching to the choir on that one. Having kids? Even if that were realistic, more humans who get to experience this dreary existence? Great! Play a ton of video games? Yeah, that's fulfilling...


With everyone just securing their own existence... or pointless profit, I just don't see how one can be actually happy *without* being ignorant. Like, there is no goal, or at least none that isn't basically obviously just ... hollow, shallow, void...


Delve into pointless but temporarily blissful hedonism? Great! Joining some fanatical cult to get rid of that feeling of emptiness inside? Even better! Spend all that money on psychotherapy? Like, I've already learned a lot about causes, patterns and approaches to cyclical depression, but as long as major contributors to it are basically completely out of my reach to control...


Have I consided moving in order to see friends (like, I don't not care about non-friends, but people you're actually getting along with well enough to be genuine friends are so rare, I value them and their happiness a lot) more often and be able to be ignorant of larger-scale issues more frequently? Sure, but the job market is just such a fucking rat race. Fucking CVs and job interviews, it just feels so degrading. Being judged to the bone for some nonsense like not maintaining eye contact by some fuckhead making people do pointless things with the end goal of facilitating selling even more consumerist junk on computers for money. And you're expected to have certificates, which, while in itself not completely reasonable as qualifications obviously are important, fuels an industry that at this point is like a tumor upon the tumor 90% of IT jobs already are.

Like, I don't see any way this is going to get better. Anti-capitalist / anti-corporate movements with actual traction mostly from before my birth have been crushed by corruption and totalitarian dictators. As a country, a humane model of ecconomy and government (and, being in Europe, I've already got about as close as we can currently get to that, but it's not enough to stop the nihilism) is always going to lose out against an exploiter, so long as nations exist, they are going to bully each other for the benefits of their own respective elites, and the most ruthless will have an edge.


Like... ignorance. So long as you're not -effectively, as society is twisted enough for that to be a *good* thing- fortunate enough to be born a sociopath devoid of empathy, what are you going to do? Work for underwhelming and further diminishing returns, retire completely burnt out and die? Become a hobo/neckbeard/hikkomori/alcoholic/otherdrugaddict/hermit and go full ignorant that way to stave off the despair? Don't think that's going to work. Outright suicide? Blegh.

865,Boots theory of socio-economic unfairness.,"Merry Pratchett - being poor is expensive

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars
a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather
boots cost fifty dollars. But an unfordable pair of boots,
which were sort of of for a season or two and then
leaned like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about
ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Times always
bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he
could tell where he was in Inch-Corpora on a foggy
night by the feel of the cobbler.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and
years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of
boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’
time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap
boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in
the same time and would still have wet feet.

His was the Captain Samuel Times ‘Boots’ theory of
soil-economic fairness.

Yesterday, I asked the dude ""What'd you do if you won the lottery?""

Note: The guy gets a boner when his manager shakes his hand, so you know what kinda person I'm talking about.


He went ""Oh man that would be awesome I'd buy a nice car and a nice house.""

""Nice"" I replied ""How would you quit work?""

""I wouldn't quit work, I'd keep working, and whenever I'm on vacation I would go to nice places.""

I was shook. ""You'd keep working, fucking why?""

He hesitated, before going ""Idk man that's all I've been doing for the past decade Idk what else I would do.""

Btw he's not like a doctor or something, hes got a standart office garbage job.

THIS is what happens when people are succesfully  indoctrinated to the maximum. They literally don't exist. As I kept talking to the guy I realized there is no guy, there is no person I am talking to, it's just a drone. 

So I went ""Dude if I'd win the lottery I wouldn't even call work, I'd just get the check and fuck off to the caribbean and roast in the sun while planning my next steps, I wouldn't even waste half a thought about work, I wouldn't even bother emptying my flat I'd just be on my way lol""

He looked at me, OBVIOUSLY offended as fuck and just said ""Haha, ye."" 

After that has very short with his answers and clearly didn't want to be around me anymore. His whole persona was being threatened and it seems like he couldn't handle it. He seemed to become aggressive even.


Few days later I went out walking in the woods with a girl I was dating. She was a total fucking bore, no hobbies, no interests. All she cared about was relationships and her future. ""Saving up to buy this and then I may get a better car in case I got kids blablabla.

I asked her the same question, about the lottery, and got the same exact answer. She'd also keep going to work.


Am I weird for finding this terrifying and insane?
Even if they had utter freedom in form of a gigantic money supply, their minds are so broken that they lost any form of autonomy and free will.

Again, I don't know the provenance of this shirt, but I'm so fucking tired of companies acting like this sort of attitude is healthy or necessary to work minimum wage jobs that are understaffed and fucking *hard*. I don't want these workers to be obsessed with me; I want them well-paid, well-staffed, and with a good work-life balance. To suggest that *customers* are the reason they come to work every day is ludicrous. People are there for money; they are there because in many cases they have no other choice. They are often not happy in their jobs and don't care about customers. I don't expect them to, given the work environments that exist currently.

I figured there was no point in staying there and handed in my resignation. I was met with anger. Lots of it. My boss told me to **make an ""appointment"" with him to pick up my stuff from the office (I was already there...)as he's busy and didn't have time to ""waste"" on me. That I should get out of his office and that I was ""trespassing""** (I was getting my stuff from my seat since I've resigned and was trying returning company property).

I get that startup companies have limited budgets, and so they can't hire many employees, but one person shouldn't be worked as if they are a whole team (like marketing, logistics, and sales) which usually would consist of 5-8 people a department.

If society were only relieved of the waste and expense of keeping a lazy class, and the equally great expense of the paraphernalia of protection this lazy class requires, the social tables would contain an abundance for all, including even the occasional lazy individual.   
&gt;  
&gt;Besides, it is well to consider that laziness results either from special privileges or physical and mental abnormalities. Our present insane system of production fosters both, and the most astounding phenomenon is that people should want to work at all now.   
&gt;  
&gt;Anarchism aims to strip labor of its deadening, dulling aspect, of its gloom and compulsion. It aims to make work an instrument of joy, of strength, of color, of real harmony, so that the poorest sort of a man should find in work both recreation and hope.

943,The extent of brainwashing,"Should I just give up? Today I had a chat with my mother about post graduation plans, and it’s been making me feel worse than I’ve already been feeling.

Firstly, a bit of background for myself. Family wise, I come from a lower middle-class neighborhood with Nigerian immigrant parents. (Income-wise, my father is muddle class as a self employed attorney  and my mother is very much working class as a permanent substitute teacher and part-time retail associate) I’m a “minority” (black), though I don’t like thinking about people in such arbitrary and useless classifications. 
My father is a abusive man, both physically and mentally, to practically everyone he meets. Myself and my sister were typically subject to beatings and insults whenever we didn’t behave in a way that he found acceptable, and he sometimes had huge arguments with my mother. My mother used to join him in his abuse, though in a lighter scale, but ever since an incident (long story short, mother had a medical hernia bill that needed to be paid, father started getting angry that she didn’t get a job with health insurance for the family (he’s self employed so he didn’t have insurance), he then started talking down to my mother for making a pitiful wage as a substitute teacher, to which my mom replied that she spent most of her years as a stay at home mom making sure that the house was in order, my father’s nightly meals were cooked, and that the children were looked after. The argument ended with my father threatening a divorce (this happened 8 years ago, to this day, he’s still in this house because he doesn’t want to go through the financial hell that divorce courts would put him through, so he simply moved to another room in the house)), my mother started putting her focus more on her children and basically started being a lot more supportive of me and my sister, especially me, since feels that I’m impacted the worst by my father (though she stills has her quirks inherited from her culture, like expecting me to say good morning to him even though my father and I have not been on speaking terms since I was 16 (due to another incident, she herself still greets my father despite their separated status)). I now have a decent, positively leaning relationship with my mother, though I’m eternally frustrated at the fact that she can’t see what I believe I see.

School wise, Im now in the final year of university, majoring in music (the problems with the education system itself make this barely tolerable), but honestly, I went to college because of high school propaganda and parental pressure (18 year old me practically believed that the world would end if he didn’t go to college), not realizing my mistake. I don’t know how I did this, considering I really went through a lot of hell just to graduate high school (anti-authoritarianism started manifesting within me, skipping classes, having to be sent to counselors for “oppositional defiant disorder” or whatever, etc, rowdy students that tend to be a feature of disadvantaged communities, etc.). Back in high school, I was kept sane by my feelings of belonging to a music group, among others, as well as my blindness to how the world worked. 

Throughout my college years I, by means of continuously growing daily bullshit, was more or less forced to see our society for the absolute mess that it is. For the first two years, I went to community college. Now normally, I should be debt free, but of course, my naive younger self took on debt to try and cover the costs of self-publishing a book that I wanted to write. (Because of that and university tuition/dorming costs, I will graduate with a debt of around 35k) My goal back then was to make a lot of money, though I’m not sure I truly understood why. Even back then, I utterly despised the educational system (it’s one of the traits of my novel’s protagonist) though back then I only thought about the restrictive feeling of school, and I wasn’t as acutely aware of the economic system that practically needed school to work (Capitalism). However back then, I was alarmingly materialistic. My plans were to become a super rich author and buy cars and jet planes and such things. I wasn’t quite aware why I wanted these things, because clearly they’re far beyond what I valued now, though now I believe that my past materialism, (as well as people’s current materialism) is because of the social respect associated with having things. Being the analytical person I am, I feel like I can understand why. With the soul crushing 5 day 40 hour work week (my mother sporadically works depending on what her two jobs demand, and my father typically works 12 hours 6 days a week) we can’t settle for social fulfillment by BEING things (hobbies, talents) so we have to settle for HAVING things. And an entire culture of materialism grew from that, I suppose. Interestingly, my plans towards owning the expensive vehicles were mostly to just pilot/drive them on my own, which kind of makes me realize that at the very least, my will to pilot planes is genuine, though now I can think of better ways to achieve this. 

Everything thing changed when I transferred to university (some top ranked state school in NY). I felt completely alienated from the people around me. I felt like they grew up in lives and backgrounds that I could never begin to understand. Of course, it doesn’t help that I’ve been encountering rich Chinese students every now and then with their fancy clothes and cars while other people worldwide are struggling. I’m in school because belief that I need it for a better future, and they’re practically here FOR FUN. Don’t ask me how anyone could see school as fun, but I guess that when you grow up with a lot of money, you can find a way to make anything fun, I suppose. I don’t have any friends here to this day. It feels like every day here, some new thing would bring me in a worse mood and I would be continuously and endlessly trying to analyze why. Much analyzing and an existential crisis and depression later, I deduced that all the problems that I feel exist in my life can be traced back to capitalism. Eventually, as I started to think about my future, I started regretting choices that I wasn’t aware that I made when I was fourteen. I started regretting not being a top student since 14 so that I could get a scholarship to go to an aviation college so that I wouldn’t have to suffer more after graduation. I started feeling guilty for daring to try and find peace in my rough childhood with video games and music as my hobbies, instead of studying to get good grades. I think about my future life and I realize that there’s not hope for me since there’s now that many jobs that I’d be willing to do. Currently, my goal is to be an airline pilot (one of the few jobs that I believe I could enjoy, or at least tolerate) but there’s a massive barrier to entry in the form of 80-100k for training. The only way I can make the money needed for that is to have an income from a corporate job (that’s all I imagine I can do, given my useless major. Though I feel better when I remind myself that most computer science jobs are still corporate helljobs) so that I can have a high enough income for the loan or paying it directly. However, assuming that the cards are right (that I can live with my parents rent free; as long as my mother is present my father won’t do anything to me, though as part of my father retirement plan he wants to sell the house after my sister’s graduation in two years so I’ll have to figure out housing by then. I might still have to live with my mother, but knowing that my mother will be strained to afford an apartment by herself (we live in the NY metropolitan area) I would probably have to contribute to rent (Supporting my mother as a concept doesn’t bother me, but having to extend my time in the corporate world would)) I would be in a corporate hellscape for at least two years, I’ve realized that corporate culture is an extension of everything I despise about college (whose real purpose is to make you a corporate drone). In college, unfettered liberalism is rampant (note that I don’t support either “liberals”, “conservatives”, or any political leanings for the most post (I tend to imagine an anarcho-communist society) but their terms are still useful for outlining my frustrations. Liberals are typically middle class or higher people (like the demographics of my school) who seem to pretend to care about social progress, but will never do anything to address the underlying issue, in the fear of it uprooting their content lifestyle. (As an analogy, think of it like how psychiatry and therapy treats the symptoms of depression, but not the root (which is our broken society)). They will talk about the environment, but not point the blame to the capitalist system that causes environmental damage. They will talk about oppressed immigrants, but not talk about the fact that we live in a world that necessitates people being in worse off conditions. They live in some fantasy world, and seem to pride themselves with adopting corporate doublespeak (best practices, work as “family”, etc). To be honest, I pity them.

Now today, I just got back from a dental operation (which was needed because I put off needed dental care for too long (3 years) which happened because of my fear of getting into more debt (the tooth now requires an extraction). I’ve been in a lot of pain right now, I’m wondering if my gum abscess will spread to the rest of my body and kill me (I’m on antibiotics, but still) and I can’t stop myself from feeling like there is absolutely no hope of things getting better, either for myself or the world. This whole experience has taught me that if I don’t develop an obsession towards making money soon, I’ll have to waste my days eroding the remainder of my soul making corporate dollars if I ever hope to become a pilot (one of the few jobs is be willing to do in this broken world. Plan B, if I’m medically incapable of being a pilot or if I can’t take shit anymore, is getting out of this wicked country to TEFL somewhere else. I would have considered being a music teacher, and in a perfect world, I wouldn’t mind something like that at all (minus the authorial educational system part), but that requires grad school, and I really don’t want to go through that.)

I was talking with my mother about graduation, and she went on ad gave the drivel about how a college degree will guarantee that you’re never poor as long as you “make the degree work for you”. You know, I really have to wonder how an immigrant who has strong ties to her own hone culture can be so...caught up in American propaganda. This is a woman who seems to base her entire life on what other people tell her, regardless if it’s truly right for her or not. She got into huge debt to have a US masters degree in ESL (simply because her cousin told her it would be a good idea), the school (my former high school) that she’s been working in as a permanent sub refuses to make her anything more than a permanent sub (my mother suspects racism in the hiring practices, which I’m inclined to believe is a valid reason. The school, despite typically being 99% blacks and Hispanics, apparently refuses to hire or promote anyone who isn’t black or Hispanic, or rather, that at the least, it rarely happens.) She got her degree 7 years ago, so I suspect that she’s no longer fresh in the job market (she didn’t take a teaching position in Maryland after graduation because she wanted to make sure she was near myself and my sister, and had she moved away, my father would have definitely uprooted our lives). She’s also in her mid fifties, so I’m inclined to believe that it’s too late for her to have any chance with another school. And I’m pretty sure that my high school knows this, which means they know that she seriously can’t challenge them lest she damages her remaining livelyhood. She’s also still working after school at retail.

TLDR; feeling untold dread and hopelessness,  wondering how people around me don’t see anything is wrong, and have no clue if there is no real escape for myself or other people.
