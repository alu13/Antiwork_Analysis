2,Human societies NEED workers in one capacity or the other to sustain themselves.,"I know this will be controversial in this sub, but I honestly am posting in good faith. I want to preface this by saying that I completely understand that capitalism has fucked our society, seemingly beyond repair. Private institutions in pursuit of profit control all of our lives. Most jobs are meaningless tasks done by average people under the threat of homelessness, meant to keep the system running. 15-20 individuals run the world. I know, it's fucked. I still think some people need to hear this. Anyway I'm an industrial technician. In the course of my work, I travel around to all types of manufacturing plants, railyards, ports, municipal works, farms, etc. All the areas of society that are completely invisible unless you're looking for them. In the years I've been doing this, I've made a couple realizations that in my view don't really mesh with the whole ""antiwork"" philosophy. I'd like to hear what you guys think.

&amp;#x200B;

For industrial or even simple agrarian human society to maintain a level of comfort and egalitarian distribution of resources, workers are NEEDED.  Especially with the number of people we have on the planet right now. Machinery needs to be designed, built, operated and maintained or there's no way we feed, clothe, and house all 7 billion of us. An international supply chain of some type needs to be designed, managed, and staffed. Medical professions need to exist. Mental health professionals need to exist. Infrastructure for all this needs to be built.  Waste needs to be disposed of properly. People need to closely monitor and regulate our impact on the environment. Educated and experienced people need to train the next generation to do these jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

When humanity industrialized we crossed the Rubicon. There's no going back. Reverting to some kind of hunter-gatherer ""back-to-the-land"" type deal would doom literal billions of human souls to a life of suffering and death. This is why I don't like the 

&gt;hehe I was meant to prance along the beach, not work my stinky job

posts. Everyone has a role to play in the survival of their species. This is how humans have worked since forever. Big or small, you need to contribute. Even in a completely utopian society. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think that an absolutist view of ""no more work"" just isn't viable in any situation. I would gladly go do a task every day if I knew for an absolute fact that I was making a positive contribution to humankind. Those jobs literally don't exist though. Hell, even doctors are under the thumb of insurance companies. So, that's all I have to say.

TL;DR: It's too late to go back on agriculture and industrialization. There is a staggering amount of work that needs to go into the smooth operation of a human society, even a completely fair and egalitarian one. People need to be motivated to do this work and pass the knowledge down to the next generation. That being said, the way society is set up currently is totally fucked and IMO it's time for guillotines.",False,ouwvgt,ChristmasInKentucky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ouwvgt/human_societies_need_workers_in_one_capacity_or/,5,1

Now that I’m working and earning (a tiny amount) of money… why the hell was I so jealous of adults. I don’t even want these things we’re conditioned into wanting to work and earn money so we can afford them… I don’t want to make any big purchases knowing exactly how many hours of my life I’d have to sacrifice to make up for it. It’s a good epiphany in a way. I don’t “need” anything besides time, and I intend to give away as little of it as possible. At work, you’re treated and spoken to exactly like a child at school.

8,Super frustrated.,"It’s 1 am here and I’m on mobile so forgive me for any formatting and grammar issues. I’m losing sleep over this issue and I grow angrier by the day. Basically because we did such a great job over the summer, or reward is going to be to have to work Saturdays forever now. Lemme give you some context. 

The Air Force sent a bunch of cadets all over the U.S. to different colleges with flight schools in order to get their private pilot license in 8 weeks. I’ll save you the hyper specifics about all that, but it’s hard. It’s hard on the student. It’s hard on the instructor. Well our school got several of these kids and the instructors ended up with 2 each. We were told that they would do two lessons a day would be good enough to stay on schedule. 

With weather and aircraft maintenance, it became quickly apparent that the flight instructors were going to have to work Saturdays to make up for lost days. Our normal schedule is 7-7 Monday-Friday. As long as our students are scheduled at least once a day then it’s up to us on how to make our schedule. Every so often, some instructors will come in on a Saturday or Sunday to get some flying in during good weather, but since the inception of the flight school, it’s NEVER been required. 

Well as you can imagine, we busted our asses to get as many of these kids through the program. And finished with a 80% pass rate. 80. Fucking. Percent. Hell, last year there was a flight school in our area that didn’t even get ONE kid done. But despite the constant weather, aircraft being down due to maintenance issues, the kids not studying like they should, and numerous personal sacrifices on our part, we had over 80% get their private pilot license. 

As you can imagine, upper management for the aviation department at the college all got hit by the good idea fairy. Because we did such a good job, they are going to make us work 7-7, 6 days a week like we are some puppy mill for pilots. Oh and get this, we are still considered part time employees.

19,LinkedIn is the worst app ever invented,"I hate the app, I seriously do and deleted it for good.

The website sucks to begin with. It’s full of people who are glorifying work achievements as if it’s something to be really proud of when all you are doing is wage slaving for the profit of someone else. 

Constant barrage of notifications and likes about “work, work and work” aka certifications, awards, events, seminars, self glorification posts and what not. Instead of inspiring you it makes you fall into a downward spiral of depression and melancholy. Also, I am fed up of work colleagues five days a week 8 hours a day, I don’t want to see more of them after work! 

Lastly, if you just want to keep your LinkedIn up to date (I understand the fears around recruiters not trusting you if you don’t have a profile which is a shitty reason to be honest but hey we all still need to find jobs and work for money) it might do some good if you occasionally update your info on the website but refrain from downloading the damn app; at least you will avoid going back to it every time.

Work sucks anyway, why remind yourself of it. By the way I hate WhatsApp and having to add my colleagues on it so I see their faces every now and then.

28,If the work you do does not benefit into capitalism or you can’t fit in then conservatives want you dead or in jail,"In the end from analysis you can see all they want is for people who can’t fit into capitalism to ‘not exist’ or ‘disappear’. 

Some people have asked them what they think about governments lifting restrictions on certain land areas where they can live without being moved or harassed constantly by the police and their answer to that is still ‘no’. Even if its cheaper.

The ideology espoused by the GOP and conservatives around the world advocate for the death of anybody who cannot conform to capitalism. Even if they are disabled in some cases.

They want to kill, they are just too afraid to say it because if they did then everybody would see them for who they are.

The GOP form of conservatism atleast, found both in the U.S.A and around the world is an ideology of genocide.

The honest ones I’ve questioned about their beliefs try to justify the deaths that occur as ‘a process of the natural order and survival of the fittest where the strong rule’ just as the Nazi party did.

If you want the expose the beliefs of any yourself I would say try asking them a question that involves some form of compromise to let people survive at the bare minimum like “Why not allow homeless people an area of land they can legally live on then for the time being?” or “What about outcasts or people who cannot fit into the system no matter what?” (They mostly try to justify that with a statement of ‘bees and other animals in nature killing off those who cannot fit in’ in my experience).

38,life doesn’t revolve around work and you don’t need the newest iphone,"I live in one of the wealthier countries in Europe and my parents are immigrants. My dad owns a business and my mum is a housewife. I’m really happy with the family dynamic. I see many families around me where both parents work, sometimes because they can’t live on one wage, a lot of times because they are materialistic and simply want to consume more and more. In turn, their children spend most of the time in daycare and don’t get enough attention. It seems like these people only care about money and materialistic stuff. It’s a huge difference compared to the culture my parents are from. My family back home spend more time with their families and friends. Their social network is bigger and stronger, life doesn’t revolve around work, most people have a (small) business which they can live a normal life with (except may be some luxuries), their kids are content and in general they seem happier than a lot of families and people in this country.

Now I’m not saying life back home is better or not, a strong workculture has it’s pros and cons. All I’m saying is that some countries in the Western world need to tone it down a little (and maybe people back home need to step up a bit). But anyway, I feel like the balance is gone.

While yes, he's a boomer, he's one of the unlucky ones who will work until he dies, or close to it. 

He always worked holidays, overtime, and extra weekends. Everyone liked him, he's one of the experts everyone would go to for help, and he's been in his field for almost 40 years and this particular job for 20 years.

The manager who fired him, and the other oldies, had only been working there 2 years. 

And to get his severance package, they made him sign a stack of like 100 papers that amounted to ""I won't sue the company due to age discrimination nor any other type of discrimination, as part of the agreement to receive this lump sump.""

Despite being highly skilled, after several months of searching, the only job that would hire a 59 year old was part time, less pay, and... you ready for it?... ZERO time off period. 

That means no vacations, and when his 86 year old mother dies (she has cancer) he'll have to hope the funeral is on a weekend, plus take no time off to mourn. Let's hope he doesn't have a medical emergency either... not to mention he's a bad diabetic and already has to ration insulin... go ahead and look up the sick scam known as insulin prices and people having to hop to Canada to afford insulin.

Sick, sick, just beyond sick!!! 

I feel for everyone, and really feel for the older folks still having to grind it out and face the hammer of doom of being tossed out like trash by about age \~50 or so.

I've heard in the tech industry, age discrimination can start even earlier, around age 40.

66,Just got told that my work doesn’t pay you in “10min increments” so if you get held back a couple of minutes you’re not getting paid.,"It’s a basic shitty retail job. I asked the manager what to do if I get held back 5, 10, even 15 minutes past my clock out time if it’s busy or the other shift doesn’t show up. They just said to write down my normal clock out time because they don’t pay in 10minute increments. Sorry what? Sounds like wage theft to me. In the months I’ve been working there this is the first instance of pure fuckery at an otherwise pleasant job. 

I even asked a more senior co-worker about what they do if they get held back and they say they have to check with the manager if it’s ok to clock out the time they stayed back and if it’s not on then “that’s just tough luck”. 

I don’t care how much of a non team player it makes me look the moment it hits my clock out time, regardless of how busy it is, I’m out of there idgaf anymore. I can tell some co-workers resent me for it especially if I leave in the middle of a rush but if i ever get confronted by management about it I’ll just remind them that I don’t get paid in those “10 minute increments” so I’m not staying back. 

To add: I hate clock off systems where you have to manually input your clock off time. Every second spent on the floor is work and if you run into a customer on the way to the clock off computer that still counts as work. Even if it takes you only a minute to answer their questions. After typing this all out I’m just now realising how this workplace is the exact same retail hellhole as any other retail job I’ve had. It’s comforting to have come to this realisation after a few months of feeling like maybe this company isn’t as bad as every other exploitative company. Since when I leave I won’t feel any remorse or have secodn thoughts. 

TLDR; manager said if you get held back after your shift you’re not getting paid because they don’t pay in 10min increments. Had a moment of realisation while typing that this job isn’t special and I won’t feel bad for leaving.",False,ovb3up,schootle,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ovb3up/just_got_told_that_my_work_doesnt_pay_you_in/,15,1

I've always deplored how some people (my family, especially) will consider their job as an integral part of their identity, and will respect you proportionally to what you do. I've also never understood why being unemployed and happy is much more frowned upon than being employed and unhappy... Do we really care about mental well-being, as much as we claim we do, if we're implying that something must be wrong with them (not their *job*) when they're feeling depressed? Why do so many people need pills (and/or copious amounts of coffee) for their work to be tolerable? This isn't normal. THIS. ISN'T. NORMAL. And to top it off, you have ""ordinary"" workers telling other ordinary workers that they need to work harder, and put up with the same shitty conditions they do... It's like they dug themselves so far deep in their pit of self-hatred that they can't see what's best for them anymore, AND want to throw *others* in it with them, rather than choosing to climb themselves OUT of it.

92,I think people mistakenly write this subreddit off as a bunch of lazy millennials who just want the government to give them more stimulus checks,"It isn't that r/antiwork is actually anti work, but anti modern slavery. 

Our society has collapsed into slave like system because of our government. 

The Government, via their decisions, policies and regulations have destroyed our Nation, I will tell you how they did it and how we can take back our nation back from the banking cabal. 

It started in 1913 with the creation of the federal reserve, a bunch of banks duped Woodrow Wilson into giving them power over the dollar which was backed by Gold. Then the government via FDR made holding Gold illegal and devalued the dollar by raising the price of Gold to $35 an ounce. There should have been a second revolutionary war when this happened but Americans were too complacent with their consumption and lifestyle they were creating for themselves. The saying goes like this, ""hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men and weak men create hard times."" We are currently in the hard times phase.  So instead of doing the most American thing and starting another war, Americans just let the corrupt government take their liberties away by first controlling the money. 

Then came Bretton Woods, the world decided to give the US unrestrained power by making the dollar the world reserve currency because it was backed by gold. The problem is that you can't have a strong economy and world reserve status, because the other countries like China will devalue their currency and manufacturing will leave the country of a high valued currency for a weaker one, causing cheaply produced goods that then ship back home to be sold at the same price, thus making a lot of more money than if it had been produced in us dollars. Why would you pay ten dollars to produce an item to sell it for fifteen dollars when you can make it for two dollars in China and earn thirteen dollars in profit when sold in the US? So that is why we basically have no quality jobs today and everything is service. We have people that sell chairs, transport chairs, but no one makes chairs. 

Fast forward to 1971, inflation hasn't really gotten out of control because even though the federal reserve was printing money, they were still restrained by the gold standard. You can print paper money but you can't print Gold and a certain amount of dollars represented one ounce of Gold. Simple laws of supply and demand, if there is a lot of supply, there is less demand, so prices fall. If there is a lot of demand but low supply, prices rise. This is why Gold costs more than Silver, because it is rarer than Silver even though silver has more uses than Gold. 

So in August of 71, Nixon decides to ""temporary"" suspend the convertibility of dollars (trash) into Gold.  This is allowed the federal reserve to print money without restraint causing the great stagflation of the 70s. Everything we buy with our money since then has gotten more expensive every year because they won't stop inflating the dollar. If more dollars exist, then people can buy more stuff, sellers see the increase in sales, so they raise prices, that is why a house went from $9000 in 1971to $300000 in 2021, because they have printed a lot of money. Now we are seeing inflation like crazy because Trump and Biden have printed more than half of the dollars ever created in the last year. And we haven't even seen Biden's inflation yet, the current price increases are caused by Trump. 

Now compound the fact that the government has made it impossible to start a business with little money because of all the regulations they have made, a new small business can't compete with a behemoth that has existed for decades, the government is responsible for creating monopolies, I suggest you watch John Stossel's youtube channel, he covers this type of corruption in depth. But the other problem is the money printing and something called the Cantillon effect. When the fed creates money, they gave it to the rich/the banks, the rich then having bought everything there is to own, spend the money in startups like uber, amazon and lyft. They basically fund these companies and allow them to operate at a loss for a while why they destroy local business by offering prices they can't compete with. Once they have destroyed the small businesses and their competition is wiped out, they can raise prices. This is caused by our government; they choose winners and losers via the rules they have created. 

Now you can't start a business because the cost of starting up is like 250k. You can't open a retail store because of the cost and because you can't outsource your production to China like the corporations can. You have to compete with Chinese prices but have can't produce Chinese currency. So you raise your prices and have zero sales, forcing you to take a job at a starbucks, like everyone else. And since everyone else has to work in the service economy, they all commute to work, now you are losing 3 hours a day in traffic. 

You spend all your time working, preparing, and commuting and have no time to farm your own food or cook. Instead of being self-sufficient like our ancestors, we rely on the supermarket and restaurants for our survival. You don't have a choice; you live in an apartment with no time. 

The US dollar is about to collapse, it will go into hyperinflation when Biden's money printing begins to appear in the CPI. How do you protect yourself and at the same take on the banking cabal that is causing this misery?

Gold and Silver. The US dollar index falls when Gold rises, when Gold falls the US dollar rises. In order for us to gain our freedom again, we basically need our currency to get wiped out. The world governments would then reject the dollar as the world reserve currency, learning from their mistake and how the US has weaponized the dollar for political gain, they will never give another country world reserve currency again. Instead they will return to the Gold standard, some stupid countries will make their own crypto currencies, but no one is going to trade with them because who the hell would give gold or silver for virtual money?

The global economy will return to the way it was before the modern era, people transacting in gold and silver, at that point who would ship their manufacturing from the US to China? It would cost the same to produce in both countries, except in China you are dealing with their regulations and shipping it over here, so no one would keep their operations over there if they don't have to.

Because if you would, wait a minute and listen to me, at first when you do it without money, you have to spend less time and effort to do it , as we said above.

So, why don’t you do it without money, and then the money you would spend to do it before, now you can spend it to do something else you want.

Why again? Because this isn’t what money does. When you use money to do something, money reduces the time and effort you have to spend to do it, or you are wasting your money.

109,Work saved my life,"For the record, I am against being a modern day slave, but I think some of you have it way wrong. I just wanted to share my story to try to have some people understand my point of view. 

I never graduated high school, I still don't have a diploma or equivalent. I had gotten my chick at the time pregnant while on 11th grade. I was 17. Everybody's reaction of course was 
""Time to get to work!!!"".




I dropped out of school and started working construction in California. I had a baby on the way and didn't want to let my parents nor my future wife down so I did what I had to do. Little did I know at the time it would lead to my downfall, and then an extreme uprising. 




I see some people here complaining about working 8 hours and then doing a 2 hour commute. LOL. 

It was normal for me to work 12 hours and drive 4 hours home EVERY SINGLE DAY for months. I slept for 2 - 4 hours every single day for weeks and weeks. I hate to sound like boot-strappers but I laugh at an 8 hour work day. The commute times in southern California are horrendous to say the least. I would do it though because I was making great money at the time, 20 bucks an hour plus overtime at 80+ hours a week motivated me alot. 


I started to recognize that what I was doing was actually detrimental to my life. Especially when my fiance at the time left me. In that moment I realized I had let work ruin what was most important to me. My family. 
I won't go into to much depth because I could write a novel about it, but my life went into a downward spiral from there. I had nothing. Hardly ever saw my kids and the ex was getting me hard for child support and alimony. Which forced me into living in a literal shack. You want to talk about slavery? How about the government literal forcing you to pay 2k a month to your ex spouse. Even when my income dropped significantly during covid. I was facing jail time because I literally couldn't afford it. The courts answer to this was basically ""tough shit, go to work"". 

I was stuck in a paradox of life that had forced me to work perpetually.

 The less I saw my kids the more child support I had to pay which resulted in me working more and seeing my kids even less etc etc etc. 

Thank God for Ramon cup of noodles. Thank you Maruchan. I will forever support that company. 


So I did what I had to do. I was 26 and in this predicament of life that only america would put me in. I was on the brink of homelessness even tho I made 35 bucks an hour. At that time the way I saw it, I had two decisions. Give up everything and kill myself to end it all or put my head down, stop feeling sorry for myself, and get it together. 

I still have the piece of paper where I deduced my life to those solutions. 

The only motivating factors for me were simply my two kids. So I came up with a game plan. The first rule was to stop coming up with excuses for anything and to start taking accountability for everything. So I did. Anytime I felt sorry for myself or was upset about something I would try to change it in my own way. Sick of my employer? Look for a new job. Not saving money? Reduce my bills to zero. 

I had literally sent out 100 or more resumes to different companies before I found one that was halfway decent. I moved out of my $1500-a-month shack and lived in my truck for the next year to save money. Which I did. I eventually saved enough to buy a travel trailer that I lived in for the next 4 years. I still have it. 

It was during this time I had started to literally see my work pay off. I was actually saving money from the sacrifices I was making. I was able to save 100k in 4 years which I used to move to Arizona and buy a 150k house. My payment over a 30 year loan was 325 bucks a month. During my time in Arizona, all those 12 hour days payed off because I ended up moving up the ranks in my company making a decent salary. I had child support and my house payment plus utilities on a 80k salary. I was able to save more money and over the next few years I would pay my house off early and buy another house which I rented out. 

This is where america happened in a good way. 


I would eventually start paying off my rental house, and collecting the full rent amount straight to my savings account, while also still working for a construction company, while also doing door dash and Uber eats. I worked my ass off but only because I could start to see a plan coming together. 

I could write a novel about this next part but I would basically keep doing what I was doing and buy a cheap house, fix it up, rent it out, pay it off. That was the formula which led to me making 3k a week in passive income on top of my employment. I would eventually quit my job altogether and live off of the rent payments, which would lead me to opening my own business, a boba shop, then two, then three.  


I tell you this because if you are willing to make the sacrifice in the short term, hard work pays off in the long term. Don't let people trap you into work. I promise you, I could lose everything today and work a minimum wage job and get it all back again before I turn 45. It's because I can create solutions and not excuses. The fact of the matter is, this is how capitalism works. You either play the game or become a game piece. You can't feel sorry for yourself. You can't have excuses. You need to find a path and make it work. Use what little money you have and make it work for you. Do things you don't want to do temporarily to take advantage of the sacrifices you made permanently. The sad reality of it is, this game won't change. 

I'm against slave working. But at the end of the day, work saved my life. Many many 12-15 hour shifts in the hot desert sun. Always keeping my hand raised. Taking all opportunities that came my way and a little ambition changed my life for the better. I work probably 4 hours a week total now and make about 250k a year. I spend my time meeting new people, traveling, making knives, playing video games and most Importantly I do it all with my kids. Making up for lost time ya know?

See you have internalized this idea that to have nice things, you need to work. And it is true, if nobody worked,
society would collapse. The issue is how much do you have to pressure people into working. Is threatening them with
being unimportant members of society, having a very modest livelihood, and little to no chance of realizing their
dreams, enough? I'd argue yes. Of you're offering them a decent career path, without demanding them work 60+
hours a week, without extreme anxiety of losing their jobs or not being able to afford a home, then that should be
enough.

To issue is that reality is much harsher. It's not just being unimportant, it's being literally a nasty homeless person
with no future. To modest livelihood, just extreme poverty slightly alleviate by welfare, usually not even a roof over
your head if you have no one to support you. You not only got no chance at achieving your dreams, but you also get
shunned by people like yourself for not contributing to society.

People should work because they want to, or at least, it should be in fear of becoming nobody, of being a burden on
others, of never doing what they want in life. Threatening them with hopelessness, with social ostracism, or any
other disgusting brutal punishments is going too far.

Now a country treats the homeless is how they treat those who refuse to work under the current circumstances. A
country like Inland that gives their homeless roof and social support knows their work is good, so they don't need
much of a threat to get people to work. A country like the of however couldn't be that nice. It needs to pressure
people into working by all means possible, it needs to throw the homeless into prison, even use spikes and remove
public mountains to punish them magically. It offers jobs that can be so thirty that it needs to make it so there's no

Work should be done at best out of love and at worst out of social responsibility. Not out of fear, not out of threats,
not out of severe social punishment. Work and live a good life, don't work and live a modest, boring, purposeless life
at the expense of the taxpayer. Any country that requires those who don't work to suffer, it's just using them as an
example to get those who do work to accept worse and worse labor conditions. For work to be good, not working

120,Our movement will go nowhere. A few notes from the heat of the battle.,"Only recently did I become part of the workforce, and the prevalent mentality of the people quickly turned out to be a true horrorshow. Workdrones, mindless ants, all of them, not aware of the cage they are in.

Three bothers:

1. People getting angry at the management if there's no opportunity for overtime (so that they can make more money, bruh!). 
2. People considering me a slacker or, God forbid, a richboy, because I sneer at the ""Great Opportunity™"" of being soft-forced to go to work the sixth day in a row, which is overtime, according to local law.

3. A short dialogue I participated in:

\- The other guy: ""It's so great we can work the next saturday. For the bonus (Local Pesos™) I'll earn, I'll be able to buy a better part for the bike I ride to work with""

\- Me: ""So you'll \[waste your weekend to\] ride to work to earn money for a vehicle you need to ride to work with, to earn money?"" 

\- The other guy, slightly dumbfounded, because I used a sentence with more undertones than he's usually used to: ""Uhm, yeah, I have to buy that part I mentioned""

He never got my point.

I was doing very long hours and thought I just don’t want to be here currently and I don’t need more money, I don’t want to buy anything and there is nothing I want and I currently have enough. This dawned on me that I was forced to still be at work regardless of if I wanted the money or not. I couldn’t just not show up because I had enough money at the time. It made me realise when I started my own business that most people cannot understand not working just for the sake of working. Having my own business I can now choose how much I want to work.

132,10 - 7 means I leave at 7:00.,"I work in retail. The amount of times I’ve heard “we’re not leaving till x is finished” is unbelievable and is pisses me off every time. 
Most days the last shifts end at 7pm, and my bus comes at 7:05, meaning I gotta leave pretty quick. Luckily my managers are ok at letting me leave if I say that I gotta catch my bus, but this bullshit notion that we owe them our time by staying longer, and them threatening us with it by saying we’re not leaving till something is done actually infuriates me. 
If my shift is 10 - 7, I shouldn’t have to worry about asking to catch my bus, the SECOND the clock hits 7pm I should be getting my stuff and leaving. 
Oh and now they’ve started doing random searches of employees during our shifts meaning:
They can search me during my shift 
They can search me before I go on my break 
They can search me before I leave (we do this everyday, they pick 3 people, search them at the door and get us to sign to verify it happened).

I got called into HR office today.

HR start off by making same offers the manager made a day after I put in the notice (a promotion, different schedule, etc... but not increase in pay)

I keep shooting them all down. I told the HR my new job pay me roughly $7 more a hour and offer schedule I like.

HR must have thought there was a winning card. Was offered a new schedule. Out of sheer curiosity, I asked what would my pay be like (this place pay rate can wildly range depending on numerous things) HR tried to say it will be “about the same” I wasn’t having it! I laughed and say I’m not taking anything unless it is written including pay rate. 

HR then start to try and say we aren’t going to discuss the pay because that’s against company’s philosophy as we should be focused on well-being of the clients. I start to point out that HR was paid around $65 an hour a few years ago and probably way more now. HR sat there for a moment in silence then say we will pretend I never said that.

I told HR if we can’t discuss pay, I’m out! 

HR then tried again to tell me I’m working there for the wrong reason and I really should think about how the clients would feel to see me leaving.

I replied “just like you and everyone else here, I don’t work out of goodness of my heart”

We just sat there in silence for a minute or so then was told I can go.

Seriously... This completely put me off working for any places where I’m required to care for others! You can pay me to take care of someone... But...  I’m just as shrewd as a fucking prostitute!

167,Work through the pain. You're being lazy.,"Back in 2019 my fiance and I were able to get our first apartment together. It was wonderful until 2020. My fiance had some money form when her father passed away and I was working security at a casino making $9 an hour. We qualified for our appartment and she was going to start a catering job. This lady had a very successful catering service and my fiance who is a certified chef and pastry chef was going to join her. That and my shitty job were enough to make us make ends meet. 

Then covid hit.

All events stopped. The poor lady's catering business went under. Last I heard she was a cashier at a Walmart somewhere. My bad job wasn't gonna cut it. So I busted my ass and found a warehouse job making 18 yes 18 DOLLARS AN HOUR. I was exstatic it was the best pay I've ever received. I was working 12 hour shifts 7 days a week. And STILL couldn't afford a 2 bedroom apartment. It wasnt in a rich area nor did it have any crazy accommodations. I worked so hard a messed my back up. We had to move in with my fiance's mother. All the while I was still commuting an hour to work. When I got to the point I couldn't work anymore people acted like I was crazy to leave a job with high pay and soooo much overtime. H&amp;R and workmen's comp didnt help at all. I didnt qualify since I hadn't been at the job long enough. I worked there for almost a year putting my body through hell. And what do I have to show for it? I broke even. Now we are out if debt but still broke. I followed the rules. Did everything they said to do and still got fucked.

I did agencies for some time, some literary translation too, but they never last long and I got laid off due to the whole field being a shitstorm, basically. So I got used to making ends meet with freelancer work, some of which were from old clients, but many contracted through job-seeking platforms like Upwork. 

If you're not familiar with how these sites operate, it's basically slavery. People would pay me around USD 0.03 for word translated, while the fee range for *entry-level* translators (which I, again, am not. I studied this shit for 4 years, ffs) sits around USD 0.07-0.09. And the people advertising positions on them are the scummiest. In the past few years, I've seen myself working for, among other stuff, data mining companies or random captioning startups dedicated to Instagram celebrities. I didn't sleep, was constantly on the verge of a breakdown. It felt completely purposeless (like all work feel, but worse, as it was so underpaid), and two years ago I decided to enroll in a design undergrad program. Three months in, I realized I couldn't afford it, so I dropped off. 

Fast forward to three months ago, I'm still slaving my early 30s away, this time proofreading textbook questions and answers for [brainly.com](https://brainly.com) (shite site). It pays horribly, but at least there's an almost unlimited influx of texts, so I was putting in 9-10 hours workdays. If I did this for 4-5 months, I thought, I could afford to stop working for a month or two and take care of myself mentally. I was completely devoided of self-esteem, ashamed of myself, being a bad boyfriend, so on. 

Around this time, my sister-in-law, who's been doing some gigs for this big advertising firm, calls me up, asks if I want to fill in for her writing a script for an ad. If I were in any other point in my life, I'd never have accepted, I absolutely loathe advertising, I think it's cancer. But it paid well and it seemed easy enough. I said I'd do it. 

Turns out that the obvious is true, advertising has a lot of money and very little work. And apparently not nearly enough good writers as I've been called back multiple times to work with these people. They praise me. They throw in a couple hundred bucks more than the price we'd settled for a job, just because they liked it. I fucked off all my slavery-like contracts and am working 4-5 hours a day, 5 days a week or less even, while making more and preserving my freelancer-type schedules. The people I deal with are actually cool, around my age, completely accomodating for anything I need. I'm sleeping better, I have stopped gaming, I'm feeling like fucking two times in one night again.

On the other hand, I haven't told anyone but close family about my new gigs. My friends are all struggling with the current political situation of our country (Brazil), as we're all from fields of Humanities and some of them have doctorates and PhDs and can't get a job. These fields were completely defunded and fucked over by our far-right president. So I feel I stopped being one of them now that I feel, well, happy with my work and financial prospects. I feel, basically, like a class traitor.

I'm way past being a full-fledged anarchist, that's the truth. And I was already working for morally dubious companies in the freelancer life. And I know it's stupid not sharing the ad thing with my friends, they all want to see me thrive, and I'll get around to telling them. However I can't help but feel dirty writing these ads full of stereotypes, pandering, phony support for diversity, you know, the usual. I basically lie for a living now, and getting paid well paradoxically worsens things. Seeing my moral compass blown to smithereens hurts, but not as much as surrendering my whole days and putting my mental health on the line for big multinationals and not being paid properly. I guess I sell shit now.",False,ovg2p2,thebigleobowski,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ovg2p2/i_found_a_good_job_but_at_the_cost_of_my_personal/,1,1

171,Go back to the ethics of a Henry Ford mentality...,"Henry Ford put together factories and wanted to pay the workers enough so they could afford the cars that were being produced. Now days these bastard rich ""entrepreneurs"" of today want to make cars using robots and to hell with anyone else on the planet? My question is who is going to buy the cars when they perfect the robots? When robots take over all work and all forms of money disappears what will people such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk do to get ahead then? I guess robots will drive the cars and buy the shit on Amazon. The idea of work is not the problem so much as the greed and selfish goals of Wall Street and the riches it generates.

We know socialism does not work because it offers no incentive to contribute anything to society. If we have socialism people will just try to sit home and play video games. But the games will get old and outdated and there will be no internet before too long since these things require human effort to keep them going and updated. The uber rich are the problem and it is not going to change easily I am afraid. Plus people will have to go out and farm or run a ranch or some such just to have something to eat since butchers and farm workers will be playing video games.

183,Join our dysfunctional family,"A consulting company that used to be part of BCG and after a few decades of losing our bonus to the non performing software arm we have broken away to become our very own dysfunctional chemical and energy consultant nexanteca or some such tosh.
So the bonus remains crap because of the breakaway bit.
So let me tell you about the fast paced world of consulting, not the lying to clients but yea we have a disproportionate amount of people claiming to be engineers who have never set foot in a plant. 
During my early years I remember befriending someone who started at same time after a disagreement with HR they left. Suddenly liz of hr is finding gay porn in his desk and shouting loudly about it. I discovered this was her and all of nexant hr policy to find strange print outs in people’s desks when they leave. Frequently gay porn and dumping similar texts and photos in electronic file archives of past employees , so pull up old files of roger and there we go page after page of strange Porn speech on file.
On top of this idiocy you have politics. Inter regional. And inter office. At the regional level it’s nonsense why no sharing, I understand why the India office was pissed off and sort of whylondon played that game because US workers receive double that of the UK office. India received maybe 20% of what a UK worker earns. So I understand why India would not cooperate and why UK may not but why the US? You have US graduates coming in earning more than UK management. 
So politics is about keeping your job so you have to suck up to management. Those with brownest noses go far further than others.
So this is what happens 
There people I work with have no life outside of work. They live it. HR scum that they are gloat about having spent less on education and being less qualified but having more power than the rest of us.

So now we have left the rest of the team utility and software to become a breakaway consultancy. Same dysfunctional family different name. Still using ihs ( big competitor) data to solve problems for clients and pretending it’s our data.

I thought I was being responsible by booking my appointment for the shot on my day off, and then slogging through the next couple days off work and pushing through the exhaustion and muscle fatigue.

So the next day I ask a coworker about it, and ""Well you didn't hear this from me but..."" and then tells me who I need to speak to to facilitate it. Five minutes later I'm on my way home to actually have a chance to rest.

213,What is your anti-work story?,"I thought it would be nice to share each other's anti-work sentiment.

I had to take a mental health day today or I might have gotten a legit break down. I'm currently 22 turning 23 and for the last couple of months I've come to realize what anti-work really means to me. I've been working since I was 18 in retail for four years in college. I've had to deal with the Karens of the world. I didn't really mind it too much. Going to school, doing my work study, doing internships, going to my retail job. For some reason, this day to day sentiment didn't hit me like a truck.

But then I got my first, full time adult job.

I slowly came to realize what this entailed. Waking up early, going to work, being too tired to do anything after work and just doing the bare minimum of eating and cleaning and upkeep.

Then doing it again the next day, then the next day, then the next day, and then its finally Saturday and you have some time to yourself right? Wrong. Now you gotta go grocery shopping, now you gotta do chores, you gotta take care of the kids (if you have kids), take care of your parents, etc and so fourth.

And then you do it again on Sunday. And then you get the dreaded going back to work on Monday feelings and now it's Monday and you do it all over again dealing with all the things you need to deal with at work.

For the next 50 years of your life.

That literally terrified me. I don't wanna live like this for the next 50 years of my life. And I don't know how people before me were able to do this for the entirety of their lives and retire in their 60s.

I ask around the people in my life and they say to just suck it up and this is how life is, and if that's the case I don't want this shit.

And then if you want to get out of the rat race, not wanting to work for someone else because they'll ultimately fuck you over somehow someway, you have the option to make a businesss of your own, and that has its own pros and cons but at the end of the day you're still working. You're still working towards that end goal, whatever it may be. And I'm TIRED of it, I'm only 22 and I'm TIRED of it.

I can't go to the dotor or dentist because I'm working my 9-5, and most doctors and dentists are open at that time. So if I need my annual checkup I have to take PTO. Have to do all my grocery shopping after work where everybody else also has to do it at that time as well. My parents are aging and they're not able to move around as much as they want to, and I can't help them out cause I'm at work, and my younger 18 year old sister can't help out because she's moderately intellectually disabled.

Do this useless task, do that useless task, did you see \[insert useless detail here\] what can we do to change it to \[insert other useless detail here\].  

The Middle Management Idiot uncritically accepts whatever the corporation tells him or her. Tell employees to go back to office during a pandemic? The Middle Management Idiot will harangue employees to do so. Doesn't matter if they don't work with anybody in the office.

The Middle Management Idiot creates new work through their sheer incompetence. Massive Data upload to new system? Assign it to the intern. Intern fucks up, Middle Management Idiot acts surprised. 

Middle Management Idiot doesn't think very deeply. Middle Management Idiot doesn't realize the foolishness of working so hard, well beyond normal business hours, for a place where he doesn't have equity. 

Not so enthusiastic about useless meetings, useless busy work, and hurrah enthusiasm like the Middle Management Idiot? She has her eyes on you.

I've no perspective on this personally, but I do wonder how the statistics of how many annual sick days are recorded change because of this new working from home 'thing'

I can just imagine an employee calling in and saying:

 *""I'm unwell today, is slept awfully*""

And their boss saying something like:

 *""Oh, but can't you just turn your laptop on and get something done anyway, you can shift your hours around a bit?""* 

Then they mark this as a normal workday instead of a sick day, then of course you'd always be expected to do this

How would you guys respond to something like this, would you have the courage to fight your corner or would you agree to log on and 'look busy' whilst genuinely not feeling great?

I don't know (or really want) to just accept company policies. I just want to be left alone, both in work and my private life. When I go in for a job, I want to be given a task, do that task, and just be trusted to do it. I can't fucking deal with people because they require too much attention.

So, I work at a nonprofit. I won't say which one, but it's in the field of caring for people with developmental disabilities. And they rely very heavily on Government funding. We do a lot of great work there, but the amount of funding the Government gives them isn't enough, and trying to raise the minimum wage is likely to cut jobs in the maintenance or business departments. (You can't cut DSPs and teachers because you need to maintain a certain ratio of participants to staff.) That is, of course, unless we also rally for these places to receive more funding and resources to better support the people they care for. I probably sound like a shill, but I mean it. This place can be esoteric and inefficient at times, and I'm not always pleased with the business side of the organization, but I do believe in helping the people my workplace cares for.

Essentially instead of hiring more people for other departments to relieve capacity issues, they are using me and my team to do the job without compensation. Fuck that.

I just wanted to provide a friendly reminder to know what rights and protections you have under ADA (the American Disability Act). A lot of mental illnesses are covered under ADA which sounds like what a lot of people on this page are going through. As long as you are officially diagnosed, employers legally must not discriminate against you and provide “reasonable accommodations” which can include an improved work settings, reduction in non-essential work tasks, flexible schedule for things such as doctors appointments or therapy appointments, no required overtime (especially if you’re a salaried employee and don’t get paid for for overtime), and sometimes even flexible/remote or part time remote work situations. You do have rights that can improve your work situations and if your employer doesn’t reasonably accommodate you, you can sue (sometimes even just threatening to sue someone is enough). Know your rights and look into ADA. I could have made my life and work a lot easier and healthier had I realized this earlier.

278,Quitting work for good after 2 horrible years,"I'm 25. I just found this amazing sub. I've been seriously thinking about quitting my job for good and stop working as soon as possible and would like advice from this community.

I'm a Mexican immigrant in the us with a visa. I managed to get a CS degree though scolarships in Mexico as my family never had much to go arround. I spent uncountable years maintaining very good grades and being the best of my class in order to get a good paying job (mistake).

When I finaly got somewhere to work in the US after finishing college, I was out of my mind, I was sure I couldn't be happier.
Fast forward 2 years... And I hate it. The amount of stress is insane. Work doesn't end. My team develops critical worldwide services and sometimes something breaks at 3am and you have to run to the computer and spend several hours fixing it. Then you start working again without sleep as the work day starts again. 

I'm burned. I'm exhausted to death. And I'm supposed to do this shit until I'm 70?! Fuck no.

I have a lower than median Software Engineer salary because I'm not in California, $120k, my total compensation last year was $260k. Though saving and investing + living below means, I've managed to save arround $500k this 2 years. I don't know if I should go back to Mexico and live like a king for the rest of my life or wait for residency and stay in the US. I don't know if I can tolerate this job any longer. 

Can I just live from investments with 500k in the us? Or do I need to stay in hell for longer? According to (levels.fwi) I might just need to hold 3 years more to make 300k+ a year. But even that amount of money has no value compared to the biblical proportions of stress and destruction of my life, hobbies and family this job is doing.

I’ve seen some bad posts on here, but I always thought “my company is different, this has never happened at my company”.

Then recently I had a conflict with my boss and everything I thought about this job is a lie. 

And before you say I’m a bad worker, I’m not. All my performance reviews have been exceeding expectations. 

Basically I feel dumb for falling for it and actually believing my company was better than the “other companies” because they give us benefits, 401k, and other nice benefits.",False,ouqadq,TAA559,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ouqadq/i_feel_disillusioned_with_my_job/,4,1
310,Delayed healthcare...,"So I admit that I’m somewhat of a workaholic, despite my disdain for the entire capitalist system. As a result of my years of labor, I was recently seen as fit to be hired by a bigger and better company than the one I’d worked for previously. Cool, right? Little more money, a more humane work environment, and so on. And that’s all great.

But you know what’s absolutely stupid? As I’m sure everyone else here has experienced, one of my “rewards” for being hired by a new company is having to wait three fucking months for my health insurance to kick in. What the fuck? So I’m left paying $300/month out of pocket for three months of woefully inadequate “major medical” coverage, while working 12-hour shifts for my new employer- which are high-stress and high-liability- but not receiving health insurance from them. What the fuck?

Health coverage should start when you’re hired, period. It shouldn’t be, “OK, we’ll take advantage of your KSAs for three months, but if you fall in your shower and break a leg during that time, well, that’s unfortunate but you’re on your own.” 

Even in capitalistspeak, trading one’s labor for some sort of compensation seems fair; I give you labor so you can make profit, and you give me wages and benefits so I can “profit” by living reasonably comfortably. A two way road, right?

Healthcare shouldn’t be tied to employment or profit in the first place, but even in a world where it is, employees should be covered the day they begin work. What a joke. We need reform.",False,ou0w16,AbleTourist6,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ou0w16/delayed_healthcare/,10,1

316,Are we more self aware or are we wired differently?,"Do you think being anti work or on the anti work spectrum takes a certain self awareness? 

In the past I’ve often talked about and/or asked people how they felt working the typical 9-5 Corp America type job. It seems like 99.9% percent of the time they would look at me like I was crazy haha I have one close friend that gets it.

For example, I worked  at this giant insurance company that has offices worldwide for a little over two years. The “culture” there is the typical corporate work the worker to the bone. Although there were many things that irked me about my experience there, way too many to go into now, one of the worst for me personally was forced OT on almost a daily basis! There was a lot of work and not enough workers (typical); even though, the CEO of said company gets in the ballpark of $17 million US dollars in compensation a year while they often hired workers right out of college for 35k a year which does not go far in the Los Angeles area. 

The intriguing thing for me was that people did not really seem to mind the forced OT and not knowing how long they would have to work that day! Workers would start between 7-8 am and not leave until 8pm or later. They would also want people to come in on Saturdays too.  I would often ask coworkers how they felt about this. I would hear things like that’s life, they were getting that bread, some seemed to have no life and just liked being in the office, while many didn’t seem to care about or were completely unaware about how they were being exploited. I had one guy warn me and tell me to run ASAP and that they would work you to death. He quit not long after that convo, good for him! My other coworkers would often seem happy to do it because they were “on that grind” and getting that “bread.” Others I had a feeling were trying to suck up to management or paint themselves as a team player in order to move up the ladder and get that promotion and become a cog in the machine. This place was a revolving door and people often left for the above mentioned reasons. So maybe there are more anti workers out there, but a lot of people did stay and are still there years later.

This has been one of my many job experiences that I’m still trying to understand and process…..I guess what I’m getting at is do you think we are a little more self aware than others or just wired differently?

320,From reverend insanity,"“Must a mere class monitor and two vice-class monitor positions got them
itching their fists. Now hot-blooded and naive they are at this age,"" Sang Juan
sneered as he leaned against the gateway of the academy.

The so-called glory was just a valuable tool the upper levels used to motivate
those below them. In the end, it was just a layer of illusionary glory, it was

useless!

His five hundred years of experience had long allowed Sang Juan to understand

some of the secrets of life.

“Whether it comes to a clan, sect or demon group, whether it is this world or
earth, all organizations are like this. The high and low positions are established,
making the law of promotion clear, letting those in the organization climb up
non-stop from the bottom. Because chasing after profit is the nature of humans,
and positions of authority often make people have superiority, creating the
illusion that oneself is living a more valuable life than others.""
“Power is like the carrot dangling in front of a donkey. The desires of humans
are stimulated by it, and each of them secure their personal gains with someone
with authority for it. After climbing up one level, there will be a higher level.
While they are busy carrying favour for personal gain, their hard work is
squeezed out from them and their value is exploited by the upper position.""

“In every organization, as long as there is a chain of command, it is to give serve
to those at the upper ranks. The so-called class monitor and vice-class monitor
position is like the smallest carrot, luring everyone else into the structure of the
clan. And to stop those below from realizing the truth, those at the higher
positions integrate shared values, clear-cutting the idea of glory, meritorious
deeds etc. The establishment of high and low positions are made along with
unequal benefits. Sometimes the use of religion is done to dominate people's

hearts.""

“His is the real truth, yet it is a pity that too many people in the world do not

understand; they foolishly work hard for others. And for every organization in
the world, the most fundamental of its essence is just one thing, and that is—
The redistribution of resources, where the higher the position the more

resources they can enjoy.""

342,The coming Great Reset is directly analogous to Marx's immiseration thesis,"https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/

The notion that ""you will own nothing and be happy"" has a direct antecedent in Marx, who anticipates this as the final world structure before global Communist revolution- in particular, he acknowledges this to be the case in an early work of 1845, *The German Ideology*.

&gt; For it to become an “intolerable” power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity “propertyless,” and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development.

The rationale for the reset is simple; offset the climate crisis onto the shoulders of the proletariat, thereby justifying their immiseration (which would occur anyway - it is the nature of capitalism to strip property from the proletariat) whilst leaving the bourgeoisie unscathed.

This process will be presided over, ironically, by the bourgeois *Left*, whom Marx constantly scathed for justifying the perpetual existence of capitalism through their rhetoric. The conservatives fear of ""eat bug, live in pod"" are wholly justified, but his solutions will be ineffective - the struggle against it will by necessity have to be converted into a global struggle of the proletariat.",False,ou75cf,Trick-Quit700,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ou75cf/the_coming_great_reset_is_directly_analogous_to/,8,1

Then when one guy tried to storm out of the place the boss shot him and then he shouted back at us “so I killed one worker and that just means that the rest of you will have to pick up his slack!” and one by one a co-worker would try to escape and our boss would shoot them dead.

349,"Just Joined, 20, living on my own, feeling lost.","I wouldn't call myself lazy, and I don't think I'd say I'm properly antiwork either, but I feel burnt out as all hell. This is a vent post. I'm a guy, and I've always dreamed of having a family, being a dad, and spending lots of time writing stories and being with my kids. At my age my parents were married and had my oldest brother, my dad was and still is working his dream job, and after years working in the field my dad is just now getting to be considered stable middle class.

I've always told myself I'd be fine with a job I don't care about so long as it pays well and I get to have time to write. Most other people in the country do the same, so why can't I? I don't really have a dream job. If anything, my dream job would be ""dad."" My girlfriend has a dream job in mind and she is close to getting it, but if I choose to be a house-husband society deems me a failure and also I get the cops called on me for daring to be a man spending time with children. (That's already happened when I've been a baby sitter for people.) 40 hours a week means when I get home I don't have the energy to write, weekends are laundry, cleaning, and cooking for a week of meals. Every two weeks I have a day of DnD online with some friends, that's nice.

I moved out to have independence, to prove I can handle the world and sustain myself. Which I can do financially and physical, but emotionally it is hard. I'm in a LDR going strong for 4 years, but with the pandemic I haven't seen her in over a year and a half.

354,Life will always be more important,"Venting to the people of the internet today to spare my girlfriend the headache of listening to me.

Not sure if this is the exact right spot to share this, I'm brand new to the sub. But I believe that many will share the sentiment. Hope I'm welcomed here because you all seem great.

I'm a hard working dude living in Canada. Always have been. I didn't do overly phenomenal in school, but from the time I first started working at 15 years old to now, just under 10 years later, I've busted my ass and tried every damn shift to show a good work ethic through a diverse amount of jobs. What I wanna know is, what the fuck is it for? 

I now am in a position (not even retail) where I work 12 hours a day, and only get paid for 8 of them (banked time, forced to sign OTA agreement so that company can save money), work on weekends, holidays, etc, for shit pay, ZERO benefits, and horrifically laughable treatment. I've been with this company for almost 5 years and I've worked 4 Christmas Days including Christmas Eve. The only reason I didn't work the previous Christmas is because I was fed up with seeing my spouse sad that I am missing out so I called in sick. They told me I had to come in anyway, and I said no. During a performance review I was recommended for sizeable raise over 2 years ago. Since then I have referenced this in emails over 3 times while even CCing our company's general manager, all to be told the same fucking answer: ""No"" or ""We don't have the budget"" all the while inflation is literally preventing me from making a living wage due to our fucked up government who just wants to do nothing but print more money and destroy my province's economy even further.

I'm not anti Capitalism, so maybe I'm an outlier here. I understand that in order for it to exist it needs a lower class to beat on, which sucks, but I believe it's the lesser of many evils compared to things like Communism or Socialism. I have a job here and I make money and I'm not starving or trying to leave the country on a piece of floating cardboard (Well, not yet anyway.)

That being said, even I can look at myself in the mirror and say what the fuck is the point of *literally* killing myself for a job (I routinely get only about 4-5 hours of sleep a night, it will fucking age you...) where I'm treated like shit and wage-slaving while I work unpaid overtime to make sure millionaires are safe within compliance and can save their money, while they cut my departments budget so that they can go on tropical vacations while I have to fucking lie and risk my job just to be able to see my girlfriend on her Birthday? Or see her on Christmas? I looked in the mirror and asked myself, dark circles under my eyes, making my girlfriend upset at 5am while leaving for work because I was frustrated and irritable from how sleep deprived I've been, how much longer can I really take? How many more Birthdays, Christmases, Vacations, and life experiences am I willing to miss? How much more can I be lied to and havr the carrot dangled in front of my face, having my 20s stolen from me?

I'm done. Life and happiness and mental health will always be more important. It may be a foolish decision given the economic climate but I'm not going to be showing up for my shift this weekend, instead, I'm attending a party that me and my girlfriend were invited to, before our friends just stop fucking inviting us. I'm fortunate enough to have done a few smart things despite my evidently blatant inability to not be manipulated by my employer, and I have investments that I can fall back on in an emergency. Who knows. Maybe I'm one of those guys who getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them, but I can't focus on that right now because I'm just too God damn tired.

Even if nobody reads this, typing this out instead of just dwelling with it helped me out a lot, so thank you.

356,When do problems start and then they never seem to end in a group of people,"Let's take things from the beginning to explain my theory...

  

What is a Theory? 

Sum up your observations, and if they REALLY happen again and again, that is a theory that seems to be happening for real.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do people have to do experiments: 

When within a group of people, people are wondering about something, they have to do experiments to find out the answer, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, people are wondering about something, they don’t have to do experiments to find out the answer, but then if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

If in the end, when within a group of people, people are wondering about something, they don’t have to do experiments to find out the answer, it doesn’t seem to me that they have to be wondering…does it seem to you…?

&amp;#x200B;

When do problems start, and then they never seem to end? 

This happens when people forget, who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, who KNOW what they are talking about, and who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about…especially if they do that within a group of people, when experiments …HAVE TO be done.

So …how do people remember the above?

&amp;#x200B;

Who are those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about?

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they don’t know what they are talking about, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they know what they are talking about, but then if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

If in the end, when within a group of people, experiments have to be done, and out of all the people in the group, those who THINK THEY KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they know what they are talking about, then it doesn’t seem to me that there is something someone doesn’t know in this group, for which experiments have to be done…does it seem to you…?

Excellent…you are learning…keep reading…

&amp;#x200B;

Who are those who KNOW what they are talking about?

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who KNOW what they are talking about, are those who know to wait until they talk, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who KNOW what they are talking about, are those who don’t know to wait until they talk, but if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

If in the end, when within a group of people, experiments have to be done, and out of all the people in the group, those who KNOW what they are talking about, are those who don’t know to wait until they talk, it doesn’t seem to me that those ones specifically are wondering about something, for which experiments have to be done…does it seem to you…?

…keep going…the last step is the strangest…

&amp;#x200B;

Who are those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about?

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they know what they are doing, because if you REALLY think otherwise…

When within a group of people, experiments have to be done, out of all the people in the group, those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they don’t know what they are doing, but if you think this is REALLY ok for you…

IF in the end, when within a group of people, experiments have to be done, and out of all the people in the group, those who DON’T KNOW what they are talking about, are those who the rest think they don’t know what they are doing, it doesn’t seem to me that those who REALLY DON’T KNOW what they are doing, are not doing experiments, because the rest people notice this also, neither that the rest people can tell the ones who REALLY DON’T KNOW what they are doing, what they have to do, because they REALLY DON’T KNOW what they are talking about and the rest people notice that also…

…does it seem to you…?

&amp;#x200B;

Because if it does, how else do you think one can within a group of people doing experiments think, while reality is something else than what you can imagine?

Why? Because reality is REALLY happening, and you REALLY don't imagine reality for reality to happen, you can just imagine per case how reality REALLY happens...",False,ousvnv,AlexandrosTsolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ousvnv/when_do_problems_start_and_then_they_never_seem/,2,1
357,The other story about money,"We are doing the following thought experiment in the steps described below, with some instructions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

instructions have to be followed for the experiment to be completed, or else you are not really considering what is written below...

&amp;#x200B;

...so if that is the case for you, and you didn't follow the instructions below,

&amp;#x200B;

please don't waste our time and effort with your reply about something, that you could have posted as a subject on its own elsewhere...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1.Imagine that you do something,

instructions 1: feel free to imagine, following the steps and instructions below from beginning until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

follow the instructions from beginning until the end, and don't waste my time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2.You do this something that you imagine in two different ways from its beginning until its end

instructions 2: you can come back to me with two stories, each with a beginning and and end, about something done in two different ways from its beginning until its end.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

Two stories that start and end, don't waste my time and effort, and follow the instructions from beginning until the end.

Where the instruction don't limit you, there you are free to imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3.First you do it with money from its beginning until its end

\*instructions 3:\*Trade is happening in the first story with money.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

This means that, either you do something for another, and another gives the agreed amount of money to you,

or another does something for you, and you give another the agreed amount of money to another...and the agreed amount of money...

is the amount of money you and another...agreed in order to trade.

&amp;#x200B;

Example...

Why the below is provided as an example, in case it offends you, you will find out in number 4.

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. prostitution is legal in the place where this example...takes place, and you or another give money to the other other one in exchange for sex.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4.Secondly you do it without money from its beginning until its end

\*instructions 4:\*Trade is happening in the second story without money.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

This mean that, you do this for another and another does that for you, this and that is whatever it is for the specific occasion and instance, and money isn't involved between the two of you, in the second story.

&amp;#x200B;

Also this means that the stories you can come back to me are one story with trade and money

and the other story also with trade but without money...so follow the instructions, and don't waste my time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Example...

And now time has come to find out why prostitution was discussed in number 4, with the following example.

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. you and another have sex, and money isn't involved in this example.

You and another freely chose to have sex with one another, and freely chose not to use money.

Why this example is used in number 5., you will find out in number 6.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

5. For the second way when you do it without money, you have to spend less time and effort to do it, from its beginning until its end

\*instructions 5:\*In the first story when you do it with money, you have to spend more time and effort to do it, from its beginning until its end

&amp;#x200B;

Example...

Time to find out the difference between 4. and 5. with the following example.

e.g. You have sex with another, another is your partner in life, and after sex...

having heard that that money's means , store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account...

you decide to give to another, who is your partner in life, after you had sex with one another...money...

so as to show the value of another to you, for the exchange that took place, with a real unit of account...

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think another would do, especially if you were a man and another was a woman...and you gave to a woman who was your partner in life, money after having sex with her, in order to thank her for having sex with you?

&amp;#x200B;

Still unconvinced?.. ok, let's move one...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

6. I wonder would you say you are using your money wisely?

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

follow the instructions from beginning until the end, and don't waste my time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

7. Because if you would, wait a minute before you start replying, and listen to me.

&amp;#x200B;

In both stories that you can come back to me, you are trading with another.

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the stories, you have to spend more time and effort, to do what you freely imagined you do with another, plus you have to also use money on top of having to spend more time and effort to do it, unlike the way you do it in the other story.

&amp;#x200B;

In the other story, you have to spend less time and effort, to do what you freely imagined you do with another, and as you also have to not use money in the second story, you don't have to spend time and effort to use money, unlike the way you do it in one of the stories.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

8. So it seems to me that the other story, and not one of the stories, is what you would be looking for...if it seems sensible to you to spend less time and effort, and not get caught up in one of those stories...you know the ones I'm talking about, no?.. if not, I am talking about one of the stories where you have to spend endless time and effort even for the simplest of things.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, I don't understand the above, what's the summary?"", one may ask.

Money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications for the ""I still don't understand"" one.

When one is wasting one's money, it is up to that one to find this out in the end for oneself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. When the way one uses money increases the time and effort one has to spend to do what one wants to do, one is wasting either one's money, or another one's money, or the rest one's money.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications for the ""I don't understand, and I am offended"" one.

&amp;#x200B;

When one is wasting another one's money, another one doesn't want to waste another one's time and effort, and tries to avoid trading with one, and trades...with another one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. And in the end, how all have to remember the above, is...

&amp;#x200B;

When some are wasting the rest of our money, it is up to the rest of us to show to some that we don't want some to be wasting our time and effort with their endless nonsense stories about what money does, because...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another,

or people are wasting each other's time and effort spending their money...

...and then they have the nerve to call what they are doing trading with one another

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Up to now, some people don't know how to not waste one another's time and effort, it seems to me,

&amp;#x200B;

and they add money on top of that, as if that would make their case better...

&amp;#x200B;

... how about they put some time and effort thinking now, so that they don't end up wasting our time and effort, because money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another.",False,outa51,AlexandrosTsolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/outa51/the_other_story_about_money/,7,1

373,Calling all whom are ready to take a stand against capitalist oppression!,"After hanging around this sub for over a year, I can see and understand the sentiment now. 

I am a member of the International Marxist Tendancy (IMT). We are a worldwide socialist organization working to end capitalism through the unity of working people like you. We believe that the only way forward for the future of the world is for workers to stand united against the bourgeois corporate owners that run and control our lives. We cannot trust the politicians and their false promises as they are all lapdogs to the corporations. Day by day we are forced to live a life to which we toil in misery and expend ourselves while the rich profit off our exploitation! You all know this already, I need not say more!

During the past year in 2020 alone, the IMT has grown vastly worldwide. Its members consist of all working people just like you and me ready to take a stand against this rotten system! We work from anything towards supporting progressive movements to participations in union strike actions. We are non-sectarian meaning we are not hung up on petty squabbles or minor disagreements, our goal is to unite the working class in a common struggle so any movement or demand that benefits workers we will support. Our goal is to push for the overthrow of capitalism through worker's revolutionary action, such as general strikes, and to create a new system based on people's needs and a governing system based off democratic worker's control. As of right now, we are active in over 47 countries and growing exponentially.

Let me ask you, now. Are you looking to be part of a  force to finally make the changes you wish to see? Are you ready to put an end to this rotten capitalist system? I ask you consider joining us in this fight!

378,Fly on the wall in a Japanese domestic company,"Torture of the day: A meeting with the managers 

They call me and my American college in individually and ask why we are taking so long getting coffee (because apparently anything other than standing mutely in front of the machine, grabbing the cup, and then sprinting back to your desk, is unacceptable). 
Apparently, heaps of people are asking them questions such as ‘what are they talking about, standing over there?’ 
(First point- how the fuck do those randoms know who manages us, why do they care, why do they feel the need to SNITCH like fucking plague rat bastards)
And as managers, they feel like they have to answer the randoms and tell them exactly what we are saying, and it’s embarrassing for them not to know. 
Standing and talking next to the coffee machine means your hands aren’t moving on a keyboard, which means you aren’t doing work. If you stand and talk for over five minutes, it means you don’t have enough work to do, it means you’re too free. 
If you are talking about work during that time, don’t stand, instead talk at your desk (where the whole team sits in perpetual silence, listens to everything, and all eyes swivel your way if you so much stand up to go to the toilet. Every movement is monitored). 
If you have problems with work or if you are talking about work, you shouldn’t talk about it with each other, you should talk about it with your superiors or in a place where your superiors can hear you. 

Also, during the morning meetings, we expect you to clap along with everyone when an order is completed, otherwise we think you aren’t excited about the order. 

If this damn place wasn’t supporting my visa, I’d be out of there so fast.... as it is, I’m basically tuning into a high functioning alcoholic in an attempt to cope with this insanity. 
I am attached to being in Japan, but I’m beginning to question it as job hunting isn’t going anywhere... it’s very difficult to even think about making a choice to go back to my home country. I love exploring here and love the nature, all the stuff I didn’t care for back home... I have an attachment to Japan that I never had to anything or anywhere before... but work is grinding me into the dust every single day.

And the kicker: this company is very highly rated on Japanese workplace review sites online as a ‘progressive’ workplace.

379,Some good news for me,"So I've been applying to fire departments in the region since I got all my certifications done recently. The problem is that it's an insanely competitive career and so you have a ton of people trying out for a very limited number of open positions. I'm talking 2-3 slots at a time with anywhere from 300-800 applicants. I digress though, since I'm seeking employment elsewhere while applying to as many departments as I can.

I landed a job at a party supply business right around the corner, literally within 3 minutes of where I live. I could skateboard/bike/walk to work and not even break a sweat. I've been looking for jobs similar to what I've had in the past, which is mostly driving and delivery, so this is par for the course. They make about $500k a month in season, and I'd be paid $16 an hour starting. 

The interview was typical: ""we're looking for the outgoing type, you really gotta treat this job like your life depends on it. This isn't just a 9-5, this is a \*full-time\* gig"". The lady really drove home the fact that I'd have to be available at all hours of the day since rental equipment would need to be delivered and retrieved at any time. What got me was that she told me that sometimes I'd be delivering 4-5 hours away from home, and I might need to stay in a hotel from time to time... after telling her that I have a 6 month old baby. She also told me that they're looking for about 25 drivers for the season since they laid off most of them last year. I told her that I'd really need about $18 an hour for something so demanding but that was quickly ignored.

So I took the job, did the pee test, and I start tomorrow. This lady even had the nerve to call me at 8pm tonight to remind me of the time that I'd need to be there. I immediately think to myself ""this is the kind of place that's gonna hound me off the clock"".

So they're expecting me at 10am tomorrow. 

What they don't know is that I called a good friend of mine shortly after that lady called me, to catch up with him... and he offered me $19 an hour to work with/under him instead. He said he goes fishing on his lunch break. We can talk bluegrass and country music since we're both musicians. I can finally look forward to working since I'll have a friend with me.

I immediately took the position. I can now afford to keep paying for an overpriced apartment. I'm still struggling, but this is literally the best news I've had in a long, long while. 

I didn't tell this company that they're gonna need to find someone else. They can go suck an egg.",False,otptg8,zappipapi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/otptg8/some_good_news_for_me/,0,1

382,I'm so done.,"So I'm typing this from my night job, which I recently was recalled to after 16 months of covid related layoff. My hours here are 10pm-6am. I've been mulling over in my head for the last half hour emailing in sick to my day job, which I started about 2 months ago. It's a corporate environment, and as you would expect we started off working from home- only to be called to start reporting to the office 3 weeks ago by an overzealous branch manager (we had initially been told to expect to come back after Labour day, and that is still the companies ""goal""). So I've been working 2 full time jobs for 3 weeks. Why? Well because my night job told me I might not be full time when I was recalled, only to start scheduling me full time that very week. I can't drop to part time- they have been clear if we don't like the terms of our recalled positions, we are welcome to take a hike. 

I was mentally phrasing out an email in my mind to tell the honest truth- after 3 days of split-shift training for the day job (classes from 9-12, then 530-930pm), I'm utterly exhausted even more so then would be expected working 2 jobs. I can't drive safely, I can barely keep my eyes open, and my spine feels like a bent and rusty piece of rebar. And it struck me that my day boss simply won't care. Sure, there's a good chance I'll get the day off- probably told to cash in a vacation day rather then a sick. But regardless, it will forever become a black mark for ""the management"" to hold against me.

 ""That doesn't show great work ethic"" ""He's not a team player!"" 

The company I work for by day can come off as near-fanatical sometimes with all the slogans and ""initiatives"" we are expected to know and pretend to care about, to say nothing of the borderline worship of random bureaucratic figures within the company itself. My record there in the short time I have worked for them is not stellar- I was told off for leaving an hour early one day, and was late last week (overslept an hour while trying to nap between jobs). It would probably be an overreaction to claim my boss has something out for me, but she's the type of person to focus heavily on this type of thing and expect work to be our top priority. 

To switch topics a bit, I've had 9 jobs since I was laid off due to covid in March 2020. Each of them sucked in their own unique and painful way, but the grass is always greener and so I kept moving along. I came out of last year with a pile of debt, a car in need of major repairs, and just this total lack of motivation. Working 2 jobs is just barely going to let me pay off those debts in the next month, but I want out now. I want to quit both, just drive all day for doordash, which is work I actually don't mind- if not for the fatal flaw that short of working 12+ hours a day, it simply does not pay enough to live on- sometimes, not enough to break even on gas. 

This is a whole twisted up rant but I just need to get it off my chest. I feel like my family and friends are  rightly tired of hearing me complain about my work- but I just need something to give here. I'm going to email my manager now and tell them I'm having the day off tomorrow, and when I wake up in the late afternoon, try and figure out which job to quit as a first step towards a marginally healthier work life balance.

Considering that her mental health challenges were causing her to feel disorientated in the air she had a risk of getting a life-changing injury if she landed on her neck or did some damage to her spine. Why is she expected to sacrifice not only her mental health but also the only body she will ever have, that could get permanently damaged for a JOB?

She has already won gold medals for the US, she's literally reached the peak of being an athlete and got to the highest position you can get. What more do the pathetic cheerleaders of capitalism want? Are we supposed to just work no matter what even after we've become the best of the best?

For him, work gave him purpose and identity. He's a classic ""boot straps"" kind of guy who didnt have much higher education but could sell water to a fish. He would regularly work 12 hour days, skip vacations, and generally carry the stress of work with him at home. To compensate, like many middle class men, he exercised religiously, ate healthy, took vitamins, didnt drink and didnt smoke. I've had people mistake him for my brother regularly and when he played in an over 50 baseball league he would get ID'ed by organizers who didnt believe he was as old as he said. 

Well we just found out he has significant arterial build up due to occupational stress. His cardiologist said it looked like he had PTSD and despite looking like a 40 year old his heart was in the state of someone in their late 70s. For sure some of this is hereditary but the two doctors he spoke agreed that occupational stress was the root cause. And that if he wasn't such an exercise freak he would've been dead already. 

I don't have much of a broader point here than fuck work. The meat grinder of capital will use and consume even it's most loyal foot soldiers.

399,"New here, but I feel stuck financially","I read most of that first article that we see when we first come to the page. I was referred over here by a fellow redditor! 

So I’m a server, recently graduated college in Dec. 2019 with a degree in music theory/composition. Music has been my passion for as long as I remember. Just to lay some groundwork, I also still live with my mom and it’s just her and I. I’ll be 26 in November. 

I do “work” a lot on my craft as a musician and it definitely is work, but it’s also my passion and it’s the kind of work that brings meaning to my life intellectually, mentally, emotionally, just unfortunately not financially. I did teach music for a few years  but it was just private lessons for someone’s piano studio at 15$/hr an hour and the hours were very inconsistent and that’s extremely low pay for an area of specialization like music. I’ve also made about $600 dollars from winning composition contests, but nothing sustainable. 

I’ve never worked full time serving tables but given my current expenses with student loans and my new car payment (old car engine blew out) and various other expenses (insurance, phone, etc) I would still barely scrape by living on my own and it would put that creative passion which brings so much fulfillment to my life on the back burner. Not only that I feel like I’d have to live in a very sketchy part of town to afford rent and it’d be a really run down place causing my quality of life to go down overall. 

I wanna flourish and grow and not live with my mom lol but I’ve felt stuck for awhile. COVID definitely didn’t help, and my degree is also basically useless in terms of getting a job.... I’d have to get my doctorates essentially. Maybe I just need to change my perspective.

I could be wrong on being able to afford to move out it just seems like a huge stretch given everything going on in my life. I’m also fairly introverted and reclusive, I enjoy to explore inwardly rather than be super social. I enjoy social interaction but it really drains me which makes serving sometimes a very difficult job for me. I’ve also asked some friends who I trust if they would want to get a place together (lived with a roommate once for about a year), but they either don’t want to or aren’t able to for similar reasons

I’ve just felt stuck financially for awhile. My goal is to be financially free by doing music and making that my source of income. 

Sorry this has turned into a rant of sorts but this seems like a good place where people might be able to offer advice or at least relate and sympathize with me.

408,I Got Covid At Work,"And found out yesterday morning, after walking 2 miles to work, showing up basically dieing, because nobody I work with or for told me anybody had covid, I get to work dieing, confused, sick as a dog, asking where my coworkers are. An hour into my shift I finally get told that at least 2 people have covid, that number is 4-5 confirmed now, and the whole time my boss was trying to tell me its not that bad and that if I wear a mask and distance from customers I should be fine to work. I told him no, left, went to the er. 

On top of covid I have a cyst on my brain, and currently have a sinus infection so bad that I'm bleeding out of my nose and when I move my head i can feel fluid and pressure, and the whole time in complaining about this infection in my head, my coworkers are telling me I'm fine, while at the Same time failing to tell me that the previous two weeks, at least 1 employee has called of sick. 

Should i quit? What should i do. I'm a recovering drug addict, I just moved to this new state, got a new job, I'm doing everything right, and everything inside of me is telling me I have no reason to quit and it's not a big deal, but everyone else is telling me to quit and stop feeling so bad and worried about people disliking me or judging me based on my decision.

411,Why experienced people resent their job (rant),"Have you guys ever applied for a job but got offered another position instead? If I could blurt out what the F...to their face, I would.

Employer “It’s the same pay but I think you are best fit for this role”. Ugh...no. You don’t know what’s best for me, only I know what is best for me. It is the same industry, same pay but different field of work. 

The employer has sponsored training for both positions. I applied for position B because that’s what I really wanted. It’s not necessarily a change in industry but I see it as a new road for my career path. Instead I got offered position A which is similar to what burned me out on the last company I worked for. 

If they want to improve employee retention, then they should start by recognizing employee resentment. Step 1, stop playing matchmaker and give them the job they want. 

Sometimes the position offered will work out in the long run and end up being better for your future. But spare me the fairytale.

It absolutely makes me cringe when my manager tells me he sees everyone as a 'friend.' And when various people in my team refer to the rest as 'family.'

One colleague in particular, address all emails as 'hi work fam!' I know it's really petty of me but it really rubs me up the wrong way.

All I can think is that we work for two different companies with two different sets of people.

Where I work, we're not treated as people. We are treated as a number. People will stab each other in the back to get ahead. The managers will shove their work at you and screw you over during appraisals just so they can give more money to their 'favourites.' Office politics are a massive thing.

Like go through the craziest mental gymnastics to justify it. But for the most of us we know it’s archaic and needs to go. What’s up with so many office jobs nowadays being non-exempt (hourly)? Back in the 70s the 9-5 existed. Lunch was included in your 8 hours. Then at some point companies turned it into the 9-5:30/6 and everyone just let it happen. Seriously I’ve asked older coworkers who were working back then what happened and even they scratch their heads. They remember it and can’t remember when it went away. Being paid hourly only makes sense for certain jobs. For example, a cashier is paid hourly because they’re paid to spend time at the register just in case someone comes in to purchase something. Makes sense. Makes sense for nurses. Doesn’t make sense for most office jobs. I’m sick of companies using it as an excuse to run skeleton crews and justify everyone needing to be there for 8 hours every single day. I’ve heard from some German coworkers that in Germany their model is the exact opposite. They’d rather hire more people, pay everyone just slightly less, and give everyone more leisure time. Then again nowadays salaried positions are used as a way to make people workhorses and pay them less by working them more.

I applied, had a few rounds of interviews and got the job. Though they gave me a start date, I didn’t actually start until almost a month after the initial start date (because of some time constraints on their end).

Before hiring me, they said my day would consist of driving most of the time. I was fine with that because I was under the assumption that I would only have to drive to establishments in nearby areas (and they told me this as well). By nearby areas, I mean in MY city and the town next door (20 mins away). However, for the past two weeks, I’ve been driving to a city that wasn’t listed and is 45 mins away. From there, I drive back to a city that WAS listed (about 25 mins from there), and so on.

In a week and a half, I’ve put over 500 miles on my car (that I purchased last year). I understand a car is meant for driving, but I would not have taken the role if I knew I’d be driving so far away, multiple times a day. I don’t think I’m fit for the job and I’d like to quit.

431,Social debt - an Alternative to universal basic income,"Government is inherently wasteful. But private corporations are inherently greedy and inefficient from the perspective of the customer (they're efficient for the capital owner)

What if everybody had a bank account that started in debt from birth and every government service you use dips into that account. So if you get medical care your debt goes minus. So rather than give everybody money and try to find a way of paying for it, we put you into debt by $20,000 a year and you pay 60%-80% tax on any amount above that to pay back your debt to society.

Rather than paying back banks, you're paying back society and everybody has enough to survive.

Apparently taxes for the wealthiest were huge in the 1960s. Like 90% but I'm sure they worked their way around it. Or as they did in recent times change law to lower the tax rate through lobbying.

Rather than owing private interests like banks we can owe society and that should be more equitable form of debt because other people are helping you survive.

Student loans are the most similar but if everybody received money in the form of debt, then prices will go up like the price of education went up as academic institutions realised the government was a blank check.

If I could get a life funding mortgage of 30 years for £250,000 I could survive for 23 years with my bills. As long as I don't have to pay a bit off every month I could have free time for years at a time.

I could study, research, write, draw, create, innovate at my own pace. And receive a higher salary later in life if people offered me this credit.

Posted by u/ayrtonprostmacher + oh

Round out today that my boss has been
keeping a tall of people who say they
have poor internet.

Since we started working from home there’s been
certain members of staff who have used the “my wife is
really shit” excuse quite a few times now.

Today we had a tears meeting to discuss a gradual
return to the office and of course a lot of people
(including myself and my team) are very happy working
from home and are keep to keep away from the office
as long as possible.

One girl from sales pipe up and said she didn't think it
would be fair on the sales staff if they were judged on
performance as sales had been low because of could
(only for her mind, the other 3 sales people had done
fine). His is when the boss announces that he’s been
keeping a tall of every time someone has used poor
internet as an excuse for poor performance, turning

in projects late, or not being online during work hours.
The was somewhat made an example of and it turned
out she had the second highest tall on the list with a
shopping 32!! 2 of those she missed an entire days
work.

Long and short of it is that me and my team have
proved ourselves to be hard working and responsible,
being more productive than we were during 2019. And
there was actually no specific team or department
that had not embraced WFH and managed to keep
the quality and quantity of work up. BUT, because of
individuals that can't be trusted.....sorry, as my boss put
it “aren't fortunate to be blessed with reliable internet
during work hours” we may have to look at keeping
our main office open and moving back towards the
traditional 5 day 9-5 that we did previously.

Of course, my boss being the legend that he is finished
the meeting along the lines of “however, if the number
of people suffering chronic internet issues reduces
significantly over the summer holidays, our original plan
to only keep our meeting rooms, kitchen, and a number
of hot desk for those who prefer not to work remote
will remain in place. Of we are forced to continue renting
a large sales and operational space on the floor above |
will see to it that the expenditure does not go to waste.

To come on lazy quakers, pull your socks up and don't
ruin it for the rest of us. Of | have to go back to paying
£500 a month in childcare I’m holding Due personally
responsible!

Edit: The responses have demonstrated the exact sort
of people who would do this sort of stuff. It’s not your
god given right to slack off at work, and an employer
isn’t morally obliged to middle people in case they get
their feelings hurt. His isn’t primary school and people
can't be expected to take a salary without being brought
to task if they don’t work hard for it. Of they don’t want
to be called out during a group meeting they should
probably keep their trap shut.

Now what?","Alright so with a wife who's happy with a full time job (she does what she loves), I suddenly only need to work 3 days a week. Two days of work, one day of house keeping. That leaves me with 4 days for myself.

I had always planned to start making my own games, and see how that works out. I've done it in the past, working &gt;50 hours a week on a game project. They never got finished however and while I loved some aspects of it I was miserable regarding others. So that doesn't really feel like a healthy option. 

I do have some hobbies, but none of them I'd be able or willing to do almost 32 hours a week. Same goes for friends. I've got quite a large pool of people I'd be happy to spend time with, but they often aren't available from Monday to Friday.

So, in preparation of next year, I come here asking some advice / stories. How did you cope with so much time without just turning to videogames or something similar (a fate im afraid might befall me)? How did you transition from full time to part time? What tips can you give me?

I was also thinking about maybe working a job 3 days a week instead of 2 and then having some extra money, but that also feels wrong somehow.

444,Vacation days that were already approved REMOVED because of their mistake.,"I just started at this company last September. They gave me a form with benefits etc. Part of it was PTO summary which outlined how much I would get and when. I get 4 batches my first year and then after this year I'll start getting all of it at once in January.

So every 3 months since September I've been getting PTO. I am taking 4 days right after labor day to go on vacation out of state (Which is already all planned and booked). Apparently, according to my boss, they *accidentally* gave me too much pto in my first few batches. So he went in and removed 2 of my 4 days that were ALREADY APPROVED and said not only that but I will not get a final batch in September like I was supposed to. 

I can *only* schedule vacation if the system says I have it. So everything I scheduled was with time it said I had. Not only that but I told him I was pissed because now I have no time for the rest of the year apparently when I was under the impression I would be getting more days in September. 

I spoke with HR and they are auditing my time and discussing what to do about it. Is this my fault? Am I wrong to be absolutely seething with rage that this dude just straight up canceled two of my days that were already approved? Also, I generally use my days simply because I know I'm about to get more, but now I'm not I guess.

449,Ideas for Trolling at Job Interviews,"""nO oNe wAnTs tO WoRk aNyMoRe""


For the first time in my life I have a job that is actually pretty fulfilling (working at a top-notch animal shelter) as opposed to merely just working to help some rich chud get richer. Like many of you, I've had to work a bunch of super crappy jobs in the past, and I think it would be a lot of fun to apply to places, get interviews, and then... idk what exactly, but definitely not *actually* show up and do any work lol. 


I'd like to ask them some questions that would make them sweat. Make them realize that it's the workers, not the business owners, who have the power and who make things truly happen. To troll the exploiters, to drive home the point that what they are offering their laborers is simply not satisfactory, that kind of thing. 


I figured this sub would be a good place to get some potential ideas for how to go about doing this. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)",False,otjynd,JohnGoodmanNSFW,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/otjynd/ideas_for_trolling_at_job_interviews/,10,1

He said, ""Fuck those stupid Jews and their stupid religion and laws!"" ""If they don't want our fucking product, they can fuck off."" So, yeah, that was one instance. If I'm slacking my co-worker, he can see my co-worker typing me or calling me about business, so he slacks me and says, ""Get back to work, talking to Sean won't make you sales."" LOL, what a c-nt. I'm the top sales-person.

He's always sexually inappropriate, but I work from home in another state, so I'd never be able to prove it. Company has about 13 people, so they don't have to follow any laws.

463,I’m finally doing it! My last day is Saturday,"I’ve been working as a waitress for the past 8 years, different restaurants at different levels, corporate and privately owned, you name it. Current work at a higher end sushi joint, where I’ve been pulling about a grand a week. We are still tip pooling and constantly understaffed. We have tons of applications but my boss insists hiring based on personality rather than experience. Recently we hired a 19 year old with no industry experience. It was a breaking point for the staff. We are all over 25 and seeing sales (and our pool payout from that) get dragged down by the lack of knowledge and professionalism of our new teammate has been frustrating. Not to mention, always late, always wants to leave early, has no concept of work ethic or what’s an appropriate uniform (our policy is pretty lax just look professional and wear all black). Last week I had a sit down with my GM and politely asked that our newest server go through some extra training for beverages, since this is the area where she is lacking, I was very professional and even offered to work extra hours and help with the training myself for the benefit of the team. My boss used this sit down as an opportunity to air all of his grievances focused at me. I’ve been with this restaurant for two years, through the pandemic, was the only server to step forward and go back on the floor when we opened for dine in, working those shifts solo. He told me that he holds me to a higher standard than the rest of the staff because of my experience and that my sales should more than make up for the other servers shortcomings. I let him say his bit, went home and immediately started looking for another job. By Sunday afternoon I’d had two phone interviews, and put in my notice on Monday. I’m exiting the industry to pursue a career in agriculture and even though I’m taking a massive pay cut, I feel like a huge weight is being lifted off my shoulders. This sub has really opened my eyes to the exploitation I was experiencing at work and how little respect I was being shown. Shout to you guys!

471,I'm finally out of the rat race!!!,"Hey, everyone. I finally achieved my life long goal of retiring and wanted to share with my fellow anti-workers.

Since I was a kid watching my mom (single mom raising 4 kids) working so hard and making no money, I decided I wanted to try to retire early.

When I started college, I decided to major in Math and study programming. My wife (then gf) studied Aerospace Engineering. Since we graduated about 7 years ago, we have been trying to save as much as we can while taking care of our moms (both single moms who had no money to retire with) which resulted in us having pretty much being in hell for years. 

We bought a house in the suburbs of the city we worked in. We also saved and invested about $40k per year which ended up being a bit over $400k total. Really nice, but not nearly enough for retirement. I thought we'd need to be working for at least another 15 years to retire. However, late last year, the startup I had been working since graduating went public and the equity I had received was worth 7 figures. Since then I have been so ecstatic. I sold my shares near the peak and quit.

Now we're in our late 20s and out of the rat race. I just wanted to say an emphatic, ""Fuck Work.""",False,otjdbh,fuckw0rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/otjdbh/im_finally_out_of_the_rat_race/,34,1

480,*Disclaimer* Teacher Rant:,"I know I’m probably preaching to the choir, but here I go anyway. 

First off, shout-out to all the amazing teachers out there who show up early, stay late, work after hours, work on the weekends, and work during the summer all for the betterment of our students! The reason I went into teaching was for the students and to try to make a meaningful impact on the world.

Nevertheless, we should not have to “volunteer” our time to help administration plan events or attend “voluntary” conferences for school/district wide initiatives without proper compensation. 

Teachers are already under appreciated and underpaid enough as it is. However, districts and administrations are ALWAYS asking teachers to do more and to help them. The biggest issue I have in saying “no” is that they always send the message:

 “WeLl WhAt AbOuT tHe StUdEnTs?”
“ It WiLl HeLp OuR cOmMuNiTy AnD sChOoL cUlTuRe”

(insert other toxic message)

This is TOXIC and it needs to change! It discounts all the hard work and effort when teachers already “volunteer” so much of their time outside of school and our contracted hours.

I shouldn’t feel pressured or guilt bombed to have to “volunteer” 13-16 hours of my summer to attend a conference or planning event without pay (don’t worry they covered the registration cost and lunch for one day 🙄).

We are professionals and deserve to be treated and paid like one if it falls outside of our contracted hours. I’m sick and tired of being taken advantage of!",False,otb3qf,Hazzy12,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/otb3qf/disclaimer_teacher_rant/,10,1

Ya know the ""work-flow"". Sometimes pulling doubles because I like having money to spend. Plus I was naive to think of myself as part of their family and maybe one day I would have part of the buisness. At the time my boss's son who was taking over had just developed testicular cancer and no one thought he would make it. Thankfully he did but my dream obviously won't come true.


Well fast forward I realized I wasted my years at this place. I'm amazingly knowledgeable on literally everything I sell. I have such great customer service and I know the ins and outs of the industry. At some point my boss wanted to open another store with me but I denied it. I don't trust him as far as I can throw him. Anyway I guess I'm getting to is that 2 years ago I put my foot down and told him I'm only working two specific days a week of my choosing. He had no choice but to agree, I'm his longest and best worker. 


Sunday, someone called out fucking me over, it was so crazy busy. My job is %100 customer service. Teaching customers about animals, grabbing fish or answering their questions while also running registers. It's tons of multitasking and helping multiple people at once. Today I walk up to my boss and ask him for a raise. He didn't hesitate, he said absolutely and it will start next check! I'm not putting more hours though, one extra dollar is not worth an extra day or even hour of my time even though it is mostly under the table pay. The work involved isn't worth it.

494,"Clocking in Damages my Empathy, and Sends my Paranoia Through the Roof","I really give a damn about the people around me, when I go out for errands in public I have a rule where I try to compliment at least one stranger, and I am so open to different types of people that the first time I heard the attack helicopter joke I was genuinely curious about pronouns. But at work? 

At work I have a reflexive disdain of the people who walk in through those doors. I have had to re-unlearn some fatphobia because of an ugly instinct that started brewing when a particularly large person went up to order. If somebody wants a special order I am likely to mess up the order on purpose just because of how dare they insist on taking up more of my time than necessary. Everybody I see is the enemy and I hate it. I have struggled for years with Paranoid Schizophrenia, and I've realized my work is triggering shit. I am constantly hearing noises I can't find sources for, seeing people in the building I cannot later relocate, and there was a week I realized I was lashing out because I didn't recognize these people as wanting food, but as WANTING TO COME BOSS SOMEBODY AROUND. 

There are some items that I am not even trained to make and I don't know what the protocol is. My Culinary Arts degree never taught me how to use a fucking industrial microwave to make breakfast sandwiches. And nobody was willing to work a third shift alongside me to train me, because while people will claim it is the easiest shift, I am one of two people who is willing to work it. 

I don't lash out at or fuck with co-workers, even when they deserve it. So my brain has started to view customers, particularly ones with complaints, as attacking me. People notice too. My coworkers talk about how I am good to work with, I get along with everyone, I work well, but I freak people out with how I react to customers, often when I cannot explain why.

500,The Missing Parts of Capitalism,"Here's what I've been thinking right? I'm curious what any of y'all think about this. The 3 major parts of a capitalist economy is land, labor and capital. I believe to have a comfortable economic life, you need to have a balance of all 3. The typical problem is when someone has ONLY labor to offer, but no land or capital. The purpose of capital is for an individual to own assets that make money for the owner while they are not actively working. This is basically passive income. Labor is self explanatory as we all know what that means. Last one is land. Land I think is one of the most important because ""land gives the opportunity to survive without the support of larger society"". Lose your job? That's fine, tend to your land, grow food, maybe have some farm animals. So basically if you lose the ability of labor or capital, you can still support yourself. The reason why for Alot of us nowadays that are struggling financially and hating labor is because it's all we got. The general public does not own land, it's rented or leased, or mortgaged. The general public does not own capital, so we are completely dependant on labor, which is dangerous. Now the issue I feel is for people to gain access to land and capital. I feel like if an individual got access to those missing parts of capitalism, that has the potential to help solve quite Alot of issues.

Im not a transhumanist like most people in this group, im actually quite the opposite, but i have found that we may actually have similar ideals. I want people to reject modernity and go back to the basics. The simple joys of life are rooted in productivity, that is actually productive. Things like building your own stuff, or farming, or self sufficiency. My greatest anger is that i cant actually do this. Even if i outright bought land after working for a while i would still have to pay taxes for the government landlords. Its aggravating. 

Another difference between me and many others on this subreddit is income flow. I understand a lot of people here have been forced to take service industry jobs or retail jobs which are ass. Ive been fortunate enough to go on a different path in life, and used my 10k saved for college during highschool to fund myself through an apprenticeship for electrical work. I make 40 dollars an hour at 20 and have lived as frugally as possible. Still i am tens of thousands of dollars away from property in the woods. I wish i didnt have to do all this just to buy a farm, it seems so unhuman like. I want to know if anyone here has similar feelings towards modern capitalism, and if there is hope or a reason for me to keep fighting to make my dream a possibility.

Worked part time for a year working 16 hours a week. They don't pay by the minute and instead round your hours by 15 minutes, so if you were scheduled 7 am to 3 PM and clocked in at 7 while clocking out at 3:10, you'd only be given 8 hours pay instead of those extra 10 minutes.

With relief usually showing up anywhere from 3 minutes to 10 minutes late that can add up. Fast forward to now, working 32 hours full time, and my relief tends to show up early so I usually work a few minutes less than 8 hours each shift now. You'd think I'd still get paid the full shift right? Apparently not since I worked one less minute than the full 32 hours for the week, I only got paid for 31.5 hours.

Of course it's ok to work several more minutes over your scheduled amount without being compensated for it but if you so dare as work a minute less then we'll make sure you don't get paid for that lost minute!

509,"Living with your parents after 18: Hear me out westerners. I think a multigenerational household structure is what can make long term unemployment a feasible/positive choice for people. Also, the concept of independence is a scam.","Firstly, I know that many people do not have a good relationship with their family and staying at home would be detrimental to their mental health. I'm definitely not looking down on those people, these are just my reflections. Also, my family are definitely not rich.

I am 24 and lived alone for a short time whilst at uni. When I graduated I came back home and I now live with my mum and sister. My internship is coming to an end this week and I'm applying for other jobs but I'm not having a meltdown. And that's simply because I live at home. This benefits my mum in that I contribute to the rent and bills and buy food and stuff for my sister when I can. This benefits me because I don't have to do this stuff if I can't. She actually encourages me to take a break from work, and I know that doing that won't mean I go hungry and end up on the streets.

We're all familiar with the idea that once you're 18 you fuck off out of the house and see your parents once every however. I grew up in the UK where this is the common mindset but I'm a POC and when I explain that I enjoy living at home to my white friends they're like ?????????

And these are people who are happy living with their families, have good homes and everything they could want but still want to move out to a smaller shittier house and shackle themselves to having constant full-time work in order to survive because of 'independence'. I've lived alone, I've lived with strangers and I've lived with casual friends and living with my family by FAR beats any of these other arrangements. I save money, I'm around people that love and support me, live in a relatively big house and have my own space. 

And yet I feel guilty for living at home?

Looking for good solid counterpoints.

  

[**Person**](https://nextdoor.com/profile/7384099/?is=mention) **A:**

If people are NOT taking these above min wage jobs, what good does a National Min Wage do???? “Examples” - Walmart just announced free college - Walmart paying $15 for fulfilling E-commerce orders - McDonalds is raising salaries - Chic Filet has always paid far above minimum wage - Chipotle is raising food prices to accommodate increased salaries - Ice Cream scoopers starting pay is $11 hr - Also happening, National Fast Food chains automating restaurants (less jobs) - Retail has almost completely automated the self checkout (less jobs) - Online ordering is growing for these same retailers BUT do they need the same staff levels to support the predicted ordering volume? (Probably not)

[**Person**](https://nextdoor.com/profile/7384099/?is=mention) **B:**

All evidence to the contrary you want to say there is no shortage? Talk to ANY recruiter or hiring manager. They are dying for qualified candidates to fill positions. Never in my life have I seen restaurants offering a signing bonus to come to work. Looks at the facts. If you realized how many entry-level jobs have been eliminated by artificial minimum wages, you’d have a different opinion on that subject. Simply mandating a higher minimum does not make an employee more valuable to the business, just more costly. If the value isn’t there you cannot expect a business to sustainably pay more. The math is real, not ideological. If raising the minimum wage was a good idea why not make it $50/hour?

I made a decision a few months back to stop working, just to see if anyone noticed.

I come into work, go to my office, and watch youtube videos all day. I attend meetings but I have stopped offing solutions. So far no one seems to care.

I did this because of the way the lower-paid employees are treated. We have people here that are working 7 days a week because the pay we give them is so bad they have to do to get by. It is outrageous. 

The owner of the company has a ""cheap"" Audi he drives to work so people don't see his ""real cars"" that it would take our average working 10 years to afford.   
He is building a new summer house close to the office that has a 4000sq first floor. 

These people that work for him are meaningless and I am thinking about putting my job on the line to let the world know. I doubt it will change anything but I feel like it would make me feel better.

When I am not watching youtube I spend my time talking to our ""working"" class. I ask them what they would do with their time if they had 3 million dollars. One lady said she would garden all day. I asked her why she was working here and not doing season gardening work. She quit a few days ago to learn how to run her own landscaping company. A Win for me. I told her that she should send the owner a sympathy card for his loss of a great employee. I hope she does.

I'm making suggestions to people that when they estimate how long it will take to complete a task they should double that time because the owner doesn't need any more money.

521,"Is antiwork ""anti-work""?","I began work after my divorce willing to take whatever job I could get as a craftsman.  I have experience, and own my own tools, but the average going rate for a new hire bench carpenter is about $16-$19/hr.  So I took what I could get that would at least appear to advance my career on paper.  

Four jobs later, every job in between I found myself on a roof; sometimes 30 feet or more up, thank god for the riser rooms, other times it was a giant extension ladder, working on a swamp cooler because the owner of the company wanted to save a few bucks and I was tired of being hot.

I have a mechanically inclined background so fixing them isn't an issue.  It's the fact that I repeatedly find myself on a roof getting paid trash fixing equipment I didn't sign up to fix, often with my own tools that sets me off.  Also knowing what it costs to hire a proper tech, but using me due to convenience doesn't sit right with how I believe business should be done...  And also knowing the only reason I'm up there is so I can ""get back to work"", have the shop cooled effectively and not accidentally break or lose a finger because its 110°(Arizona) inside the shop and my brain is literally cooking itself.  I've never been afraid of working hard, I've just grown disgusted with the fact that this is repeatedly a ""solution"".  

After the last stretch of employment (stuck around for more than a year to prove to myself I could), I decided to walk out after working around 100+ hours on a pay period, and being constantly bombarded with new jobs that my boss ""knew I could get done"". Only to have a dialog with him, where me attempting to justify to him that fatigue is a safety hazard while running a table saw (and other equipment) seemed impossible.  After a heated exchange I packed up my shit and went home to be with my dog.

Since then (almost seven months now) I've reflected a lot on the meaning of my work and why I was ever willing to run hazardous equipment to begin with. Skilled craftsmen are in such a high demand anymore that most of them already have a good position filled, or they work on their own terms...after leaving the last job, I've  committed to being 100% self employed.  

I am very passionate about the work I do (mostly cabinetry and fine wood work) and I now make between $40-$70/hr doing something I love for myself and the appreciation of the craft.  It took a lot of effort to save and buy all of the tools I needed, (also fortunate to have a large garage in a house I own) but the freedom I've had to pursue my passion and things I actually love doing has been invaluable to my mental health and desire to exist as a human being in this world gone mad. 

The day I quit my last job I asked my boss, during a very stressful period in my life (too many people I know died in 2020, this was in december), why should I kill myself over your deadlines when I could do it for myself, on my own terms, with the tools I'm already using, and keep not what you pay me, but all of the money?  He looked as if he was about to cry in front of his fancy RV that was often stored in the back the shop.

Long story short(er) I left and I continue to work every damn day, only difference is now I keep all of it... minus the IRS... that may be a different post come Jan 2022 😣

I have some practical experience here to share. I have been homeless twice in my life, once as a teen 17 under duress in a rural area, and once in my mid 20s as more of a choice when I dropped out of my career working in the city at a college in their marketing department. 

I have spent a lot of time with homeless people as well, throughout my life because I relate strongly to North American homeless culture as a whole and I traveled across Canada and the USA essentially as a vagrant.

For some people being homeless is a very bad idea that will only make current problems worse. For others, there are options that may actually expand their life experience especially if you are combining homelessness with travel.

540,Rejected the best offer I’ve ever gotten because the manager is a massive bigot who hates his employees,"Posting this here cause it’s my only social media not linked to my name. 

I was recently contacted unprompted by a recruiter on LinkedIn regarding an assistant site manager position at a rental car company at my nearby airport. She interviewed me over the phone the next day and things seemed okay, so I agreed to interview with the site manager under whom I’d be working. He called me the next day. We spoke for about half an hour, mostly chatting to see if we could get along. Seemed like a cool enough guy. Agreed to an interview the next day, knowing I was under-qualified but still eager to practice. I thought nothing at the time about that quick interview turnover. 

The in person interview the next day was where things took a turn. I showed up for the interview and the first thing I noticed was the striking difference in demographics between the employees and the managers. An entirely white management team presiding over a nearly entirely nonwhite staff isn’t the end of the world, but it was the first red flag of *many.* During the interview, the manager spent little time asking me questions, or even letting me talk. Instead he complained throughout the interview about: 
- His Muslim employees
- His Latino employees
- Democrats, and particularly the President
- Unemployment benefits
Rather than assessing my qualifications, he seemed to want to ensure that I could jive with his hostile attitude towards his employees. To remain civil, I pretended. He spent about thirty minutes complaining about his Muslim employees’ prayer needs, saying he refuses to let them pray at work unless it’s during a standard lunch or 15-minute break. Multiple times he insinuated that they were lying about even needing to pray, and insisted they were instead “lazing around in the meditation room when they should be working.” He also mentioned that most of the team is Latino, following that immediately with “I understand cultural differences can be a real thing, but we have a serious laziness problem here. Nobody wants to do anything.” He unsurprisingly had an employee barge into his office and quit *during the interview* because he had shouted at said employee right in front of me for a minor mistake when I first arrived. 

Later on in the interview, he asked me about my political affiliation and religious beliefs. I know that is unacceptable, but my brain shut down and I engaged semi-honestly with his questions. Evidently I gave the right answers because he offered me a job that night, despite having said he had more interviews scheduled for the next day, at a salary higher than I’ve ever been paid. At first I was over the moon, but then I dwelt on it for a few days. As I initially saw it, my choices were to either accept the job and try to make working conditions better for the people under him or reject it and let them continue to be abused. I was super torn, but eventually decided I couldn’t stomach working under someone so hateful. I replied all to the group email I’d received with the offer letter; this included his manager, the HR director for the state, and the corporate recruiter who’d first contacted me. Here is what I said (names redacted for obvious reasons):

Hey [everyone], 
I’m sorry to do this, but it seems I’m going to have to respectfully decline the offer. Thank you for choosing me for the role. I believe I would have done an excellent job, but for a number of reasons it feels like a less-than-perfect fit. [Asshole], it struck me as unprofessional that you spent such a chunk of our interview complaining about the prayer needs of your Muslim employees. Everything you had to say about your team told me you see yourself as a boss of inferiors rather than as a leader of a team, which is a management style I can neither emulate nor work under. I sincerely wish you luck in finding the right candidate. 

Best wishes,
[5th_Times_The_Charm]”

About five minutes later, I received a reply from the recruiter who’d first contacted me. She asked if I had a few minutes that afternoon to speak with her. I said yes, she called shortly thereafter. On the phone, she pressed for as much information as I could give her about what the manager had said during the interview. She wanted to know every word to the best of my recollection. When we’d finished speaking, she asked if I’d be willing to consider working for the company under another manager, or if I could relocate to one of their other sites. I said yes, and now I’m waiting on a response. I don’t know if he will be fired, or even disciplined. I suppose only time will tell. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting this. I don’t want a pat on the back, I’m not even sure if I did the right thing. Part of me feels like I’d have done better by accepting the job, documenting his behavior, and *then* reporting him to HR. Nonetheless, I am where I am with it now. There’s no changing the past. I’ll keep this post updated. Please let me know if you think there’s something else I should have done, or could still do. I’ve been wrestling with this all week and see no end in sight.",False,otkx7u,5th_Times_The_Charm,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/otkx7u/rejected_the_best_offer_ive_ever_gotten_because/,11,1

That said I don’t want to live in a world like this and don’t think anyone else should have to either. The world is one big fugazi and there is unimaginable suffering on a global scale for the 99%. People are more separated than ever and that will only continue to get worse (status, religion, instilled beliefs etc.). It’s undeniable that all of us has felt like meaningless cogs in the machine given we are here. The 1% have had their time will watch the world burn, we need to take control of our lives. Stop dedicating them to others goals and ambitions for the sake of profit and at the cost of your happiness, otherwise what’s the point. I’m not advocating for any system here as they all have someone on the top with progress to be made.

So long as we live in profit/progress driven world there will always be unhappiness, oppression of everyone out of the norm, homelessness, insufferable stress. Only those who seek power and wealth above all else will always be at the top. 

The fact that the only option we’ve been given to survive is to work with no escape option other than death or retirement strikes unimaginable fear and anger in me. We also have no option on changing the system in any meaningful way like we are hoping for. This should make your blood boil.

So what do we do? Stop consuming? Stop giving the banks money? A mass exodus? 
Given that conglomerates are above the government I don’t see them doing anything in our favour ever. There has to be something WE can do. Something more than fucking memes and rants about our shitty jobs and capitalism or telling each other to find different prospects. This sub was entrancing at first, I was subconsciously putting off the idea the my misery was because I would spend most of my time at a meaningless job and most of my free time studying to better myself at work believing I was finally doing something with my life. This sub made me realize that and that there is more to life out there. Yet many here are adamant on defending a 40 hour work week or advocating a shorter work week and not the abolishment of meaningless and exploitative work. Why? Work is not necessary for survival and I don’t care how hard you’ve worked to get where you are, this idea of fuck you, I got mine is disgusting. Our lives have been stolen and we have/continue to be fed the big lie with no control over our lives and seem to be fine with it. We are disposable and work has divided us.

556,Need advice. An old boss keeps texting me.,"So I worked for a startup for a few years in college. I will not name him or the company obviously. 

I thought he was a cool guy at first but then I realized he was a dick. He treats his employees like trash too. The day I quit, he immediately offered 1,000 a month for my successor on social media. During COVID, he would kinda pressure me into working long after till 11 at night with no pay. I only did it because I still believed in the company. Looking back, this was stupid. I sacrificed weekends to be on Zoom with him. It's stupid, but this was the first time I worked for a startup and in my hearts, I hope I was jumping on the next Facebook. 

He puts his workers through incredibly unrealistic expectations and unfortunately, I have been the receiving end of being scolded and it happened a few times. I am admittedly sensitive to being yelled at, and I almost cried. He was the type that I felt scared to be around. 

I quit on a whim with a one-day notice in October last year. I couldn't take it anymore. I was really depressed and attempted suicide in August. My family still doesn't know that happened. He threatened to come to my house that morning and I thought about calling the cops. He, unfortunately, knows where I live. 

So. He has texted sporadically over the last year. I will not lie. Every time I see a text from him, I kinda freak out. He has texted twice the past week or two and it makes me so uncomfortable knowing that his business has probably been struggling. I and another friend (who owns a startup himself) that worked with him have speculated this. I can feel the hidden agenda. 

I have been nice to him every time he has texted me. When he texts it often feels out of the blue. I have decided to stop engaging with him from now on but my worst fear is that he comes to my house and has been known to make surprise appearances. I could be making a deal out of nothing but I don't want to be harassed. Do you think I'm making the right move by not engaging him?

I applied as a cashier in June of 2019. Got brought in for an interview, got hired as a janitor. Not what I wanted but I got to push carts outside, so I went along with it. 
In training, we were told to notify a “certified professional” to clean up any messes of unknown origin, or messes that come from the body of any kind. So I ask management who the experts are. My boss just smiles and says “well, yoy are!”
A 17 year old kid with asthma, an untrained “certified professional” is authorized to clean glass, blood, and chemicals. Sure, why not. 
So I do my job because this is my first job, so I figured why not just go along. Get paid because I don’t know any better. 
Fast forward to November that same year. I’m having fun, training a new guy, and making tons of friends. I didn’t have my drivers license at the time, and my family was going out of town for thanksgiving. I requested the wrong week off because I’m dumb. So I asked to get the right week off, was denied. Here I am with no way to get to work, working thanksgiving and Black Friday, at home alone. I tell my boss “hey can you help me out here? I goofed up my schedule and can’t get to work.” I was told to turn in my two weeks.

### 1914 translation by H. Rackham

""But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete  account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great  explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one  rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,  but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally  encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there  anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because  it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil  and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,  which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to  obtain some advantage from it?

572,How to get a Medical Exemption with no previous medical records to back up the claim?,"So I want to get a medical exemption certificate which could get me 12 weeks exemption from my unemployment obligations (have to 'volunteer' 25 h/w to get unemployment benefits). Plus it will lay the foundation for me eventually getting reduced obligations in the future like only having to do 10-15 h/w which is way more manageable for me.

Our family doctor is cool and will def write anything I want him to. But the problem is I basically have no real medical records to support anything. Like, I have depression, anxiety, and almost certainly bipolar but never went to the doctor about it so its not like I have years of medical reports to back up my claims. 

My mother has literally 30lbs of medical records over the decades for her bipolar, but because I basically avoid going to the doctor, I have none of that stuff to back me up on my sudden ""he's mentally ill, and unfit for work"" claim.

The only thing I can currently think of is if he mentions about my moms extensive mental health issues and how that stuff obviously runs in families etc so its no surprise that I am now having it (?). Another long shot I have is a hospital discharge I have from when I almost died from a binge eating episode (since eating disorders can tie into mental illness stuff)

Basically, what sort of things can I tell me doctor to write on the form that will give the best chance of it being accepted? (whether its related to mental or physical issues, or both). I've just got a brain lock right now and need any ideas that I can then think about that can jog further ideas etc...

574,You could give me $10million today and I'd still be miserable.,"There comes a point when your situational depression turns into ""just"" depression. There comes a point when workplace anxiety becomes ""just"" anxiety. Whenever you become saturated in negative emotions the cause of those emotions doesn't even need to be present anymore; your mind becomes so molded by a sour disposition that it just stays there no matter what good things may come your way.

Here I find myself making a very decent middle class living at a mid-level job working as an electrical designer after years of shit work and shit pay. I thought I made it, I thought my hard work paid off. But I think back to my happiest times in my life a few years ago and I was making half the salary I make now. But back then I had time to explore my interests. Once 5:00pm hit and I left my office it felt like my day was really just starting.

Now I get paid more, but my responsibilities have gone far past what I believe any healthy human being could handle. If it weren't for a steady supply of alcohol and cannabis I don't know how I'd get through each day.

I understand that only I am responsible for my well-being, but the older and more experienced I get I start to realize that the problems wrecking society aren't based in politics or a system of economics..... they're based on a toxic culture of people who think a subservient attitude will somehow pay off. I see this in the poor and the rich, young and old, educated and non-educated. And until something fundamentally changes in the way we think, it doesn't matter how big the wealth divide is, or who you vote for, or how much money you make... you will NEVER accomplish enough.

576,Decided to quit my job after only a week of working there,"This is a lot but here me out. I recently graduated college and I got a job working at a movie theater (Regal Cinemas). The commute is about 45 minutes to an hour on public transportation and I get paid minimum wage. Most of what I'm doing is Usher work which involves cleaning the theaters, taking out the trash, and cleaning the bathrooms. 

The first day on the job the manager who hired me told us he's switching to another theater. Why? Didn't say. But that raised a huge red flag for me. What kind of manager just up and leaves the theater after hiring seven new employees? The other people said that ""he was always planning on leaving before you got hired"" but I don't believe that shit. 

My coworkers were pretty chill for the most part. However, we would often get into contests of ""who has it worse"" whenever we mention how unhappy we were at the job. It stunned me how it's apparently cool to brag about working two jobs the exhaustion because one job isn't enough to sustain you. What kind of world is it the norm to brag about working excessive hours for minimum pay? Apparently this one. One of my coworkers chastised me for accepting to go home early when they over-scheduled me.

The managers and supervisors were either unremarkable or downright scummy. My shift leader tried to make me take my meal break **an hour into my shift.** When I told him that it was too early, he gives me an attitude and makes me stand at the ticket booth (and I mean stand) for the rest of my shift before sending me home early. If he doesn't do that, he constantly follows me around and waits until I don't look busy to send me off on some stupid busywork errand like sweeping the leaves outside the theater...in the middle of summer.

My real passion has always been writing. It's stupid, and you can all laugh at me, but I thought I could at least write after work. **Nope!** The job made me super exhausted due to the irregular hours and schedule. I never had consistent days off and my weekends were constantly booked. Needless to say, I became super depressed almost immediately. 

I began to resent almost everyone there. My managers, my supervisors, even some of my coworkers for defending the management for giving us pointless and stupid busywork. I contemplated hurting myself because I felt so out of control with my life. I couldn't write because I was too drained. I started looking at this sub because I couldn't stand everyone's complacent attitudes. 

On Wednesday I'm going in with my letter of resignation, my job clothes, and my name tag and telling them I quit. I only worked here a week and I never plan to work in a soul-sucking hellhole like this again. People told me to find another job before I quit but I can't stand another day. I fucking hate Regal and I hope they go out of business. If that means I'll be unemployed for another month or two I don't care. Maybe my mental health will recover after being treated like a disposable dishrag. If I'm disposable, I guess they don't need me anymore.  


TL;DR: My movie theater job sucked the soul out of me and I'm quitting. I hate the commute, the pay, and the schedule. I hope that company goes out of business along with AMC.",False,ot2hsl,Ethereal231,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ot2hsl/decided_to_quit_my_job_after_only_a_week_of/,5,1

580,Tale of the four eternal brothers and the creation of money,"In a time before time there existed four brothers who later became all the humans though not in equal proportion.

The first brother said, What we all must do is relax and have an easy time.

The second brother said, No, we all should make good things for our use.

The third brother said, No, we all should rule and subdue all whom we can.

The fourth brother said, No, we should all study and learn how things really are.

They kept fighting about whose plan was superior and they all had good arguments.

When their father came to know about their quarrel, he called the brother to him who liked to study.

The father said, ""I've called you because your mind is set to learning, so you will listen to me without interrupting.""

The fourth brother, whose name was Scholar, replied, ""I knew that I was the best.""

The father said, ""I repent already. Look you're not the best, but you are the best one for me to talk with, so keep quiet and listen.""

Scholar said, ""Okay.""

""Here's what you will do,"" the father said, ""You will tell your brothers about my will,

""The third brother who wants to rule, tell him that his name is Courageous King, his duty will be to subdue and rule over his two younger brothers and give them protection from wild beasts and each other in return.""

""And the second brother who wants to create, tell him that his name is Inspired Entrepreneur, his duty will be to give work to his younger brother and give his choicest inventions to King, who will share them with you.""

""And the youngest brother who wants to rest, tell him his name is Faithful Servant, his duty will be to do all the work his elder brothers give him without questioning or complaining.""

Scholar said, ""But they won't listen to me!""

Father said, ""They will, I'm with you.""

Scholar said, ""What's my full name?""

Father said, ""I'll tell you later.""

So Scholar went and told the plan to his brothers, they all refused him outright. But with cunning language he told them how this plan will work in their favor, Servant fell asleep during this explanation, so Scholar managed to convince only Entrepreneur and King.

Then Entrepreneur said to King, ""Our youngest brother is too lazy I don't know how we could ever convince him.""

King said, ""Should I scare him into submission?""

Scholar said, ""No need for that. You just give the power to Entrepreneur to create money out of nothing.""

King and Entrepreneur both asked together, ""What's money?""

Scholar said, ""You just write on paper a numeric value and with my magic I will make the Servant slave to it.""

They were shocked, ""You can do that? With just a piece of paper?""

So the Scholar gave them a brief lecture on the economy, ""You will both have to keep pretending that money has value and Servant will fall for it, he's delusional anyway. But the real value will be in all the things that the Servant will produce under the guidance of Entrepreneur and under the protection of King. If Servant gets as much numeric value as there are commodities then there will be a shortage of commodities for the three of us so just make sure to keep Servant always longing for more money using it as a perpetual carrot on a stick, but never fall for the delusion yourself or you'll both become like him.""

Then they woke up the youngest brother and told him, ""Look our Father has given us a magical thing called money which contains all the good that we were all looking for, but we all need to work for it as it is very rare.""",False,osjqar,ukjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/osjqar/tale_of_the_four_eternal_brothers_and_the/,2,1

597,"Manager keeps being unprofessional in communicating with me, we took it to HR","I work part-time and my daily schedule is from 9am to 1pm every day. I had my vaccine on Monday and until the end of that week I was still suffering the side effects. My boss and boss's boss know about this. I agreed I skip Tuesday and Wednesday and compensate for them on Thursday and Friday.

The days I work 8 hours, I need me to come to the office, but the days I work for 4 hours,  I work from home. 

So on Thursday, I woke up and I couldn't make it because of the side effects. I genuinely could not move. So I texted him half an hour before my shift starts that I can't make it and I will work from home today. Monday I will compensate these hours.

He replied with a long ass message saying that this is a business and we need to respect our duties and know our rights...etc. He said that it was against the policy and the policy says at least 1 hours before the shift starts. He then followed it by saying that I am being irresponsible for telling him I won't make it half an hour before the shift starts, and he said to show more responsibility next time.

Had he stopped at telling me that it's against the company's policy to report not being able to make it 30 minutes before the shift starts, and politely asked me to pay attention next time or be more careful with this, I could've nodded in confirmation and moved on.

But this guy gave me a speech on how great the company is, and how I am an irresponsible person, and honestly, that was (at least for me) unnecessary.

So, we talked about this for the next few hours, and decided to take it to HR. It turned out into a heating argument on him being careless with what he says and me having standards on how business communication should take place. On the next Monday, we had the meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

They said that it was my fault for sending a late notice, and I need to pay more attention in the future. But I'm excused because I had the vaccine and things happen unexpectedly so they gave a pass.

As for him, he shouldn't have used the words that he used while issuing a warning/feedback. They understand he has a lot of work to do and responsibility and that can weigh down on the person and make them say things they're not supposed to, so he's also excused.

Moving forward, they asked me to put everything to writing and plan accordingly, and for him:

They agreed with me that saying ""you're irresponsible, be more responsible next time"" whether literally or implicitly, is uncalled for.

They asked him TO BE CONCISE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN TALKING TO ME, to not use adjectives or put qualifications whatsoever on anything that I do. There was no need to put an adjective on the act, whether irresponsible, childish, disappointing...whatever. No need to describe it. You mention it to illustrate then you talk on what to do next (which we absolutely did).

They said TO BE MORE PROFESSIONAL AND NEUTRAL WHILE TALKING WITH ME.

They said that other employees it might be okay to take such words and people are different and have different thresholds. In this case, it was offensive to me and that's enough.

It's just ridiculous how this guy talks to me and the rest of the team. 

In my short 4 years office experience NO ONE HAS EVER SPOKEN TO ME LIKE THAT and I don't and I won't TOLERATE ANYONE SPEAKING TO ME LIKE THAT. I'm here to work, NOT TO HOLLER NAMES AND ADJECTIVES AT PEOPLE LIKE IT'S HIGH SCHOOL.

A job is a place to conduct professional work, therefore communication MUST be straightforward, honest and short to save everyone's time and energy. You talk about the job and the job only, no need to make anything you do (good or bad) personal like in the above case. You're not here to feel better about yourself or feel bad neither, you're not here to judge people on what they do or ""to state facts"", you're not here to put other people in place or whatever. You're here to work. Any stress event must be eradicated.

Whether the employee is doing a shitty or a good job, there are official protocols to follow on how to deal with them, and calling them irresponsible is not one of them.

Fun fact: A colleague described him as a dog who barks and never bites because of how ""emotional"" he gets and how offensive his speech is. I saw him in the office the other day. He asked a colleague to send a request to someone else, so the colleague pulled up Teams and started typing the request, rookie mistake. The manager was like, ""You need to do it through email. EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE THROUGH EMAILS..."" and he went on for at least a freaking minute. That'd have honestly made me mad.

I had been introduced to a gentleman ""C"" by my cousin ""E"". ""C"" told me this story about how he was able to leave work for a few hours with no consequences. 

Fast forward a week. One of the busiest nights of the year. They absolutely needed me. And I was absolutely about to go home... Because I remembered ""C's"" excuse. He had to get underwear and it was an emergency.... So, I walked around into one of the restaurants... Paced a bit. Then headed over to my boss. ""Y"".. The one guy you really didn't want to make upset. I explained to him my ""situation""... ""Y, I need to talk to you."" I said to him. He was very busy. He was already angry. He glared at me.. I said ""I walked over to""N"" by table 24. I thought I was going to fart so I walked away from the table quickly enough to get away. But when I farted, I shit my pants. ""Y"" I need to fucking leave right now to go buy some damn boxers. I smell like shit. I need to go now!""...

601,So... 100% of my bosses have COVID.,"This news comes a couple of weeks after receiving an interdepartmental email explaining that, because the vaccine exists now, the company won't be shutting down areas to clean/quarantine them if someone tests positive.

Welp... someone *did* test positive.

And then everyone who went to lunch with that person tested positive, along with everyone who was in a conference room with them except for one dude who was wearing a mask.

Both of my bosses are among the positives, and they are both ill enough to have to stop working.

Several other department heads are also sick, including the guy who advocated against remote work policies because he believed somewhere in his tummy that people can't be productive from home.

I like both of my bosses well enough as people, so I'm not gloating about them being sick here. I'm just pointing out that everyone needs to still be careful at work, because the only reason I know about this is because I am friendly with one of the executives.

They aren't making this known generally around the company, and there are a lot of workers who share open office space.

I'm currently on welfare and don't have to work, It's not that I'm lazy, actually quite the opposite, I just cannot do a job when my heart is not 100% in it, I get terribly depressed.

So I've been thinking there might be something that I would really enjoy doing with all my heart, but it seems hard to find something.

Things I like: 

Fitness/sports (have ""bruce lee"" physique and am decent at calisthenics and very good at fencing, also amateur boxer and runner). 

I used to be a musician but got burnout from going to music college so I quit playing completely as it just caused me constant stress but I still love listening to music. 

I like being in nature.

I also like inspiring and teaching people about things that interest I'm good at.

Some things I have considered but ultimately too many negatives: 

Gardener: having to work with toxic pesticides for ""diseased"" shrubs and pests etc rules this out

Fireman: sounds great until I consider the health complications from breathing in smoke, burns, overheating etc

Fitness instructor: seems like it would be hard to find a steady job and most likely would have to spend all day indoors in a sweaty gym, just doesn't sound appealing

construction work: sounds terrible for long term health in general, inhaling dust, working heights, falling debris etc

Sport teacher at secondary schools: actually sounds like the most rewarding and enjoyable out of all these jobs, but it requires a 3 year degree and there will be a lot of swimming in chlorinated pools which are terrible for our health.

So basically I'm asking for suggestions, it's not that I really want to work, but I wouldn't be against doing something for society, if it is something that I really enjoy and helps other people.",False,ospk5r,thonking479,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ospk5r/currently_on_welfare_but_would_consider_a_job_if/,3,1

612,I don’t feel bad about not furthering my career,"I applied for a higher-paying job with shorter work weeks at my current job, with the main focus being I’d be home with my family more and make slightly more than what I’m making right now. 

But I didn’t have high expectations. Someone who is already in a similar leadership role applied and while people don’t hate me, I’m not the most personable person.  So I wasn’t surprised or upset when I heard the other person got the job.

So my managers call me into their office to talk about their decision. One of the factors  that affected their decisions was because I made it known that this job would get me more time at home and they were looking for someone who’d be more available to be in a leadership/educational role (I tuned out when I walked in the room because I already knew I didn’t get the job). 

Then they asked me if I wanted to train for the regular shift leadership position. And I thought about it. I still intend to apply for any similar opening in the future and can actually change my answers based on this interview. But to add more responsibilities onto my person, attend classes, and have to deal with the shit this role would put me into on a regular schedule for what amounts to $1 extra an hour? A’int worth it.

As a woman, no matter how good of a bug finding journey u have provided, more emphasis will be on good that we catch the bug, but for men, it will be GOOD JOB!! MY MAN!!
As a woman, no matter how good ur previous coding could be, u will be the first suspect for a misjudged package misplacement, “I’m surprised at how this code could be written in that way” is what u will get
As a woman , u will be giving the advice and then coding u will not be needed, and men can take the credit and boss will be “my man finds a lot of things” and ur fellow man colleague, will take it all credits with him without a word .

They basically told me that my “pace” and “presence” aren’t enough?? I’ll admit that when I first started I was a bit slow and sometimes didn’t do much but I’ve been trying my best these past few weeks and there are several things that wouldn’t get done if I wasn’t there. Plus my managers have been on holiday for a few weeks and haven’t seen anything I’ve been doing!! I now do at least 10k steps there and I’ll volunteer to do certain tasks and help my co-workers out. Keep in mind this is a minimum wage retail job, wtf do they expect of me? I was also told my “attitude” contributed to their decision.. they referenced a time where I was asked to work on a different department and all I asked was what I would be doing in the different department - apparently this has been interpreted as an “attitude” problem??? I have never outright refused to do anything and I always try to be polite. I’ve never took a holiday and I’ve been available anytime they needed me, working 35 hours a week. Also keep in mind that I suspect I’m on the autistic spectrum so I’ve probably unintentionally come off as rude or blunt but I feel frustrated as this is something I don't even realise I’m doing. I have never been officially diagnosed however so not like I can rely on that as a defense... 

I’m only 18 and already feeling disenfranchised with the entire capitalist system. I hate that even though I'm completely anti-capitalist, there is still some part of me that feels like I was somehow in the wrong. And also that this is making me anxious about my own future and how I'll get another job even though I'm only 18... capitalism is a hellscape. I'm thinking that if they show me this little respect, even after I've done 35 hours a week and had no holiday time then I don't even really want this job.  Just because I don’t completely conform to their corporate bullshit, they decide they don't want me. But it's their loss because I know for a fact certain things won't get done if I'm not there, and I hope they realise this. I have a month to go before I start university... not sure how I'll get another job when I'm there but maybe I'll find something.

658,Retail perspective," First time poster here. I'm a 27 year old manager. (I know im scum, but im just tryna survive) I've worked retail all my life. 
For the most part I like my job but man do I agree with everything this sub speaks too. No one should have to sell their soul to survive. 

Things have changed so much in the last year. And I finnaly feel like the workforce is in a position to start making demands. I work for one of the better retailers in my area. We pay way better for entrylevel positions than Walmart,Kroger, and various other retailers in the area. I like my company. 
These past few months have been the worst I've ever seen in my near decade of retail work. We can't hire anyone right now because no one is applying to work. And those we do hire walk out in days. I dont blame anyone but the corporations for this. Rediculouse hours, shitty pay, and overall increasing workloads without compensation is just not right. For years all of the retail industry has had a ""quit I dare you"" and a "" well just replace you"" mentality and now it's finnaly biting them in the ass because people are calling their bluff. It's forced my company to raise pay for specific positions but the change isn't happening fast enough in my opinion. 
This go round for Performance reviews I straight up gave everyone on my team an outstanding review and the max payincrease I could. But even then it felt like no one got more than 80cents man. And that's the limit of my authority on pay increases. Any more would require top leader intervention with hr approval which will never happen. 
Iv been working 60 hours a week just to help my team get the job doneso they don't have to work more than their 40 and trying and keep my department afloat. I dont get paid much more than my other employees and it kills me that we are all stuck like this. 
For those of you who are fighting this cause I commend you. Your creating a better world for those after. Change always sucks in the beginning but im rooting for the change to happen because I hate to see some of my team in the position they are in. No one should have to work like this just to make ends meet. I'm exhasted, and burnt out. And if im tired then I know my guys are. 
Iv always tried to be the change I want to see and make the lives of my team easier by changing the culture from within but the system is just broken man. 

For anyone curious starting pay for my departments are as follows
$14.50 daytime
$16 overnight
$17 for a lead

664,"Anti-climatic but long update to ""My HR manager posted a meme about Bezos not paying his employees while going to space in a Slack channel. I posted this right after. I have a meeting with her, my direct manager, and the owner of the company on Monday.""","I didn't get fired. Got a warning. Also got to be in dgaf mode for once ever and let some things off my chest...some legit some just honestly kind of petty. 

This may not be word for word but it's something I've thought about a lot so it's close: I asked him if as a business owner who employs people who want to work to support themselves does he take the cost of living into consideration in relation to what he chooses to pay his employees.

He said ""I don't know why that matters.""

It's honest I guess. I could be an idealistic hippy here and say if I owned a business it would be extremely important to me for my full time employees to be able to afford to live where they work. Maybe if I was in his spot I'd change my mind. Super easy to type that shit.

Told them it's soul crushing humiliating to have to be told by your manager you're getting a $1 raise a year from now. And have to find the right level of fake enthusiasm to make them move onto the next subject. 
Which also meant on my work anniversary if my parents decide to leave the state and I want to stay I'll be living on a friends couch absolute best case scenario...but more likely out of my car...then I'll have to walk in that day and get handed a balloon and told how much I'm valued and respected. That the week before I had $30 in my bank account and decided on gas to get to work over food and was still made to feel like I'm not dedicated enough...he offered to help manage my budget. 

A few of us in the office have felt like they've been talked down to by the HR manager...unfortunately none of them decided to ever say a word or even rate her low on an ""anonmyous"" poll so boy did I look like a god damn asshole when I told her how we sometimes perceive her. They also really didn't buy that in a small office there's no real anonymous poll. 

I was told that my goal here was to become a manger. I brought it back to the cost of living and told him one of the risks we take when we accept a low or any starting pay is what the future pay will look like. Companies don't want to tell you the current pay getting a future pay schedule is impossible. So we roll the dice and hope it's one that offers a path to a living wage. If he thought I was manager material could he tell me what the salary is for one. If I think it's a fair wage I'd work my ass off to get promoted to one. Shockingly he did not think this was a good idea. Then told me no one wants to ""pay their dues"" and just wants money now. 

So...it's cool I didn't get fired after saying all that. Probably be awkward in there. There's a few coworkers who are good people, been giving each other resume tips and references. 

And could you fight the power in at least ONE anonymous poll. Fuck.",False,ot35cc,133A,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ot35cc/anticlimatic_but_long_update_to_my_hr_manager/,8,1

The owner is one of the biggest assholes I’ve ever met in all my time as a server. But don’t think that means others haven’t come close... However, this rich asshole knows he’s got power and thinks he can do whatever he wants and talk to others as if they aren’t human. He was in the restaurant yesterday making his rounds and I was about to carry a beer over to a table but it needed topped off. SECONDS before I was about to turn around and ask the bartender to do so, he yells “GET OVER HERE NOW.” He’s not even making direct eye contact with me, he’s literally spitting at the mouth from anger and yelling at the floor saying “DID ANYONE TASTE THAT BEER? IT NEEDS TO BE IN AN ICED GLASS WITH A GOD DAMN FUCKING FOAM HEAD.” Making a scene for literally no reason. First of all it was a coors lite and I wanted to ask him what the hell he expected lol. I was so fucking filled with rage, I had to contain myself and just bite my tongue (for now) but the second I’m able to jump ship I’m giving that prick a rude awakening. 

One of my best friends from high school has been the General Manager there for over a year before Covid, and he just left recently for another General Manager position at a gym. Before he was the GM, he served there and his mom would come in and help host from time to time. We aren’t allowed to wear colognes, perfume, etc. because it’s a high end place and certain food smells don’t mix well with the scents, which I get. However, this man had the god damn nerve to put his hands on my friends mother when he thought she was wearing perfume but it was coming from her coat. He gripped her hair up and sniffed it after yelling at her about the whole thing. There are countless other things this guy does and he’s just a horrible, miserable asshole with a fuck ton of money.

668,A question on legality (and kind of a rant),"I’ll start by saying I live in a right-to-work state. So I used to work for a very successful, large, and high volume veterinary clinic that was owned by a family. I started in the kennel at a generous $11/hr (pretty high starting pay for the job in my area) and after about 7 months I was offered to train as a veterinary technician. So going from walking dogs and scooping poop to assisting in surgery, managing hospital cases, handling controlled drugs etc. I was not offered a raise when I completed the training time, but since I had only been there less than a year I didn’t think too much about it.  Years go by and I excelled at the job by quite a bit (to toot my own horn a tad).  Most of the doctors by this point came to rely on me heavily every shift. I became slightly irked at my lack of a raise through the entire time. One day I decided I was going to reach out to the owner and ask for a raise. I was told I needed to wait for our next reviews. I was fairly irritated at this point as I had 5 years of fantastic reviews, but didn’t push it too hard. After a series of events that had me working 16+ hours a day for 9 days in a row for a few weeks I decided to push the subject again. It was obvious the owner was irritated at this, but given the circumstances (we had become severely understaffed suddenly) and the fact my technician manager and every other doctor (including the owners son and daughter) backed me up he yielded and I was bumped up to $15/hr. Roughly 2 months later I was 4 hours late to a shift due to driving my wife, at the time, to a psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt. Everyone was super understanding and nice. 2 weeks later I get my paycheck and it’s substantially lower than expected and I realized I was paid minimum wage with no warning or anything. I emailed the owner after days of failing to get him on the phone asking why and he responded, while cc’ing every doctor and manager at the practice, that my tardiness and “lack of focus” was the reason for my pay cut for that pay period. Every single person included in that email disagreed with him. After a few conversations with him I told him I would not be continuing my employment there after my already established schedule, to which he responded “tOo lAtE ur aLreaDy fIRed”. I was pissed at his lack of appreciation for me busting my ass for 5 years for him at the time, but as time has gone by I find myself more and more pissed at the sudden, no warning pay cut as a punishment and that I was conditioned so well to not even question the legality of the move.  Was that even legal? 

I now work remotely in a job I barely ever even talk to my manager and thinking back on what all happened at the clinic just puts a sour taste in my mouth for most employment options where I have to deal with power horny owners who get a kick out of flexing their superiority against the hired peons.

686,I think working in customer service has profoundly affected my mental health and self-worth for the worst.,"Hi all,

I don't know if this is just me. Maybe I wasn't meant to work in customer service. As a student, I worked in customer service for a few years. The job was very demanding, in a fast-paced environment (in hindsight, that's because I did the job of 3 people). But it was good for students as far as schedule went and it was above minimum wage.

My first year, I broke down crying after about two dozen people yelled at me that I was not good at my job, that I was an idiot.  It was my second day on the job and there were extraordinary circumstances that made it such that the process I'd been shown the day before didn't work anymore and caused complete chaos. There was no one else to help me. There were a few of the people who pitied me more than anything and told me that with time, I'd grow a thicker skin. I had to, if I wanted to survive at this job.

At first, that's what I did. I vowed to become a Better Employee. And over time, I became a good, resourceful, trustworthy employee. I learnt to deal with Karens, even though it always affected me deep down.

But no matter how good an employee I became, the screaming never stopped.

I had very specific things to say to customers and if I didn't say them properly, everything could go to hell. This has made me very conscious of EVERYTHING I say AT ALL TIMES because now I feel like if I express myself wrong, anyone can just blow up at me, full Karen-mode. So at work, I became a robot, saying exactly the same, studied speeches over and over. (I know I'm not the only one doing this btw).

Now, of course, customers can forget AND/OR lie so they  would accuse me of lying or not having disclosed a detail. My bosses would second-guess me, ""are you 100% sure you specified X to Karen?"" and while I knew that I basically had a prepared speech and that it was always the same thing, I second-guessed myself too.  What if I forgot? Maybe I was distracted?

Not only that, but I wasn't alone working at the company. Of course, somebody else can screw up massively and I was the one getting yelled at. That's part of the job. While I could somewhat manage my performance, there was little I could do about any other factor. Over time this left me feeling helpless.

Eventually, I came to my senses and realised that no matter how good I was, I would never be ""good enough to not get yelled at in a customer service job."" So I quit.

So what now? Here are a few things that I realised:

- I have somehow developed a bit of a stutter?! I didn't use to stutter as a child or as a teenager. Yet now I have a hard time stringing a sentence together without stuttering.

- When I make a little mistake or say something wrong, I fully expect people to blow up at me. No room for discussion or even arguing, I expect the explosion. I'm shocked when I'm met with understanding and kindness. I feel guilty. I tend to apologize a lot. I just... Don't feel like I know how to talk anymore. I can hardly become a robot in everything I say at all times.

- Double and triple checking EVERYTHING. Did I really lock the door? Have I really uploaded the right document? Reading and rereading my emails before I send them, making sure there isn't a typo or I don't come across as too rude. Checking after I sent the email ""did I send the email to the right person?!"".

I don't really know what the point of this post is.  Anyone else feels like customer service fucked them up?

All I know is that I'm 100% behind all the fast-food employees walking out of their jobs, leaving bosses to whine about ""no one wanting to work anymore."" They aren't paid enough to deal with people's BS.",False,osvakf,BadaSBich22,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/osvakf/i_think_working_in_customer_service_has/,21,1

695,I've had over 70 different jobs in the last 23 years. Still haven't found what I'm looking for.,"I started in fast food at 15. Summer jobs. Weekend jobs. Slowly building up experience and skills. Tried secretary work, construction, electrician, landscaping. Often working 2 or 3 jobs at a time. Always fell back to working in kitchens because I was good at it and the work was easy to find. Even though I move around a lot and switch jobs frequently, I am always super hard working and often the strongest employee on the team. I sacrifice a lot for my job. Need me to work late? No problem. Take more responsibility with no extra compensation? Sure, I guess so. 16 years of kitchen experience. Grinding my way from dishwasher to sous chef to manager. My pay going up but always with more stress and responsibilities. 

I open my own food truck and I now work even more with more responsibilities and hours and less pay. The food truck gets stolen and destroyed.  I try getting kitchen management jobs and no luck. Get a terrible line cook job and quit after a month. I decide to take a break from kitchen life and do warehouse work. Entry level position and I'm making almost as much as I did as a manager. I have to move again to take care of aging parents. Another terrible kitchen job, this time it's Sous Chef but the owner is clueless, fires all kitchen staff but me because sales plummet during the pandemic. After nine months of running a kitchen entirely by myself, I start having mental breakdowns, waves of anger and depression I hadn't experienced before. I'm doing prep, all the cooking, inventory, running food, busing tables, and all the dishes EVERY DAY. I explain this to the owner and does he say, ""lets hire some help.""? Does he offer to come in and help? No, he says ""Well, there's nothing I can do about it."" I put in my 2 weeks. 2 days into my second week my wife has a stroke. In tears on my way to the hospital I call the owner to let him know and he tells me not to bother completing the rest of the week. Chewed up and spit out and little to show for it. 

I had started flipping stuff on eBay a year ago as a hobby and was good at it. Started running it as a business. Working over 40 hours a week from home. Not making much, but it's enough to pay the bills, hospital and doctors bills start rolling in. Ebay doesn't care about seller's issues. Sketchy eBay practices make me question if it's even ethical to funnel the 13% of all my sales to these corporate devils. Took work as a porter for apartment complexes.

I thought that was weird since all the jobs I worked at paid overtime when you work anything over 40+ hours a week or over 80 hours a pay period. Unless there is some loophole or something I’m not seeing with labor laws, I’m probably being exploited and not getting my full wages. I’m going to report this to the U.S department of Labor to get my lost wages and have them investigate to see if it’s happening to other people within this small business monopoly they have going on.

697,I work for a certain chain of ‘charitable’ thrift stores.,"     I am a cashier soon to be promoted to assistant manager. Ive only worked here for less than three months and booooy oh boy. Theres a lot to unpack here.
     To get things started on my first day with the store office somewhat to myself, I decided to learn the surroundings of the spot. You know… where all the important papers are supposed to go, what order to file the docs in… all that stuff. Just so I know for the future if there is one to be had. 
      I found this packet that was filed separately from some other docs all by itself. Most docs that im not allowed to read have that clearly stated at the very top and that was not there so I figured hey why not skim through.
      It was exit interviews from every employee that quit our store in the whole year of 2020. You may think, “hm there cant be a lot of them right? Its just one store.” WRONG… I counted 19 of them. All but one of them had the exact same reasons for leaving. They might as well have been exact duplicates of each other. 
      -“Store manager is obnoxiously rude and intentionally pressured me into quitting by harassing me constantly and sabotaging my work.” 
      -“Store manager cursed and screamed at me over me simply doing my job the way she had previously told me to do it.”
      -“Store manager made fun of me to other employees and insulted me directly about my disability.”
      All these and more of similar kind. I mean shit ive only worked there a short time and ive already witnessed very similar situations on several occasions. There are four regular customers who all refer to her as ‘the witch’. 
      She even tried it with me but i never stand for it. When she starts her barrage of insults I just cut her off mid sentence and explain why i was doing whatever it was that got her frustrated. 
       For instance i called for a cash drop over the radio specifically to her. She never showed up. I was busy with customers so it ended up being an hour and a half before I decided fuck it, the cash has to go into the safe and im not waiting all day to do it. And i went back to the office and did so myself while she was fuming about me leaving the sales floor for a measly 36 seconds. Yes i timed it im very anal about time. 
       “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WI-“ she began to say before i cut in with “cash goes in the safe, youve made me wait long enough.” She just did her trademark ™️ grunt/growl thing she does cuz she knows shes barking up the wrong tree with me. 
        Not to mention she has directly referred to me as slow, stupid, and useless to my face and told another employee that i act like a serial killer when im just plain quiet by nature. 
There were 24 customer complaint records from 2020 as well. she is also refusing to hire on the now missing help that we need. Dividing up the work AND HOURS from the now gone employees to all the other staff. None of us except her have had one week of normally scheduled hours with no overtime since the day I started. Our cashiers are doing 47 hours a week while doing the stocker work, janitor work and store boss’ own side work on top of the cashier stuff too.

In summary, D is a spiteful and rude old crone that needs to choose between no longer treating her employees like slaves or just hanging up her whip and retiring so that maybe we can calm the fires shes set alight in peace.

&gt;The rate of households homeschooling their children doubled from the start of the pandemic last spring to the start of the new school year last September, according to a new U.S. Census Bureau report released this week.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last spring, about 5.4% of all U.S. households with school-aged children were homeschooling them, but that figure rose to 11% by last fall, according to the bureau’s Household Pulse Survey.  
&gt;  
&gt;The survey purposefully asked the question in a way to clarify that it was inquiring about genuine homeschooling and not virtual learning through a public or private school, the Census Bureau said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before the pandemic, household homeschooling rates had remained steady at around 3.3% through the past several years.

When I got a job offer for a position parallel to my own but with better pay (35k p/year to 44k p/year), I was excited for a minute. Now I'm at the new company, and it's become clear to me that for more money they require a lot more work. Like, more than 9k justifies IMO. I'm completely spiralling, just feeling so deeply burned out about learning a new arbitrary way of doing stupid arbitrary things. I hate working. Full stop. I have natural talents in art and music, but I never pursued them because I always got told ""get a real job and do your hobbies in your free time"". Excuse me, WHAT free time???? I don't understand how anyone is expected to live a fulfilling life this way and I feel completely hopeless staring down the barrel of doing this same stupid shit the rest of my life. What is the point of making yourself into an automaton 40 hours a week minimum? I want to be a human being! I have a modest side hustle teaching Suzuki Piano, but even that is falling by the wayside as I struggle to exert enough energy daily to please my new overlords. I would love to quit my job and teach piano full time, but the lack of insurance and the fear of losing a steady paycheck stop me. After all, isn't our entire worth in this country measured by our net worth? Advice appreciated, but long-term solutions will probably be ignored as I'm on the brink of a breakdown right now. Naturally, can't afford to talk to my therapist because even though I've been steadily employed my entire adult life I'm still in my 90 day probationary period and don't have insurance again yet.

731,How do you teach yourself not to feel like you MUST be productive all the time?,"The background: I've had a job since I was 14 (31 now). I own my own business and have fallen into a rut of frequently working up to 80 hours a week. It's causing me panic attacks and negatively impacting areas of my life that are very important to me. I'm actively trying to change my life to be less work-centric. We have had some financial struggles though, so I have to be pretty thoughtful about how I go about this.

 My husband and I are planning to simplify our lives in the next few years. I intend to sell my business and my house, use the cash to pay off our debt, and buy a plot of land. We'll build a smaller home there, doing a lot of the work ourselves to keep costs low. I know I'll have to work a bit eventually, but I intend to take some much-needed time to ""find myself"" again and decide who I want to be moving forward. 

My question is how the hell do you even begin to strip away nearly 20 years of capitalist, productivity-centric conditioning? I used to enjoy working hard at things like gardening and home projects. I liked to produce things like short stories and poems. I liked to be physically active lifting weights and doing yoga. I liked to help people by volunteering. I LOVED to learn and read and grow as a person. Point being, I know I'm not lazy and can keep myself very busy without a job, but I'm struggling to untangle the concepts of working to PRODUCE and working to feel fulfilled from one another. I don't want to just replace a job with new projects, even if they're ones I enjoy. I don't want to turn my passions into just anther job. But I feel lazy if I allow myself to rest or basically be a damn human, aimlessly living for any length of time without some goal.

I think meditation will help, as well as taking the time I badly need to rest and recover, but I'm also curious to hear your take. How do you go about getting outside of your programming and losing that anxious, guilty voice that tells you that you must always be busy?",False,orph2l,EmmaDazee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/orph2l/how_do_you_teach_yourself_not_to_feel_like_you/,7,1

Then we had covid in the office and nobody told me for months.
Then we reopened to the public and nobody even told me to unlock the doors.  I just kinda figured it out when I realized the “knock on the window for service” signs were gone.
Then my boss told me the owner is opening the gym and he won’t even put up a sign suggesting people wear masks in the lobby.
He makes them bring a 2nd pair of shoes to protect the treadmills from sand.
He had a sign custom made asking people to be dry and dressed when leaving the pool
because of the business office.
But he won’t put up a sign asking people to wear a mask in the lobby to protect the staff so they can be open so people can use the pool and gym.
They would because they’re not jerks, but he won’t even suggest it.

735,"Any Methods for an ""Easy Exit""?","Hi everyone,

Ever since I started working (saddest day of my life), I live for only one thing: early retirement. It is my dream (probably literally a dream as it is nearly impossible to happen). I set the bar at 40 which means that when I'm 40 that's it no more work no matter how easy or casual it is. I'm 25 now. I've been thinking of ways that could provide additional gain and let you retire early and so far none of them is valid. Here are the ways I come up with.

**Inheritance:**

You most probably know whether your parents or grand-parents are wealthy or not by now and if they are not, then this is not applicable. So, pure luck.

**Lotto:**

Pure luck.

**Sports Betting:**

Pure luck.

**Gambling:**

Pure luck. 

**Start Your Own Company:**

Start your own business, develop an app or a mobile game (or anything) and once it's a hit, sell your company for millions of dollars and retire. It is capitalism at its finest until you become a hit (many sleepless nights and perhaps losing your morals) and becoming a hit from billions of apps requires even more luck than above.

**Live on Welfare:**

Not valid if you are from a failed third-world country where even upper middle class barely survives. Could be a seriously valid option if I was European.

**Organizing for Anti-work movement and becoming successful:**

Work abolished for all. It is so impossible that I can't even dream or imagine it.

**AI Revolution so no need for human labour:**

If this happens, basic income will probably be so low that everyone will fight for open rare human positions so not a solution and nearly impossible to happen.

**Work Really Hard to Save Enough Money:**

Your boss can retire thanks to you and you can continue your slavery.

**OnlyFans:**

This is geniunely valid, in fact, it is the most sensible option. If I start now (25) and do it for 15 years, it is possible to earn and save serious money. Sadly, I am a male and with a fat body so no chance for me (who are attracted to these qualities are minority so not enough saving). And again, everyone joins OF nowadays so fierce competition with millions like apps.

**Suicide:**

For all the ways I come up with, this is the only one that retire me at 40. Perhaps I should aim to have enough courage at 40 instead of saving money.

**F\*\*\* Up World:**

With global warming (or anything else, you name it), the world is so shit that everyone's goal will become to find enough water and to survive. No more work. This is the second most realistic option (see below for the most realistic one) but not sure if I prefer this to work (I could, ask me on a bad day).

**Reality:**

Work under someone until you are 70 and then die.

So that's it. No way out. This could be a shitty post and if you consider it to be, I apologise from everyone. But I seriously can't think of a way to be out from work.",False,orwv6q,dondadondadonda,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/orwv6q/any_methods_for_an_easy_exit/,12,1

765,“A Working Stiff’s Manifesto” by Iain Levison is hilarious and highly relatable for anyone who has worked a minimum wage job. (Excerpt in comments),"

“That night, Rocker and I start closing the displays down at ten to eight. Zoe comes over and screams, “Eight o’clock! That’s when we close! Eight o’clock! Refill the ice tubs!”
I have already emptied two ten-gallon ice tubs, and she wants me to refill them for the final ten minutes of the shift. This involves going downstairs to the ice machine, a process that takes ten minutes. By the time I’m done, it will be eight o’clock.
I shrug and go downstairs and refill the ice tubs and throw the ice away as soon as I have returned to the fish stand.
“Good,” she says.
“It’s just going to get worse,” Rocker says, while he takes a wrapped pork loin, slides it down his pants, and winks at me.
And so I learn to steal stuff.

I’ve been there long enough to know where the cameras are, and I devise a system. One of my jobs is to use leftover fish to make free samples of various dishes, which I leave out for the customers to give them ideas on how the fish can be prepared. This job requires that I wander around the store and take items off the shelves, sauces and marinades, and take them back behind the counter, away from the cameras, to use in the preparation of the dish.
I wander around the store and grab anything I can get my hands on. I grab soy sauce, bags of coffee beans, yogurt, chocolate bars, more pens, and stockpile them in the back at the end of each shift. I grab tape, staples, even fish knives.
Most of all, I grab fish. I wrap one-pound chunks of Chilean sea bass up in three layers of plastic and stuff it down my pants every night on my way out the door. Rule one is nothing ever goes in my duffel bag. Management reserves the right to search the duffel bag at any time. Everything goes down the pants.

Before long, Corey and I are eating sixteen-dollar-a-pound sea bass and salmon like it’s a bag of Doritos. We have langostinos in cream sauce, lobster tails on a bed of saffron rice, Pacific red salmon and Alaskan king crab legs mixed with jumbo Maryland scallops, a gigantic seafood extravaganza served on a nightly basis. 

Soon my roommate is begging for burgers. So I talk to Rocker and arrange a trade-off at the butcher stand. We go to two-inch-tall cuts of New York strip steak, filet mignon, big wads of hamburger meat, dry-aged rib eye, even a rare cut of Kobe beer-fed beef. Every time Zoe makes a comment to me that I deem to be less than positive, more things go down the pants.”

766,Existential crisis,"I'm 25 years old, finishing a Social Sciences degree of 6 years, with some knowledge of programming languages, double citizenship. And I don't know what to do with my life. Time is over. Time to start wage-slaving, time to enter toxic office spaces and waste my days producing wealth for some rich asshole so I can get enough to luckily live somewhat comfortably. It doesn't feel worth it. My life has no meaning. I'm alone, scared, anxious, depressed, afraid of people and commitment. I don't have an official diagnosis but I suspect being on the autism spectrum. I don't know how I would be able to face life, to cope with adulthood now that I don't have any chances to hold back the job search anymore. This is it, and nothing has prepared me to face such a bleak existence. People don't understand this when I try to talk to them, they usually think I'm just a failure, a worker bee who should be crushed and molded by the system; or that I'm lazy, or that I'm immature.

I just don't know how to cope with this. I have lived abroad for a year, and the experience at work was depressing. I still remember it and cringe. I can't socialize properly, I doubt my abilities constantly, I don't think I have any special skills or knowledge that would be useful to anybody. I just don't know where to start.

The worst part is that I'm extremely conscious about the world, about our ridiculous fetishistic system, about the overconsumption paired with not having simple necessities met, about having to give 60% of my salary to some leech to have four walls around me while I sleep. About 8 hour workdays, constant competition, unemployment, when our technology level has progressed so much. I feel so alienated, so little, not as a human, but as a robot, a ghost, a joke. We have lost all relation to nature, to each other. Every person is so superficial, so drawn by money, status, academic success, prestige. I just can't do it anymore, man. I think of suicide daily, when I go to sleep I pray to God never to wake up again. It may sound so stupid, so capricious, but I can't cope, I can't sustain this life, and there's no fucking alternative, no purpose, no will and not even any determination to go against the current. I'm defeated, destroyed, all my creativity faded away, I remember writing stories, drawing, playing with toys as a kid, and being so happy with so little, being fascinated about the universe, life on Earth, history, structures, machines, and yet all of that means nothing when you see what an absurd existence this has become, how humanity managed to make ""coping with life"" a common phrase, and how my own will to live is being zapped away, never to come back. Ultimately, I'm depressed about ending up like this, such a pathetic loser, unable to cope, unable to work on his dreams, because I have none left. I have no ideas, no talents, nothing else. I'm dead. I should have killed myself when I had the time, now I don't know if I could even do that. A corpse walking, faking it, pushing through useless assignments and tasks until I eventually die by my own hand.

Things are hard, man, there's something rotten about our existence, about these times, something I can't describe well, a sort of death of utopias, of dreams, that leaves us with resentment and depression.

771,Forcing employees to work 112 hours a week is inhumane and needs to be stopped.,"Backstory : I work at one of the largest Steel Mills in the US located in Pennsylvania. We work 21 turns or 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Because production must go on, our employers are allowed to ""force"" us to work overtime to fill open turns due to call offs or understaffing.

This was fine when we were slow and they allowed open turns to go unfilled. However, they upped the workload and now are requiring all turns to be filled. We are massively understaffed. In a department of 14 guys, we had 40 overtimes. This meant not all turns were even able to filled even with forcing. They suddenly started forcing us from home so we even lost our days off. 

This means that they are able to force you to work 16 hour days, 7 days a week. That is equivalent to 112 hours of a 168 hour week.

Obviously, this is dangerous. People are forced to get lessened sleep and I alone, living about 45 minutes away, am able to get 4 hours of sleep after eating, showering, and saying hello and goodbye to your loved ones. That in itself is the worst part. I've went days without seeing my wife. It is hard on an individual.

There is no governmental or state laws and regulations against this. I'm writing this to make people aware. Everyone is seeking a cause nowadays, and this is as good of one as any.

The latest one that got me was when everyone jumped down this one redditor’s throat on s/upliftingnews for merely pointing out that she/he didn’t think a $2,500 give-away from a $4billion autoshop company was “particularly significant.” Which is true given that the said company gets a tax write-off, cheap publicity from it, AND the money given away would still have to used back at their store.  smdh.  

While our society coddles wealthy corporations with social welfare and bailouts, and  the rich gets away with not paying fair taxes, ppl are busying themselves fighting over the tiniest of tiniest of crumbs, and kissing and stroking the wealthy’s ass while they’re at it—— when is this ever going to change??? 😩

\*\*That Sick Little Hope\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tiny blemishes &amp; slight swelling

beneath the skin, found while showering

or scratching an itch, all simply signs

of aging.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet with each new discovery,

the blossoming of that sick little hope,

that this is it, illness has found

its way into my system. That years of

poor self-care have finally paid off, and

I'll no longer have to punch in

at a time clock, throw my days away

for little more than a pocket full of dimes.

&amp;#x200B;

A crippling accident or natural disaster

would do just the same, just as long as I'm

left with one good hand &amp; no one is hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't watch a zombie film without

feeling a tinge of jealousy. Society splintered,

no one having to pretend to smile for

an unappreciative public, sacrifice time

with family &amp; friends. Their threats constant

&amp; identifiable, actually worth losing

sleep over.

&amp;#x200B;

All these obligations &amp; deadlines,

the endless hours spent earning for homes

we're never at, to pay for babysitters

we wouldn't otherwise need. The reward

so little, it's preferable to be maimed or

ill, to be decommissioned. Should we all

crash into guard rails, sleep in vats

filled with DDT?

&amp;#x200B;

But what would the ruling classes

do with us then? Only one can live off

Unfortunately, its also all I’m qualified to do, and jumping ship isn’t really feasible for me right due to reasons we’re all familiar with: Need the insurance, need the paycheck, etc. 

But, I’ve done this same song and dance for too long now and have reached a breaking point. Somethings got to give. I’m tired of having my job and livelihood threatened if I miss a day because we have to work crazy shifts for dumb reasons. I’m tired of holding on to these jobs in fear of losing health insurance, and I’m tired of working for a shit company that pollutes and destroys the planet and doesn’t even offer that great of a service. And, as I’m sure you all know, the insurance sucks anyway and the pay still sucks for how much labor we do. 

There are so many issues tied together in this country that make it seem impossible to make change, but it’s simply not going to happen if we don’t take action. I get that we all need to be more proactive in voting, but even that system has gotten so corrupt it feels futile to toss your ballot in and just hope it works. I’m not the smartest guy around, and honestly don’t know much about the bigger picture of things, but I do know theres a better way to all this and I want to find people like me who are ready to roll their sleeves up and try and put in some actual work to make some changes.

I went to college to get away from labor intensive jobs, got a STEM degree in a field that interests me and that I would even say I have passion towards, and now work a full time job in the field I graduated in. Sounds like I'm successful right? Unfortunately I'm pretty miserable. I went on a 3 day work trip last week out of state, doing extremely labor intensive work in the sun for long days, albeit still somewhat science based. And besides that, I just hate the 40 hour work week, especially with overtime. The money is not a driving force for me other than being necessary to eat and keep a roof over my head. Yet again it seems as though I'm just being used as a pawn while the people in management make significantly more for significantly less work. I make none of my own decisions involving the work I do, nor the schedule I have. I'm exhausted at home and have no energy to do the things I actually care about. 

TL;DR It's taken so much time, money and work just to get to this point, and yet I hate my job. One that many people I went to college with are currently struggling to obtain.

I am a mid-30s professional single parent with two school-age kids &amp; recently lost my job of 3 years out of nowhere. My boss had spent much of that time treating me like the scapegoat of all her problems and enjoying the high school maturity of the office staff anytime she could gossip and bully her “least favorites” on our team.

I have a massive mortgage bc I live in one of the highest COL areas in the US. I cannot sell my home bc anything similar or even smaller would cost me even more to buy or even to rent. I have no potentially rentable room in my home. Other than the mortgage I have no debt. I have few bills to pay and I’m at the point of *needing* very few new things except what my kids need when they outgrow things.

I *love* having time with my kids and experiences like tending to our garden and flowers, cooking, hiking, public library, etc. The idea of going back to work again for someone who may treat me like garbage again makes me want to vomit.

839,"Ape, Together Strong. How I've setup my upward spiral, my advice and plans for a more hopeful future."," 

I am still currently poor, but I believe I've reached the beginning of my upward spiral. Below I will go over all of the things I’ve learned and the steps I’ve taken to feel that I’ve finally reached my upward spiral and ideally you’ll be able to take away a fraction of the hope for the future I currently feel. It’s a long read, but I promise every word will be invaluable to you and well worth the time.

The first thing you'll need is a ""partner in crime"", a homie or significant other who will stick by you through thick and thin. Someone you can trust with your life and truly meld brains with. We formulate our thoughts through conversation. You may think you've thought hard about something until you begin to talk to someone else about it and realize there are some holes. The other person might show you the holes with their questions or you might find the holes as you talk about your ideas. The other person may even have the answers or exact perspectives you need to crystalize your thoughts and ideas into concrete plans. (this accounts for the reason I’m taking the time to write this out and post it for you all to read and criticize.)

The other reason for needing a ""partner in crime"" is that things are just expensive and it's easier to make rent with 2 people in a 2 bedroom apartment than it is for 1 person to make rent in a 1 bedroom apartment. Or better yet 3-4 people in a 2 bedroom. This leads into the next point.

Get your monthly expenses as low as humanly possible. Cancel your subscriptions like gym memberships, streaming services, amazon prime, and buy used cash cars to avoid $250 car payments. (hell, until 3 months ago I didn't even have a phone plan and was just using messaging apps). Cut your entertainment funds. Stop buying games, movies, going out to bars, and things like that. You can afford the occasional thing here or there, but really keep an eye on this one if you're like me and like to play tons of games and have fun in general. Find ways to enjoy yourself as cheaply as possible. 

Once you've done this you'll start to realize that most of your money is going into your belly. At this point take note of what your most expensive eating habits are. If you eat out a lot like I do then try to eat out less, go to less expensive places, order the cheaper options, or cook from home whenever you can. If you eat a lot of snacks or drink sodas, start cutting back until you can go without them completely. If you've got some fat to ""spend"" then you can even try skipping meals, so long as your energy levels stay manageable and your mood doesn't suffer a hit. (when I haven't eaten enough I'm incredibly irritable and my thoughts about the future and myself become purely negative). That’s how you end up falling off the wagon and going back to bad habits due to a lack of care and energy to stay on track.

Vices are the next thing to go. To be completely honest I had an awful dependency on smoking weed. To the point where I was smoking 2-3 bowls every 2 hours when I wasn't at work. I was spending $100 every two weeks on weed and all it was doing was killing my motivations and ruining my mood. I thought it was the only thing keeping me going, when in fact it was the only thing holding me back. So, figure out your vices be it weed, alcohol, cigarettes (which I also smoked on the hour), etc. And start cutting back until you can go without them completely. I’m still vaping nicotine, but that’s much less life ruining than the other vices and has less health related issues.  

Cutting your vices is hard work and you can only do it if you replace them with other healthier habits. To stop smoking weed I had to start exercising every day to get the endorphins and good feelings that weed was artificially supplying. It's truly only been about 20 days since I decided to make this change and I feel like a completely different person. I feel unstoppable. I attribute this completely to exercising every day. It's not even about losing weight or becoming stronger which hasn't happened for me yet and I don't care if it does. It's all about sustainability and being able to do it every day. Research shows your IQ begins to slowly deteriorate after the age of 24 (I'm almost 29) and the only way to prevent that is exercise.

Ok, so now you've got your ducks in a row. Your cost of living is as cheap as possible, your mental and physical health is better than it's ever been, you have a support system in your partner, and you can begin to plan your ascension. 

For me this meant looking at my potential and the potential of those around me. Giving up on childish goals and dreams that simply aren't in the cards at this time and looking at the real opportunities presenting themselves before me.

Let's face it. We're still poor despite everything we’ve done so far, (and I'm too old to start a 4-10 year college career), so going back to college is currently out of the question. Besides, we know that doing that doesn't even guarantee a well paying job and it definitely guarantees excessive amounts of debt which you may carry until you die. But, what we can do is look at the skills and abilities we've acquired so far. As well as the skills and abilities of the friends and family we've managed to surround ourselves with. 

This is where the magic happens. (Apes, together, STRONG) This is also where my advice becomes a bit more specific to my situation, but you can apply this same concept to your own situation. 

After looking at myself and my partner/friends/family I realized we had a unique opportunity to attempt to open a restaurant. To illustrate this I'll give you a quick breakdown of all the parties involved. 

Me: 6 years of restaurant experience doing prep work, line-cook, cashier. and more recently 3 years of experience as a Graphic Designer at a sign shop doing logos, making menus for restaurants etc. 

My Partner: 3 years of barista experience, 2 years restaurant experience as a cook. Countless hours of experience home cooking and a knack for making recipes, coming up with ideas to cut food costs, and a passion for waste free business models.

Best Friend 1: The same 6 years of restaurant experience as I have, prep, line-cook, cashier, in addition to food truck event planning, bartending, and a quick wit with outside the box thinking and charisma to spare.

Best Friend 2: Same restaurant experience as me, in addition to sushi chef. Rock solid work ethic and the ability to work long hours, late nights, bleeds charisma and has a personal gravity that attracts loyal friends. 

Best Friend 3: Also same restaurant experience as above, diamond solid work ethic and the ability to work insanely long hours. Asks the tough questions and the ones you didn't know you needed to answer.

Friend 1: tons of shift lead experience at many high volume restaurants, heavenly customer service, and an absolute pleasure to be around and work with. A magnetically friendly person with positivity to spare. A morale boon to any company.

Partner’s Friend 1: studying to become an Engineer, but currently working at a smoothie/health food place with my Partner. Great work ethic and a go get em attitude ready to take on responsibilities. Currently handles food orders, inventory, and shift lead at her job, getting paid peanuts.

My Mom: Currently working at the sign shop I used to work at (I’m currently jobless) as a CSR. Making little money, doing the work of two people. Master home cook, overflowing with compassion, adamantium + fast healing work ethic. An absolute shining example of human potential.

Friend Business owner: The owner of the restaurant that all of the above “best friends” and myself previously worked for (about 6 years prior) He had to close the place due to slimy investors breaching their contract and a two faced business partner. He’s currently working on his passion project of making a video game and has been for the past 5 years. He still owns the name, its recipes, and has made the offer to let us use them. Invaluable advice as the previous owner about “legalese” (business lingo, tactics and mistakes to avoid). Only asking for a small slice of revenue. 

Best Friend 4: An absolute genius, had a privileged upbringing compared to our other friends and had the opportunity to go to college for computer science. Currently making the big bucks (100k+) at a tech company doing data basing. Lives a modest life with plenty of money to invest in his Best Friend’s business.

Best Friend 5: The brother of Best Friend 4. Also an absolute genius who had the opportunity to go to college to become an Engineer. Also making the same big bucks doing structural analysis. In the same situation as his brother in having plenty of money to invest in his best friend’s business. 

Friend of Best Friends 4 &amp; 5: Also a genius computer science major who just got a job at a big name tech company working on augmented reality. Assumedly making similar figures to BFs 4 &amp; 5 with money to spare, thinking about the future attempting to get to a point where he feels comfortable having children. Potential future investor as the business begins to expand. 

Partner’s dad’s step dad: Haven’t reached out to them yet, but they’re the one who helped her dad purchase the rights to his AC company. He owns hotels and is known as a fairly charitable figure to family. Potential future investor as the business grows. 

Partner’s Dad: Knows construction and is great at wheeling and dealing. He could help cut costs of remodeling and building the interior of the restaurant. 

Partner’s Sibling: Went to college for interior design. Believes in accessibility for the physically and mentally impaired. Could assist in creating a restaurant space that is both inviting and accommodating for all.

Friend 2: Working towards becoming a plumber, his father is a plumber. Invaluable when it comes to maintenance and repairs.

Partner’s Friend 2: Also works at the smoothie/health food place. Currently working to become a Paralegal. In business you gotta have someone who knows the laws and can keep you from getting burned alive by legal mistakes and bad contracts. They might not have enough knowledge to help now, but they could become a real boon in the future.

Little did I know because I was too caught up in my vices, my childish dreams, and spiraling depression that I was surrounded by opportunity and a fountain of potential split between  myself, my partner, my friends, and my family. All of this planning and insight has only taken the past 3 days since I got my life back on track, but it was built on the back of 10+ years of suffering and brutal learning experiences carried out by myself and others that have given us the perspective and wisdom to now know what the right choices are instead of the wrong ones. One step at a time progress IS possible.

Our goal is to open a restaurant similar to an employee owned company. Where every employee is making a small percentage of the overall revenue. Incentivizing them to work hard and be happy with their job knowing that all of the work they put in is coming straight back into their pockets instead of their dick head owner drinking a $500 bottle of scotch, sitting in their $1,200 jacuzzi, in the 2 acre backyard of their $1M mansion. Maybe then we’ll all be able to drink our $1 PBR in our $12 kiddy pool, in the 800sq/ft backyard of our 150-300K house. Knowing that we earned it and actually contributed value to our society and improved the quality of many peoples lives instead of just lying to ourselves like so many other business owners do about the “value” they are contributing.

840,Is this the best we can do?,"Honestly not sure if this is the right sub for this, I only recently subbed. But I wanted to get my thoughts out and I hope it will be appreciated.

Is this it? Is this all life is? Over 200,000 years of human evolution and it has led us to this. Back in the day times were hard, don’t get me wrong, our primary focus was to survive. We would spend all day on the hunt hoping that we could get a kill so our family would eat for the day. Back at home, others would collect water and scavenge for any vegetables, plants or edible mushrooms they could find as well as making tools to make the next hunt more successful. If this was all achieved in a day it was celebrated and then we would have another go the next day, hopefully improving and being truly innovative. This was the early humans life for the majority of our existence. It is our ability to survive that propelled us to be the dominant species in the planet. Where did it all go wrong? A system has been created that taps into our innate ability for survival (we survived the ice age for Christ’s sake) and turned it into a profit generating machine for the elite. Rather than go out on the hunt to feed your family, we go to work to feed our family, long days tracking animals are replaced with spreadsheets and zoom meetings. But rather than simply survive another day and carry on as out ancestors used to do, this desire and survival mechanism has been monopolised to profit those above us. Every day that you achieve your goal and live another day, someone else is profiting from your survival. Families and multitudes of generations profit from your very existence and from the existence of your children and from your children’s children. What the hell has happened to the most dominant species on the planet, head bowed saying yes sir no sir, please don’t fire me sir. We have accepted this as the norm, but why? We are the only species that pays to live on this planet. What if we decide not to?",False,os5h91,spacecause,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/os5h91/is_this_the_best_we_can_do/,3,1

843,I want to quit my job,"I know that it is not a very interesting title to this, but here's why:

About two weeks ago, I went to a staffing agency to look for a job.  Specifically, I went there in response to a clerical position they said they had open.  After dealing with the BS that comes with temp agencies, I was told that the position that they had available paid...a whopping $12 an hour.  It was downtown and  I could get there by bus.  I would be breaking down (read: reorganizing) leases from the local housing authority (a.k.a. the Housing Choice Vouchers, known as Section 8), and they needed someone.  Well, I needed a job mainly because I have back rent to pay, as well as other bills that are coming due.  I was due there the next day.  If this was the end of the story, I wouldn't be writing this.

I didn't realize that it would be the start, not the end, of my problems.  The first morning that I was there, I couldn't get in.  The reason?  It required a FUCKING BADGE to get in the door!  I eventually ended up getting someone who worked there to let me in.  It also required said badge to get on the elevator.  You know, the one the staffing agency didn't BOTHER TO TELL ME ABOUT?  I bring it up to the person I was supposed to report to, and the next thing out of her mouth was, ""No one gets in the first time.""  If I didn't have bills to pay, I would have turned back around, quit, and given the staffing agency an earful about said job.

At any rate, the job itself is easy.  The problem is everything else, including gossiping bitches who have nothing better to do than to talk smack about the ""clients"" of the housing authority.  I am so desperate to leave, but I am not willing to be homeless to do so.  Quitting this job would leave me time to interview for jobs that actually pay.  In my case, I am preparing to go into tech as a software QA engineer, but I can't do it while taking these low paying, good-for-nothing temp jobs that hate you the moment I take a day off to interview, or do anything for that matter.

Also I am not a day person, as in, I don't like having to go in at 7-8 in the morning just so I can have a job that takes away time I could be using, doing literally anything else other than wage slave for pay that doesn't even come close to the cost of living, even in so-called ""affordable"" areas of the United States.  With all that said, should I quit my job and risk homelessness, or should I stick it out for now and pay the bills?  Any and all advice is appreciated.  Thanks!

846,Recent Reminder of Why I Hate Work,"Over the last three years I’ve been successfully self-employed and have been able to make ends meet, afford small trips, etc. Just generally live an okay life. 

On June 28th of this year I accepted a position at a company thanks to a referral from a friend which turned out to A.) Be a bait and switch and B.) Remind me just why I became self employed to begin with. This job was also in CST (I live in EST) and all schedules were set in CST, meaning I working 3:30pm to Midnight while the CST people worked 2:30pm to 11pm. 

A.) It was $16.50 an hour - not bad for a work from home position! That’s some good extra money on top of my current self-employment. The bait and switch was that after training and 90 days, you get moved to a “Pay per Experience” pay model which is a base pay of $3.25 per call, with small metric bonuses that can make that $3.25 bump up to $8.00 per call. They didn’t tel is that until our second week of training. Still, $8.00 per phone call isn’t bad, right? My first day out of classroom training and onto on-the-phone training I took 14 calls in 8 hours. 14 x $3.25 = $45.50 $45.50/ 8 would be $5.69/hr on the experience pay model. What the fuck. 

For B.) The company has horrid turnover rates for employees - part of that is that they track metrics (for the bonuses I mentioned above) through software. My first day on the phone I didn’t make a specific offer but to only 15% of the people I spoke with - the offer rate is supposed to be 85% or higher. No biggie I thought, I’m still in training, I’m just now learning how to navigate the tools and I’ll incorporate the offer in future calls once I have this down. Boy was I wrong. The next day I had an email from the operations manager grilling me about job expectations. That day I went on the phones and tracked my metrics by hand, making sure I was doing everything right. I took another 16 calls, made the offer to 10 of them - that’s 62%. Great! Improvement. Right?….right? I clocked in the next day to find my offer rate was calculated at only 36% by their system. 

That morning I had woken up at 4am with severe anxiety about my shift which didn’t start until 3pm. That evening I quit because my mental health is more important than extra money, and more important that some vanity metrics to make the “team” look good. 

Yeah, I’ll make less money now… but it’s put things into perspective and reminded me that jobs are trash heaps and I’d rather make less doing what I enjoy while being happy.

860,The 5-days-in-a-row workweek is arbitrary and my body doesn't agree with it," I found that, for myself, working 4 or 5 days in a row takes its tool on my mental and physical health. I do not feel alive; instead, I'm a drone working 5 days straight, yearning for the weekends to get a break from the routine.

I decided to go ""part-time"" and only work 4 days in a week, 2 days in a row.

Mon-Tue

Off Wednesday

Thur-Fri

Off Sat-Sun

I'm a truck driver and I love what I do. But even so, working 5 days in a row was making me hate my job: I was burning out. I don't think we are meant to focus solely on one thing for long periods of time, even the things we like and enjoy.

With my new schedule, I love going to work. I come in refreshed, energetic, with a good mood. Even working 12-14 hours shifts, which are customary in this industry, don't take its toll on me.

Wednesdays, my mini-weekend, it's a ""Me day"". Get up late, make tea and a bowl of ramen. Watch youtube, browse reddit. Lay in bed and just chill, take naps. Go to the gym...or for a hike...or a bike ride. Do some light cleaning at the house, whenever I want and for how long I want.

Sat-Sun, my big weekend, I do fun family things with my wife and daughter. Go to the zoo, the water park, eat a restaurant, visit friends/family, etc

Previously, when I was working 5 days in a row, I didn't have the energy to do anything on my off days. My weekends were mostly to recover from the days I had just worked... and to get mentally and physically prepared to do it again the next week.

868,Burnout at 30,"Hey All,

Probably not an unusual story.  

I’ve been at my company for 7 years. When I first started I already knew I didn’t care for the work, but the hours were great, never brought work home with me, liked my coworkers and it was the same schedule as my girlfriend(Now wife). What I loved about this is the low stress kept my energy up and I had plenty of time to hit the gym, see friends and family and get some solid sleep. It allowed me the life outside of work that I wanted and to take care of myself.

Fast forward over the years and the workload gets more demanding and my friends slowly leave. The last 7 months have been completely miserable. My team is always short staffed and because I’m the most senior member I’m the go to for everything. I work 10-12hours a day and sometimes on weekends. I get pulled into meetings that have nothing to do with me or get asked to present on things that are new to me and still expected to make sure everything in my department gets done. I get chewed out frequently even when I express the struggles our team is facing. The company has grown from a startup to now having executives from big companies or ivy leagues that talk down to me. For my troubles they gave me a $2.50/hr raise. 

I’m so tired at the end of the day, I dont sleep well, I’m stressed out all the time and now have the fear of getting fired unless I keep this pace. We haven’t even been asked to go back to office, but we will soon(Bay Area traffic btw). To make things harder, my wife and I talked about starting a family in the next few years, but now that sounds terrible. To think I’ll be commuting for 1.5-2hours a day, working 10-12hour days and then having to take care of a child sounds miserable(My wife is understanding and wants to help me change my situation). I dont have the time or energy to exercise anymore, pursue my hobbies and I’m afraid this will be my life. I regret not going after a career I actually enjoy or something meanigful, but now I dont even know what that would be. I see my managers on at all hours of the day and night. They say this is the nature of the business and other people I talk to say I’m avoiding hard work. 

Luckily, I know I can change this as I have saved well and have no debt, but I dont even know where to start. Maybe I am lazy, but really I just wish I could work 30-40 hours a week, do a good job, go home and enjoy my life. Sometimes I wish I could just leave everything.

He’ve been at this for 4 months, testing thousands of samples and
the data you have generate will help get this vaccine fully
approved so that thousands upon thousands more can be
protected. Our days can sometimes be long, frustration and even
mundane. Our days can be hard but when put into the proper
perspective, we can see them rightly and appreciate their
importance.

Choosing your hard....

Working long days is hard.
The loss of over three million lives worldwide to COVID is hard.
Choose your hard.

Last minute changes to your assignment are hard.
Saying goodby to a loved one by Room is hard.
Choose your hard.

Someday the mundane of tube after tube is hard.
Worrying if someone you love will still be here at the end of this
anaemic is hard.

Choose your hard.

The frustration of waiting on a decision before you can start
pressing or setting is hard.
The loss of jobs, business, financial ruin — struggling to survive
is hard.
Choose your hard.

When someone pushes every button you have — it’s hard.
The cost of COVID isolation on mental health — depression &
suicide is hard.

Choose your hard.

Deep up the good work! On’t let what we do become so routine
that you forget the lives behind the tubes. Thank you for working

883,My job is toxic for me but boss gave me a raise...,"I have wrote on here a few times before about my job. This platform is like my outlet. But the basic rundown is that my boss is always gone. I am in insurance sales and its been super stressful to run the office and try to meet my sales goals You can look at my other posts. I finally took a mental health day last week and my boss asked me if I was ok the next day. I didn't want to go into it with him so I just said I needed a day off. He said ok and he wanted to talk to me about my yearly review and that he wanted to give me a bonus because he knows he is always gone and he appreciates all I do. He was going to add an extra 100.00 to my paycheck. He also wanted to talk to me because even though I sold 19,000 I lost 9,000 due to people not paying their bill or finding a better rate and canceling. So he wanted to bump up my salary so I don't feel discouraged. I appreciate him talking to me but its also been more than just my pay. It's the stress of being alone, being the only worker and stress to sell.  I also already was looking for another job not sales and I planned on moving to that. But him giving the raise makes me feel bad. There is also perks like being alone no catty co workers but other than that it can get pretty overwhelming but I also feel like good jobs are hard to find. My boss doesn't yell at me he just doesn't really work and leaves it to me and we aren't able to get anyone to work here so I feel like who knows how long it could be this way. I just feel stuck idk if i should still take the new job even if it means I will make less now. I feel like I stay I will be miserable but I also am scared to leave in case my new bosses are worse....but if I do stay here and we don't hire anyone I might be fired or let go when I don't sell enough for him or he might close...he has never had just one employee this long. But the same thing could happen at the new job also. My husband I are also trying to buy a house the original plan was to close this week on the house and then I would leave cause the new job is much closer to the house we live in and the one we would move to. But the sellers had issues with the title and we couldn't close and now we have to reapply once they let us know its fixed. The lender said it wont cause problem to change jobs I just can't have huge gaps in employment I can leave here and go there. But I do have to have 30 days of paystubs at the new job for the loan. I am just having a hard time deciding what to do next.",False,os7y53,REDHEADGIRL89,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/os7y53/my_job_is_toxic_for_me_but_boss_gave_me_a_raise/,2,1

Now, I am feeling better health wise. I've been reading, writing, listening to podcasts, and watching cartoons all day. I occasionally go out on dates too. Once I got into the swing of things just like magic I can remember my dreams. Even if I take a cat nap. Working made me less human. Lacking normal human abilities like dreaming.

925,A truck driver cannot buy back time (vent),"I’m sorry if this is long but I feel like I needed to write this down and get it off my chest.

7 years. 7 years I worked for this company and I gave it all I got. The money was good, but money cannot buy back time. My money, your money, all of the money combined in the world cannot buy back yesterday, cannot buy back last week, it cannot buy back what has already happened. Once the day is over....it’s over...

This company that I worked for was from another state. So the live in one state and work in another situation. I never went home really. I couldn’t. Even if I moved to the state I worked in, it wouldn’t have made a difference. There was no “balance”, and no personal growth. 

I worked 7 days a week, around the clock. That little 34 hour off duty reset that I get every weekend is irrelevant. I spend half of my off duty time going to a truck stop to get my trailer weighed for next week’s deliveries. And it was overweight every time. 

The shipper that my company hauled for, contributed to 75% of my burn out. I don’t know if they were clueless or did things on purpose. But it seemed as if these guys load the trailers full, go make random appointments and hope for the best that the drivers perform miracles. 

Adverse weather conditions? Forget it, trying to explain to the shipper that there’s 5 feet of snow in the interstate is like trying to teach algebra to a monkey. They got really pissy about rescheduling appointments. Dude, I’m in Upstate New York, I have 8 stops. My first stop is in Indianapolis and my last stop is somewhere in Wyoming. And I have to be back here at the yard again by Friday, so I can do the same crap all over again next week. I ran out of magic stones to perform miracles this week, can you just Effin reschedule? 

Sleep. A good sleep was something that I looked forward to everyday. A good un interrupted sleep was rare. It was very common for the shipper to schedule 6am appointments and 5pm appointments on the same day. That leaves me praying to Cthulhu and the old gods that I find parking after hours. Most of the time, my 14 hour clock has already been hit and I’m forced to drive even further. To makes things even worse, 2hrs into my sleep after an 18 hour on duty nightmare, I feel the refrigeration unit on my trailer shut off. I always make the decision of waking up and pulling my hair and teeth trying to find a mechanic at 1am when everyone is sleeping. I couldn’t force myself to just let the products rot, I had a job to do.

So the above are some of the experiences that I dealt with in 7 years, and it kept repeating itself every week.

I absolutely hate my new job and wish I didn't need one at all, but ya know, bills and food and stuff. I really want to find another job that doesn't make me as miserable, but have no idea what to do. Every time I look for jobs online, I just get depressed because any job that pays enough to actually cover bills is something I'm actually not qualified for or is for some evil empire (a bad corporation, collecting medical debt, or other bullshit evil jobs). Anything that actually looks interesting and not soul sucking, like jobs that have a positive impact, I'm not qualified for - I mean, I literally couldn't do the job even if I lied my way into it.

I have a bachelors that I enjoyed and taught me a lot, but isn't applicable to a job outside of academia (and I definitely do NOT want to do academia). I have no mechanical skills or trade certifications, and have no advanced or specialized training/degrees. I do have experience in basic IT, customer service, and barista stuff a while back. I'm good at figuring stuff out and decent with anything involving computers or research. I realize I may need to get the training to do one of the better jobs, but I'll need an interim job during the training. I also have some chronic health conditions that don't count as disability, but can make life difficult during flare ups.

My current job offers health insurance (the only reason I took it), but was a 50% paycut from my pre-covid job. It doesn't give me enough for rent so I'm living with my parents. It's a boring job with disorganized management (pretty much every day my manager and I have to call the higher ups to give me access I should already have to some program/website I need to do my job), and my first paycheck is officially late.

960,Am I trippin' or is it really this bad?,"I feel stuck and need a place to vent, what better place than here, eh?

I fell prey to Uber's horrible ""business model"" because it offered me full freedom to do whatever I wanted on my own timeline without a boss breathing down my neck. I effectively cut my work days to weekends only and it usually paid the bills, up until now. 

Uber has started taking an incredible percentage of the customer payment and it's beginning to become counter productive. While I will likely have to grind myself against the wall to make rent this month, I am now facing a delima that I have been avoiding like the plague...

I have to find a ""real job."" *queue scary music*

I have realized in my stead of avoiding real work I managed to develop an abstract anxiety towards job applications. I feel as if it would be easier dying than trying to fight corporate lingo, AI driven application systems, anybody in HR... The whole process is not only incredibly overwhelming, it feels hopeless. I feel overwhelmingly fake when filling in my resume. or talking to any sort of recruiters.

962,I know it's all bullshit and I'll never change my mind,"I had a phase where I wanted to just go on welfare, because it seemed like the closest thing to universal basic income.

Universal Basic Income should be a human right. Anything extra could be afforded through a job.

That would make most people want to work, since most people want to do more in life than just sit at home and chill, apparently. 

But it would also eliminate the threat of homelessness and starvation.

All I got when I made posts about the idea outside of this subreddit is a bunch of people calling me a leech and telling me to go off myself. People calling me worthless and all type of shit.

I'm now going to graduate soon and then I will have to get an apprenticeship. I plan to just work in a warehouse all my life, because that seems like a job with simple tasks compared to the other bullshit jobs we have in my country.

Deep down I know it's all bullshit, and I know basic needs should be provided by the government. I know all that deep down, and I also won't change my mind about this.

I just don't talk about it outside of this subreddit anymore.

Because even if I don't bring up the welfare or UBI topic, people will always find a way to call you worthless or leech or parasite, and they will also tell you to go off yourself. And that shit will start to fuck with your mental health.

So I just don't talk about it much anymore.

I'll just complete my last year of school after the summer break and then I'm glad when I get an autistic-friendly job in a warehouse.

Deep down I don't give a shit about school or work, but I'm just going to pretend I care because if I don't life will become a living nightmare.

Deep down I know it's all bullshit. Deep down I haven't changed my mind. Fuck the ""contribute to society"" bullshit.

These right wing, anti welfare fucks don't work because they love everyone around them so much. They work because they want money.

The only thing they want to contribute to is their own fucking bank account.

I think it mainly stems from the fact that I have no relevance in the job that I’m in, it’s not what I’m going to have a career in so why would I get myself worked up over something that I don’t care about? I’ve told my friends and family this and they find my carelessness rather bad which makes me feel slightly guilty but not for long. I do rather simple things in my job at the moment but they have spoken about increasing my role so I will be dealing with more customers face to face which makes me want to scream but I don’t have any excuses to not do it. 99% of my colleagues have been there at least 10 years and some have been there 35 years and I could not think of anything fucking worse.",False,or8nnf,evenforyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/or8nnf/i_dont_give_a_shit_about_my_job/,4,1

They don't care if you already requested that day off because Kathy called in sick, so you better get your ass down there pronto.

Of course, employers don't want to hire part time employees because we're not ""flexible"" enough to their liking. Flexible = allowing asshole employer to bend you over backwards. Literally.

I was never trained to teach the little kids I was barely trained to teach the older kids.  my training was getting thrown into the fire.  When I asked about getting help I was told I could come in on their time unpaid, I might add to be trained.  I could say much more, but I always told myself Im doing this for the kids and supporting them and it felt good to help them sure.

Why String Theory Is Both A Dream And A Nightmare


String theory is perhaps the most controversial big idea in all of science today. On the one hand, it’s a mathematically compelling framework that offers the potential to unify the Standard Model with General Relativity, providing a quantum description of gravity and providing deep insights into how we conceive of the entire Universe. On the other hand, its predictions are all over the map, untestable in practice, and require an enormous set of assumptions that are unsupported by an iota of scientific evidence.

Quantum immortality : How to Prove the Multiverse Exists, in the Most Violent Way Possible


Quantum mechanics says objective reality doesn't exist, that instead all we see are probabilities collapsing into one particular configuration... and all other possible realities might just exist together in a quantum multiverse. Here's the experiment that could help you to test that very idea

The twin notions of quantum suicide and immortality were first proposed by Hans Moravec in 1987 and independently a year later by Bruno Marchal, but the most work on the idea has been done by MIT's Max Tegmark. The most common version of this experiment goes like this — place the experimenter in a chamber with a life-terminating device, such as a high-powered rifle pointed at her head. Every ten seconds, the spin value of photons will be measured. Depending on the result — and there's a 50/50 chance of either measurement — the device will either fire and kill the experimenter or make an ""all clear"" noise that tells the experimenter she is safe.

What we've done here is tie the survival of the experimenter to a quantum state, meaning she now exists in a superposition of being both alive and dead. There's a 50% chance she survived the initial round, and she has the same chance for every subsequent repetition of the experiment. No matter how many times she repeats the experiment, half the time, she survives.


Of course, her overall survival chances are way less than 50%. The version of her that died in the initial experiment doesn't have a 50% chance of coming back to life in the next experiment. But each living version of the experimenter retains that chance at survival, even if the overall chance of survival keeps falling to 25%, then 12.5%, then 6.25%, and so on. Let's say that in one universe, an experimenter eventually emerges having survived 50 such tests in a row — something she has less than a one in quadrillion chance of surviving, which is way more than is needed to meet the 5-sigma level of certainty needed for an official discovery. 

Our only hope is technology that would be so far ahead of our own that it would seem like magic or divine power to the generations of yesterday but our current avenue of thought and philosophy would lead us to label it as “highly advanced technology”.

1020,Loosing my job was the best thing ever (GER),"I worked 6 years in a  IT job paying above norm.

And still....living on wellfare feels just so so much better, let me explain:

When i worked i never had time, i needet to get up early in the morning to have a 40min ride to my job.
Then spend the day there 90% browsing the internet and counting minutes untill i could go again.

Even with the 10% of time i actually had work to do...all i did was generating huge value....value for shareholders.
No real value...the product we made was obsolete compared to what china sells for half the price.

When the plant finaly shut down because some muricans buyed it for some pattents...i was finaly free.

So i whent on to stydy 4 semesters....just to have it crushed by corona.

Since then i am on social wellfare (about 2 years now).
Here in germany that means:

paid rent + pocked money

Meaning i have about 430 a month for everything...food...mobility...hobbys.

That dosent sound like much...but:

I live in Berlin...so i dont need a car.
Food....i buyed like 90kg of lentils a year ago and use them as my main calorie intake.

This leaves me with about 250 bucks a month as hobby budget.

You cant do much with that...but i allready had everything in material goods i needet (pc, snartphone, bike).

So i started to spend my budget on a 3d printer and a cncmachine.
Made myself a little shop.

And now i spend my days like this:

Waking up whenever the fuck i want.

Making breakfast whenever the fuck i want.

Enjoy the morning sun on my balcony with a coffee.

Coding opensource software when i feel like it.

Making/cuting videos when i feel like it.

Designing 3d print stuff and upload it yo comunity for free when i feel like it.


I get comments on my upload that feel better than any paycheck i ever had. 
I am giving back yo community and it feels good.


so...if i have to choose again between geting 21€/h and just having 250€/month but no work......i take no work every day!

I hope this helps you to quit your job (if u live simewhere with a social net) it can only getting better!

1031,Value and Toxic Work Culture (longish post),"I can't speak for other countries but in the US, the lack of discussion about value and people taking the time to actively define what they value enables toxic work cultures.

When cultures, and people, do not prioritize really honing in on what they value, that responsibility will get exported to the first person that wants to gain from it. I see this everywhere with how value is only conflated with money and productivity, which has been bastardized to mean the rate of which a person makes money or something that can be sold for money.  When we let companies define value, JP Morgan feels justified in spouting bullshit about how it should be expected that graduates work 72 hour weeks for 3 years in order to get to a point where they produce ""value"" for the company. All in the promise of being able to make more money for themselves and the company. If that's your jam, have fun. 

Why do I think this is important? Some people just...know what they value. At 18, they know they don't care about a six figure job, or an expensive house, or what other people consider a productive use of their time. I didn't and a lot of people don't. It usually isn't until some company grinds their fucking soul into dust that they start re-evaluating their life in the crater where their happiness and well-being used to sit. And all the while, they feel like they can't say no. It's important because companies encourage cultures where they tell young it looks bad if they use their vacation, ask about benefits, or discuss pay.

Because of the pandemic, we're seeing it now where an entire class of people were able to see one of two things. Some were able to stay home collecting unemployment and had the first chance to see the actual value of having time for things other than pre-and-post work life maintenance. The others were sadly shown, in completely unambiguous terms, that the culture we allow enables companies and the government to treat a person's economic as more important than a person's health, financial security, or mental well-being while saying they're Essential. Being essential means that a company must take what you value into consideration.

And until we do this, especially for young people about to enter into workforce, companies will abuse people becaues there will always be a fresh supply of people to abuse. People will go to college and get degrees because they're interested in the subject and not realize those industries have cultures that conflict with or outright discourage what they value. They then feel stuck between bearing a hell of their choosing or coming to terms with being tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollar in debt for a culture they hate.

This shit is preventable. These companies would either go bankrupt or be forced to change if only the people who solely valued money and titles applied to work there. We definitely need things like worker's rights legislation and pro-active regulation but, as individuals, we also need to define what we value to the extent that we know what we consider a personal right in the event that legislation never comes.",False,oqxu5d,TexasMonk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oqxu5d/value_and_toxic_work_culture_longish_post/,5,1

1042,anti-capitalist revelations,"I've finally been anti capitalism-pilled. I always knew it instinctively like questioning why the fuck we have to undergo these needlessly stressful ordeals just to get basic necessities and 'doesn't our way of life directly cause most of the depression and anxiety in our society?' Being born in a capitalist society the most I hoped for was moving to a western European country that does capitalism the least stressfully but after talking to my brother who has been recently listening to tankie podcasts he brought up a lot of points that I've been hearing about like how the wealth of the richest countries are propped up on the exploitation of poorer countries and it's fixed that way so they can never get ahead. Now moving doesn't seem so appealing. 

I've been reading anti-capitalist sentiments on here for a while but my American conditioning made me instinctively distrust them and I've always been discouraged from learning on my own because learning the truth about things always seemed an endlessly complicated and insurmountable task and 'I need to focus on finding a way to sell my labor anyways.' I struggle to read or understand history. Now I'm motivated to at least try to learn more about how the world works (based and sockopilled) so I can better articulate my ideas.

1046,Would universal basic income inflation be as bad as everyone thinks?,"Supermarkets sell budget versions of products to people who cannot afford much. Surely UBI would just make that market bigger?

The price of baked beans might go up but there would still be a market for budget baked beans. People would still be able to afford baked beans.

Also you could get rid of minimum wage with UBI so some labour prices for products would go down. 

You can justify a simpler job with UBI because you don't need it to survive.

So the labour costs needed to produce baked beans would go down if people volunteered to work for a pittance to make baked beans for something to do.

The inflation caused by central banks piling into the stock market is pretty bad. Stocks are out of reach for most workers. But there's always a market for people at the bottom and I don't think these people will be unserved by capitalism.

TlDR UBI causes inflation but it won't be unaffordable because businesses still need to make money so there would be product ranges for people in poverty.

All job descriptions sound like they want experienced people or require you to do stuff which we didn't even learn in job college (Berufskolleg in Germany).

Not to mention that they are super far away from me, cost a ton to get to a potential interview and much time because no car only bus/train is available.

I didn't even start to work and already feel like I made a mistake choosing this career which is btw being a Biological-technical Assistant (Biologisch-technische Assistentin in Germany).

The school was fun and all but I kinda think I chose biology only because it was the only thing I didn't sucked at in the past or had at least a little bit of interest in.

And as many here I don't have any real interests or am particularly good at something. I will be moving back to my parents which in itself is kinda nice but also shitty because if you don't work they will bite you in the ass saying I do nothing to find a job etc... I bet many of you experienced that as well.

I'm not sure if I'm just ranting here but advice is always welcome especially here where we all don't really wanna slave away our lives. I can relate soo good to all of you.
I'd really like to just work part time in this field but I doubt I can afford living with just a beginner wage that is 2.2k a month cut in half so 1.1k and then come taxes which in Germany are ridiculously high if you live alone and you are single.

1098,"Yeah, Retail Still Hasn’t Learned From 2020..."," 

Hey, Antiworkers. Long-time lurker, first-time poster and I really need to get this rant off my chest before I end up Googling how many ways to commit suicide with a box cutter.   

Despite the wage slave fuckery going on in this country(‘Merica) right now, I got a “part-time” job(just under 40 hours) at a generic grocery store chain. My partner is disabled and needs help paying for dental and I need seed money for my micro-business. So yeah, those are my reasons for nibbling on the 9-5 shit sandwich.  

**The Bullshit I Need To Vent About**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Drug Testing and Background Checks**\-  It’s astonishing that even with retail’s stupid high turnover rate, they still expect all their potential employees to be as clean as Mr. Rogers. Like, fuck, I’m not joining the Secret Service, I’m applying to stack boxes for $10.50/hr. If the people who do pass the drug and background check quit within a week anyway, why waste the time and money doing them in the first place? 	   
 
* **Fuck All For Training**\- Orientation was a joke. 10% of it was more paperwork, another 10% was stupid computer quizzes, a worrying 75% of it was dedicated to videos on sexual harassment(with paid actors), and the last 5% of it was how we should be worshiping the customer because they spend money in our store. None of it was about how to actually do the job they hired me for. 	The only real “training” involved me shadowing another new guy for two days before throwing me to the wolves.    
 
* **Terrible Scheduling**\-The only thing worse than the two days worth of training I got was the 	scheduling. My orientation day was 9:00AM-1:30PM and my first workday was 4:00 AM-12:30 PM the next day and for the rest of the week. Whelp, fuck my normal sleep cycle, right? No one asked if I’d need a day or two to adjust or if I wanted to start a little later in the week.    
    
 I was dead on my feet for the first few days while my body adjusted to my new senior citizen bed time. Oh, did I mention my commute is a 4 mile bike ride to and from work? All I could do after getting home from work was collapse in a sweaty heap in front of my box fan. I’m still catching up on sleep from the sudden change...  
 
* **Ultra-Entitled Customers**\- Customers aren’t usually that bad. But that just means that the few entitled ones I do get are more difficult than usual. I’ve had two customers ask that I drop what I’m doing, go back into the stock room, and bring out fresher products. Then they act miffed because the ones in the back don’t look any better. I’m lucky if they’ll even wait around at all for me to wrestle the 25-50 lb box out of the cramped stock room.  
    
  
* **The Company Has Zero Self-Awareness**\- This point isn’t unique to where I work, but I still have to vent. The pay is shit, but you wouldn’t believe it if you saw the fuck-ton of corporate propaganda littering the break room. They absolutely believe that we should be grateful to lick the crumbs 	from their asshole because of their healthcare plan and employee stock program(you can work to own stock shares, basically).    
    
 It’s like they don’t think their employees can do basic math and realize that they’d still be living in abject poverty for years, and the rest of society would still be paying for the companies’ 	stinginess(I’m still going to need to visit food banks, 	personally). Kind of hard to get hyped about a healthcare plan when the financial and physical stress from the job itself will increase my odds of needing to go to a doctor.

Turnover is so bad that there’s no point in remembering anyone’s name. Management has their heads up their asses and would rather focus on writing people up over petty things than address the issues. 	 

As a newbie, all of this tells me that there’s no point in working for your company long-term if you’re just going to end up overworked and underpaid, picking up the slack from an endless parade of newbies.   

&amp;#x200B;

* **Co-Workers Talk Like Battered Housewives**\- More than a handful of my boomer co-workers are drinking the corporate Kool-Aid. One such co-worker approached me on the first day to try and give me ‘advice’. It went something like this:  
 

&amp;#x200B;

Co-worker: “I see it all the time. They get these young people, like yourself and they’re gone in like the first week. I know the work is hard and repetitive, but you got to, uh, think of something that helps you get through 	it. See, like me, I pretend I’m a football ball player running yards. So every time, I think, ‘oh how many yards did I run today’ it’s just about the mindset, man. I know the pay isn’t great, but healthcare and benefits aren’t bad.”   

Me: Right. So, why do you think there’s such a high turnover rate?  

Co-worker: These young people don’t want to work. They want the big money, like $15/hr, but they 	don’t want to do anything.  

Me: So you think they aren’t hiring the right people?

Co-worker: Yeah, they need to really ask these people what can they do for the company and find 	out if they’re a good fit. Stuff like that.

I thought about this exchange and realized how many beats it shared with a toxic relationship. 	Rationalizing abuse/exploitation, sunk-cost fallacy, escapist coping mechanics, defending the abuser, etc. Think about it: ‘I know they ~~barely pay me enough to survive on~~ hit me, but ~~the healthcare is okay and they’ve got 	a retirement plan~~ they’re always super sweet to me afterwards. It’s hard and repetitive, but then I just go to my happy place to get through it.’  

You read about boomers being out of touch, but it’s so jarring see it in person. He worked during 2020, likely making between $10-12/hr with “appreciation pay”(5 $100 	bonuses with a $100 gift 	card), and sees nothing wrong with his situation. Worse yet, it’s like he’s never fathomed that you could make a livable wage *and* have decent benefits. Or like in a healthy relationship, have someone be nice to you and not beat you.

So that’s it. I fucking hate this job. I’m barely a week in and I’m already making it a point to work as inefficiently as I can to pad out the clock and taking my breaks back-to-back to give my body a rest. It’s not like I didn’t know how shit things were before the pandemic, it’s just ridiculous how tone deaf employers are after everything that’s happened.

I plan on dedicating a small portion of my paychecks to printing out fliers for Octoberstrike and quitting this bullshit job on the same day, if I don't walk out by the end of this month.  

**TLDR: Took a shitty back-breaking $10.50/hr retail job to help my disabled partner pay for medical expenses. Confirmed how out of touch people still are. Going to set aside money from my measly checks just to promote Octoberstrike around town.

1100,Wanting to quit but afraid my friend/coworker will get blamed if I do,"4 months ago one of my close friends got me a job working alongside him selling gym equipment for a large retailer, sending my CV to the company owner and vouching for me, I got the job before it was even advertised to the public.

Unfortunately, now that I'm settled into the job I realized just how terrible it is. To summarize the worst of it, I get paid minimum wage to do what should be multiple people's jobs because the company owner/director is a cheapass. 

I am ordered to use the warehouse forklift and arrange stock/pallets when I don't have a forklift license. Myself and another person have to deliver and lift gym equipment into people's houses that sometimes weigh over 400lbs/180kg (feel like my spines about to explode every day now) pretty sure this is violating some health and safety regulations too. Asking me to drill into concrete walls, paint and plaster in-between serving customers as I'm still expected to do my full shift duties as retail staff, the list goes on.

The icing on the cake is I recently found out that our store manager has worked here for 7 years and makes 50c an hour above minimum wage, he's asked for a raise earlier this year after doubling our sales of the previous year and he got denied.

I'm definitely wanting to quit, most companies thesedays where I live are paying a living wage for entry level jobs and the job markets never been better. 

However, when I told my friend that I'm quitting he said he's certain that management would go ballistic at him because he's the one who stuck out his head and vouched for me to get hired. 

He said he understands why I'm leaving and that I should do what's best for me but also that this will complicate things for him as management is very petty and holds grudges. He also can't afford to quit like me because he has a criminal record from when he was a teenager which would exclude him from the majority of jobs out there.

Not sure what to do, I want to give the middle finger to the owner and management, but also afraid of the repercussions it would have on my friend.

1105,"Hoping to end ""work"" for good.","I've been lurking for awhile under another account, but I've finally decided to post something on here.

I'm in my early 20's, but I've already had more jobs than most of my peers have had combined. I worked for a theme park for nearly a year, and the supervisors/managers were among the worst I've ever come across. At that time I was still a teenager, so naively assumed I was just at the wrong job.

After a few more years of job hopping, I've come to realise I despise the corporate hierarchy. All it takes is for one person to make the employee's life a living hell (and quite often there are multiple people in management positions who seem to have it out for their employees).

Next week is my last week at work. After that, who knows? I still have to earn an income somehow, and there are things I want to achieve in life.

Up until finding this subreddit, I always assumed I was the problem. I thought I was a failure for refusing to be a workaholic like so many of my peers and family members. I have serious commitment issues, and I despise the idea of working for a place for years on end, never getting any recognition or fulfillment.

Can any of you give some advice to a new member? I'm excited about the future, but it seems daunting too. I don't want to end up in another abusive/toxic environment.

1119,I almost killed a man at work and today I was told to get over it.,"I promise you this is not a click bait title! I work as a train driver, and have done for a few years now. The company is very well known.

The company is awful and rampant with sexual harassment and corruption, but that's not the story. 

A few weeks ago, a man jumped in front of my train. I don't know whether the intent was to hurt himself or what, but I managed to stop the train in time and he survived. 
There is a whooooole load of procedure to follow after something like this happens. This includes a welfare check on the driver of the train. Now, in this company the rules and procedures are there but purely for appearances to show they're giving a duty of care to their staff. In reality, these are not followed and it's about getting staff back to work as quickly as possible.


I was really shaken after the incident. I know the guy survived, but it was a big shock and a big fright. Service was suspended, all electric in the area was switched off and loads of staff had to survey the track to make sure everything was okay. 
I went into the office and was told my next train I was due to pick up was running a bit late now. They still expected me to continue like nothing had happened. I asked to please speak to someone and the managers were reluctant to give me the support that is supposed to be immediately offered after an incident like this. 

Eventually, I ground them down into giving me the support. I then went home and my manager told me they would refer me to occupational health for counselling.

So I was contacted by a OH doctor who asked me how I was doing. I told them that I had been feeling low and my sleeping had been out of whack and I've getting myself better by exercising regularly and taking care of myself. The doctor told me that taking time off for work was unnecessary for this event and asked whether I should even do this job given that I was shaken by this incident. I said that these things don't happen often and they're not really supposed to be a part of my role, they're just something that *can* happen.

The doctor then said that I should not have been shaken by this incident and that I need to develop a ""hardened resilience"" to things like this. I once again explained that this was not part of my job role, that I am not expected to have to deal with life and death situations on the regular. They're just an unfortunate thing that can happen and that's why there are procedures in place in the event that they do happen. 

The doctor said that was not reasonable and that I needed to develop a thickened skin. They then went on to say that I would not be offered counselling or any therapy due to this incident and that I need to get used to this. 

I feel myself trying to justify and explain myself here but it really isn't part of my job to deal with suicide attempts. They're extremely rare and people often go 30 / 40 years in this job never having experienced anything like this, I'm just unlucky. I now know that if anything like this happens again, I cannot allow myself to feel any way about it because I'll lose my job. I was already told that if I cannot handle people trying to kill themselves I shouldn't be in this job.",False,oq7u4q,ThrowRAsad9999,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oq7u4q/i_almost_killed_a_man_at_work_and_today_i_was/,77,1

1123,Exploit COVID for consequence free days off work.,"This won’t apply to everyone’s situation, but maybe it can help some of you get a much needed break at work, even if it’s unpaid.

Last week I got mildly sick and I had to call off a couple days at my part time job. Pretty sure it’s not COVID, but I’m taking the proper precautions just in case. Typically, when not in a pandemic, managers pressure me to take as few days off as possible or prove that I’m sick by getting a doctors note. I was surprised this time that they acted extra sympathetic about me calling off and even the possibility it could be COVID. They didn’t even ask for a doctors note…. So I said fuck it, I’m going to milk this while I can for a couple more days. I’m already feeling much better, but when they ask if I’m coming in I just bring up something about COVID, waiting for test results, how bad I feel, or that I would hate to spread it to staff/customers. That shuts them up real fast and they’ve actually encouraged me to take extra days off.

I sincerely hope none you actually get COVID and you are all healthy… but don’t be afraid to use this pandemic to your advantage if you get the chance.

1125,Just me ranting. I don't know where else to do it.,"I don't know if this is the right place to vent, but I really need to just get this out of my head.

I started the job I am at with 12 hour shifts three days a week. I figured it would give me more me time and I'd just be exhausted those three days. A week into my employment the company changed and went back to 8 hour shifts, though as of right now it is Monday through Saturday since they didn't work around needing more people to cover weekends.

I worked the full 6 day shift last week, but called in on Monday. Now it is Friday and I'm calling in again out of pure exhaustion. The job itself is very physical and very fast paced, but also one of the higher paying jobs in my area (at a whopping 15 an hour). So I have pretty much found myself not eating and basically only sleeping any time that I have free. I work 11pm to 7am go to bed around 9am and sleep until around 9 pm. I've tried so hard to get up earlier but it feels impossible.

I feel SO GUILTY for calling in two days this week. Not for the company I work for, but for my boyfriend who has worked the full week there, and other people in my home who are hella stressed about bills. I can't afford to take that many days off and the extra money from OT is super welcomed, but I can barely move my hands today from RSI and the swelling is intense.

I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. I have medical bills and car payments and rent and credit card bills from the month I was out of work earlier in the year. Not to be dramatic but I want this to stop, however it has to stop.

I'm at my wits end. Honestly I just desperately wanted to vent. It's insane that even working the hours that I do and the pay that I work for, there still has to be 3 people paying rent in my home to even afford that and the basics that are needed to survive.

1148,Capitalism makes people resent the happy poor,"I've developed this theory over my recent experiences. I am content with my poor life. And most of my friends show disdain towards my lack of materialism. Let me explain.    
I have very little material things, but enough to keep me comfortable. I currently do not work as I am enjoying government handouts, but when I will work again, with my current government-housing low rent, and very limited eastern european diet, will allow me to only work 15-20 hours per week to be able to make all ends meet. I do not have a car, do not take public transport, and my ideology is, if I can't walk to it, I can't go. (I love walking, and I walk 7-10km daily).   


Most of my friends work 40+ hour weeks. They drive the latest car, have the latest iphone, but struggle to pay rent, but THEY JUST NEED that new bag. This situation is not their fault, they were conditioned to be this way by the violent capitalism we live in. However, they were also conditioned to look down on anyone who doesn't ''hustle. who doesn't ''grind''. i always get told, ''you love painting, why not sell them? you embroider, make custom art!'' or, ''you can't live live like this forever, one day you'll want to buy a house, or travel!''  


  
And my answer is no, I do not wish to capitalize my hobbies, and no, I do not particularly wish to own a house, and if I can't travel to a place with modest savings, I'm not interested.   


  
And it literally makes them mad. I believe this comes from their capitalistic conditioning.

Then today I called in sick and they called me and fired me but said I was fired for ""insubordination, and I wasn't fired for calling off"". Because they know me calling off is covered by ADA... I was the highest paid employee in that store and worked the most hours and because I told them about my struggles and tried to have flexibility and openness with them they fired me.

1160,A troubling thought (premonition?) of how the wage shortage is going to play out,"With most discussions on and off the internet you tend to see two sides to the issue; those that call it a worker/labor shortage and those that say its a wage shortage. 

But there's also a undercurrent of ""this is just because of COVID"". And I think thats going to end up being the takeaway when this issue desseminates, especially if it ends up not going in the workers favor which it likely wont for most.

And when its discussed, it wont be ""acceptable"" to say it was about people not being paid enough, itll be because COVID was scary, and we need to stop imposing socialism on people who were just scared to leave their homes. 

Its not too dissimilar to what happened with Sanders, where still people pretend there wasnt a massive media shitshow aimed against him or that somebody like Clyburn effectively controlling nearly half the vote in South Carolina isnt a bad thing, and that these things cant unjustly influence how a voter votes, no, its just because he wasnt popular. 

Sanders had a lot of issues he could (and should have) fixed to do better than he did, just as theres truth to the idea that COVID is a big factor in why people arent working, but to deny the other aspects out of ideological spite is just gross. 

But its most likely what will happen. Mark my words, go on r/politics in a few months to a year, and look at what interpretations of this are acceptable.

1168,Yeah... I'm stressed.,"23M, living in the great, free USA.

 
I've been living off of and slowly draining my college funds, living in a tiny studio apartment with a roommate. I haven't had a job since October because I can't keep up with the grind, and not to mention covid's a thing... I can't deal with the lack of appreciation. For whatever reason, I feel that living in a state of constant anxiety over dwindling funds and looming eviction is a better option than working an unfulfilling job to further a company's profits only to receive a sliver of the worth of my labor.

I can probably make it another couple of months with what I have left in savings. I have no idea what I'm going to do after my funds dry up. I'm at a loss. WHY can't I just force myself to work, even part time, to keep myself afloat? At least for the time being until I can figure out what to do next? I'm making my life so difficult for myself. I can not explain this extreme opposition I have to reentering the job market. It's kinda bumming me out. I think part of it is being afraid that what I do doesn't matter. No matter how much effort I put in, it doesn't matter. It's extremely emotionally taxing to work a job that you hate, yet you put in your all, and get hardly anything out of it relative to what you put in. It burns you. You don't see the point of it anymore.

I don't think I'm lazy... Maybe I am, I don't know. I just feel confined. It feels wrong to do anything that I like that's not conventionally productive because I'm not being ""a productive member of society"" in the typical sense so I sit alone at home with crippling depression and anxiety. With that considered, I don't do a whole lot with my time but I would like to do more. I like to tinker with shit and fix things. It's what I do with the free time that I've had, if I'm not busy drowning in myself. I could be using the time to better my mental health (and I have, and do put in effort) but it's hard to keep up with the demands of a healthy psyche when I'm buried in constant stress over financial necessities. Professional mental help is on the agenda.

I can't help but feel that it's entirely my fault. I do take responsibility for the position I've put myself in but I'm so pissed off with the system that we've allowed to come into existence. We're expected to be a cog in the machine of infinite capital gain, yet we are unseen. These companies would be NOTHING without their workers and I can't bring myself to work for a hierarchy that is incapable of acknowledging this fact. But I suppose they don't need to acknowledge this fact because of... Idk, wage slavery..? Fuck, I love this country.

Am I just an entitled piece of shit who thinks the world owes me everything? Possibly, but I don't see it that way. I just want to be able to survive with the basic necessities to stay alive (food, water, shelter, etc.) while I can figure my shit out. We should NOT be forced into the labor market if only to take care of our natural autonomous human needs.

I genuinely don't know what to do. I have no ambition. Why am I being punished for that? Why am I being punished because I'm in a kind of existential paralysis that I can't seem to navigate? How do I get past this anger? I've dug myself into a mental hole and I don't know how to climb out. I'm so sick of being angry. Am I in the wrong? Am I delusional? What is it that I'm missing???

Do I need to give in? Do I need to say ""yeah, this is the world we live in, I just need to suck it up and shut up. Keep your head down, eyes down, forget everything you know. Forget your morals. Forget who you are."" How? I seem to be incapable of seeing conformity to the capital machine as an option. What other option do I have..? I don't see an out. I feel so trapped. I'm scared. I'm scared for myself and for all of us who are struggling.

 I can't forget the things that I've learned about this system we live in. I can't forget the exploitation. I can't forget the lives of people who are working themselves to death and giving up their livelihood just to support themselves and their families. I can't forget the millions of people who go bankrupt just by keeping themselves alive only to receive crippling medical debt. I can't forget the millions of dollars worth of unsold food and materials being destroyed to create false scarcity when there are millions living in poverty and living paycheck to paycheck who could easily benefit from these trashed items. I can't forget the fact that there are over half a million homeless people when there are forty times as many empty houses than homeless in this nation. I can't forget the ultra wealthy hording hundreds of billions in wealth, laughing, while the common person struggles to live a happy, fulfilling, stress free life. I can't forget this increasing class divide. And I can't forgive.

We're killing this planet. The only home we have. The home of an unfathomable number of diverse living beings. All for infinite gain in a world of finite resources. Capitalism only focuses on short term gain while willfully ignoring long term consequences. I don't want to be apart of that. Most have been so conditioned into a hyper individualistic view that we've lost our sense of community. We've forgotten that we are a collective being. We've forgotten how to tap into the life force that we all share. We've made it near impossible to find individual and collective happiness. For what..?

I'm sad that more people aren't as pissed off that we're allowing this to continue, though I think I see a shift happening, especially in my generation. We need to keep the momentum. However, this could just be conformation bias on my part. I'm tired of complaining and being angry. I want to change this society for the better, for all of us. I just don't know how to do that. I need to relinquish control and come to terms with the fact that I can't. Not as an individual. We are way overdue for a radical shift. I just hope it happens within our lifetime. I hope we can come together to end this unnecessary suffering. 

I'm sorry for ranting but I can't keep these feelings contained, it's killing me. I can't talk about these issues with the people in my life because they see people in need as less than and see people who are on government assistance as lazy leeches on society. Idk...

Let me know what your thoughts are. Am I lazy dog shit for holding these views? Or am I part of a larger common group than I imagine? I'm genuinely curious. If anyone has been or is in a similar situation, how do you manage around this?

1179,Come in on your day off?,"To preface, I'm an automotive tech at a dealership. I had a newer vehicle come in with electrical issues that ended up needing further repairs after the initial fix. A wiring harness that would have required the entire interior of the truck stripped and replaced.

I ordered the part overnight on Monday. Since Tuesday, I was working on another techs ""comeback"" because of what management assumed was an issue with a recall repair. I found nothing wrong with the recall repair done, yet spent hours working on the car to appease management. 

On my way home last night (4 day week, 10hr days), about to start my 3 day weekend and do the assignments for school I had pushed off until I had the time to focus, I get a call from my service advisors phone. Ended up being one of my managers, and the call basically went like this.

MG: Hey, can you come in tomorrow and do that wiring harness?

Me: Can't. I've got a ton of school work to do.

MG (under his breath): Schoolwork. Yeah.

Me: Yes. I have 4 assignments due this weekend. I need all three days off to complete them. So no, I can't come in.

MG: Well if the truck isn't fixed, we're going to have to buy it back.

Me: Sorry, no can do. I'll be in on Monday.

The audacity to have me run around on another techs car, than try calling me in to do a repair I could have started Tuesday when I still had the rest of the week, is astounding. Just a complete disregard for people having their own lives outside of work. Fortunately I've been through this enough to know they can't do anything about scheduled days off. My time is for me, and I give enough of my time and life to this company.

1196,The lies they tell you,"So this is just venting. This is kind of overly personal and has more to do with people's sociopathic tendencies when it comes to work. This isn't about rhetoric or tactics, just something I remember. There's this black hole of empathy when it comes to jobs, not just from your managers but from your peers, family, and really just everyone. I'm not sure what causes it, maybe that's just how humans react to what they see as necessary evils. 

When I was a teenager I was scared to work. I've always had extreme anxiety about situations I can't imagine. Something as simple as moving the TV to another room would see me in bed for a week, and I didn't even like TV. I've since learned to deal, but that anxiety still mixes with negativity and will just fuck me up. It's probably not anything I'll ever be able to articulate. But as a teen I had this idea about work that I was assured was made up non-sense; I thought no job would want me if I couldn't pull massive amounts of overtime. 

I learned that from my dad's job. Of course that's not an entirely compete thought. I knew places like dollar general and McDonalds ran on part time work, but I also knew those wouldn't ever be good enough for anything. I wasn't the type to attract a bread winner, the government would never help a single young man pay his bills, I was on my own. 

I can not tell you how many separate people I tried to express this anxiety to. My parents told me I was making stuff up and I should accept I didn't know what I was talking about. My friends talked about their grocery store jobs where they made minimal wage 20 hours a week. My siblings, who married bread winners, told me I didn't have anything to worry about. 

I've flailed for years trying to find a ""Good fit."" I've worked dozens of jobs, each one absolutely miserable. My entire adult life has been a blurr of pain and exhaustion. And finally, after paying my own fucking money to get certified and pulling on the only connection I ever managed to get, I got a production control job at a metal stamping company. It was easy, I was on my ass all day, and they worked a bit of overtime but only about 8 extra hours a month. I could handle that. For the litteral first time in my entire life, I was making money at a job that didn't send me home in pain. 

Well, I got fired. And here I am, looking for another forklift job. Hopefully production control. But it's this funny thing, every single company around me wants you to work about 60-70 hours a week. 

I've never really gotten over the fact that I predicted a massive issue in my life at like 13 and everyone gaslit me over it. So do I go work at McDonalds or any of the other dozens of fast food joints for no benefits and a random ass patchwork schedule, or do i work at any of the dozens of production/warehouse jobs where I'll hopefully be able to sit for the majority of the time but work 6-7 days a week, 10 hours a day?

1200,A WW2 bomb was found near my workplace but the managers kept us operating until the last possible hour.,"I'm just kinda stunned right now. The bomb wasn't planted or anything, it was a relic of WW2 that had been discovered nearby so idk how at risk we actually were, but it feels pretty shit that my employer prioritised their profit margin over the employees - and meanwhile the business owners and managers are all off work atm, either self-isolating after a covid risk or on holiday. Tucked away safely.

When they did finally close, they still had us clean up and prepare everything for the next day before leaving. I mean, we were paid for our time and I guess that did need doing but that's not the point. I feel like it should've been done way sooner. Nearby businesses had already started to close up, as early as 7 hours before we did apparently.

1219,Do I work with idiots or is there some greater rationale that’s over my head?,"Asking for some advice about a ridiculous process at work that has not been fixed

Especially this problem is very simple to fix, yet it won’t get fixed. I monitor an email account at work that gets both regular domestic orders and special, time sensitive, expensive orders that need to be sent to a purchaser who placed the orders. The amount of special orders has increased a lot and within the last year I’ve passed along these orders to this person. This past week I found one that I missed and was two-3 weeks late. Not terribly bad because of the supply chain issues globally. 

The problem I have is that this company wants 0 mistakes, and mistakes have happened before when someone left and I’m not sure if it was my fault or theirs as they monitored the account more than I did at the time. 

Missing one out of 200 orders is still 99% correct and without mistakes. However, I’d like to mitigate almost any chance this has by just telling the company that orders from us to copy the person who places the special orders in the first place?

Sounds like the most simple and effective way to make sure nothing gets missed right? Instead of it replying on me 100%. Not that I can’t do it, but on a long enough timeline a human error is bound to happen. So yeah, I might miss one along the way and forget to forward it to them like what happened this last week. 

I tried mentioning this solution a year ago and it wasn’t even acknowledged. 

Am I being unreasonable in thinking these people I work with are crazy for not just telling our partner CC the special orders to the correct person as well? Should i just do it? 

Should I not care if the person these orders are meant to go to gets mad or I get In Trouble because it’s crazy not to do this?

The only reason I can imagine they don’t want to get Cced is because they’re afraid they’ll miss it and be responsible? But what’s the difference who sends it to them? Other special orders already get send to them from another company.

I'm so burnt out and every day I just wanna clock out and disappear.

I always feel so ungrateful for hating my job. Between the benefits and pay, as well as being able to work from home. I still feel awful about it even though I'm yelled at and bullied by customers every day. It just takes one bad interaction to completely mess up my day. 

I have a degree in Media Studies which I was lucky to get through a federal pell grant. I wasn't thinking about being 30 when I chose my major, just like I wasn't thinking about even making it to graduation in high school. I just had a genuine interest for film theory. Mind you, these grants were for folks living at or below the poverty line during the Obama years. I had no business studying that. 

I have 0 career prospects now. It's as useful as a high school diploma. I was homeless for about a year in college because of my mental health. I thought that once I got out of college I'd be employable. Wrong!

What they don't tell you is how in a lot of industries you need to know someone or be well connected to find a job. Every single job I've ever had, I've had to know someone to get somewhere. I grew up with no connections and parents who didn't set me up for success (which I don't resent them for, they're human). I can never get by based on my own merit. 

I've even tried changing my last name on job applications to a more white sounding name and was emailed offers for interviews. It just sucks that there's nothing about me being myself that's employable to companies. 

**I would rather just not work, period. But that's not a choice.** I'm missing out on so much in life because my life revolves around my worth as far as a job. I am not mentally cut out for a lot of this shit, even though I have a psych and therapist. I feel like an absolute fucking failure. This country treats people with disabilities like shit. Treats women like shit. Treats everyone like shit, as far as I'm concerned.

1245,"My job can't find anyone to work, and still harasses and nitpicks the people who still show up everyday. (long read)","I work in a manufacturing setting, specifically for food. Which means yes, I did work through the entire pandemic because we were deemed ""essential"".

We work 10.5 hours shifts 5-6 days a week.I hit 40 hours before Thursday is even over...... At this point all of the people who are still working in my department are pretty much veterans, we've all been here for at least a few years. Most of us all come in everyday, we are never late. We always get our jobs done to the best of our abilities. I myself have not been late a single time in over 2 years, and almost never miss days. 

We have gotten to the point where we are all so familiar and experienced the the production process that we almost never have significant downtime or ever cause food production to halt. This means the entire time we are there 99.99% of the time product is consistently being produced without a single major problem. But since the production side of the factory can't find any employees who want to work in a 104 degree kitchen 10.5 hours a day (if you think Frito-Lay is a lone in this struggle, welcome to every major factory in America), they can't produce as much product as past years. So they seem to take it out on us, even though we've all been here religiously the entire pandemic. 

Despite how efficient we've all become all they ever want to do is drag us to the same meeting over and over again, about how our breaks are too long, how we are on our phones too much, how a ""higher up"" saw us in a group talking towards the end of the shift. How we are here to do a job, and get paid, and not goof off. Despite the fact we are doing our jobs, almost as perfectly as we can, we've gotten our system down so we'll it's what allows us to have any leisure at all. We operate and maintain AUTOMATED MACHINERY. If you have the setup and settings dialed in correctly you could go an entire day or more without a single issue, and since we've all been here so long, we've gotten good at it, we've essentially eliminated major downtime in our department. So what they see is a bunch of people doing nothing, when the reality is, we've worked to get production to the consistency it is now, and we come in to maintain that level of quality so we can have the lowest stress day possible. 

So they see us on our phones, or maybe taking a slightly extended break. Considering we are only given one measly 30 minute break for a 10.5 hour shift. It never feels like enough, almost no one in the entire company follows this policy because it's bullshit. 

We are all burnt out, drained, tired of the bullshit from the higher ups. Even our direct supervisors and managers are just messengers at this point who are tired of it too. They are taking their reduced profits due to lack of workers on all of us. And it's driving everyone insane, and further making people want to leave. They are creating their own problem themselves, not ""government handouts"". Turns out no one wants to be a slave for an asshole company. 

Anyways. I told my boss, I want a $2.50/hr raise or I'm quitting immediately.  They basically have no power right now, and I'm fortunate I'm in a position only one other person does. If they don't give it to me, then I'm having some self respect and leaving. I'm tired of working 60+ hours a week for a company that doesn't give a fuck about all the things we've done to get it running as smooth as it does.

1258,Work system review and how we CAN change it for US ALL,"I think, to analyse, we need to go back to the start, fair basic trade. Where you got to trade items of personal value for things of others personal value. This obviously worked I'd say currency became a global form of value, but obviously, it's universally valued, not personally valued. So this creates a sense of worthlessness to itself, hence why it's so easy to get rid of. Hence why it's easier to binge with money than personal items. I'm putting money on governments knowing this. Now, this slowly became a problem because people just threw money everywhere. Most rich people see money as super valuable or super worthless, they are one in the same dependant on circumstance, hence it being a system that creates many issues. When the value of money is purely dependant on demand, such as stocks are, they become volatile. Money creates it's own system within it's system, either you invest and maybe make millions or go poor, so even their stocks are gambling which still feeds the corporations and they wanna call it a ""FREE MARKET"". Hold up, what? You have to have money in order to make money back in stocks meaning the poor and rich becomes more devised within it's own system. Besides this corruption, there's TONS more. A great example is when the great Reddit GameStop Market crash occurred and one of the Reddit boards made GameStop rise and crash just because of some big corpo fucks wanted to take a hold of it. AND THEN SOME APPS HAD THE AUDACITY TO STOP PEOPLE DOING WHAT THEY WHERE COMPLETELY ALLOWED TO DO. WHICH IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL. RIGHT UNDER OUR FUCKING NOSES. It's a complete fucking joke, and I'm sick of hearing this free market bullshit. 

Besides that, work has become ""just a part of life"". Which I personally think is the most disgusting way to ""progress"" as a society. Because guess what, we aren't developing as a society, we're developing as a government. Just like Japan needs more people for their ageing workforce, their government creates apps for them to date and have sex, so they can endlessly fuel the bottomless pit of human flesh they need for their growing pyramid scheme. It's gonna be the same for everyone else too. Hell, I'd say the meme-ish analogy of the pyramid scheme of society is wrong too. It's not (from bottom to top), Military, society, government, elites. It's actually, Society, Military, Government, Elites. The more INSANE part is, you have ONE life to enjoy, and you're being paid barely enough to live and as low as possible for LITERALLY WASTING YOUR LIFE. THIS IS DISGUSTING, and half the time it doesn't even fucking show for itself. And N0BODY DOES ANYTHING AGAINST THIS. Personally, I'd arrange a WORLDWIDE strike. Not set by some fucking Union. Do it yourself, do it fast, and do it with crushing force. Just like a bad relationship, which is what we have with work, all of us. Set boundaries that WILL NOT be broken, and pay AS WE DEMAND OR NOTHING. Because I can guarantee, the corps will shit themselves the seconds it happens and will be on their fucking knees. We would have to become one strong unit, whether it be harbouring the homeless and helpless folk or not, I would fucking do it. Horde items and manage the resources equally, what you trade is what you keep as valued and you would need for 2 weeks of survival max 1 week minimum. If we never do we it they will never change.

I personally, will be spraying my local town with HUGE ANTI-WORK signs which hopefully should boost everyone's morale here, I keep my promises and I WILL deliver. However, why doesn't everyone else fucking do it here too. Just write ABOLISH WORK or ANTI WORK anywhere except houses, cars and windows, that's a dick move.

1287,My employer was screwing me out of overtime pay so I reported it and got it back and then some. Figured you all might like this story.,"This company, I'll call A contacted my school during my last semester. They were looking for the best student the school had and that just happened to be me. It was at a community college and I had some university experience so I was killing it there (4.0 GPA)

A wanted me to do an internship which was fine but it wasn't an internship at all. It was just unpaid work. I had to teach myself things. That was annoying and lasted a month. At the time, I really needed a job so I took it. After the internship, I thought they would hire me but apparently they didn't trust me enough yet so they switched me to an independent contractor. This is problematic because it means I have to pay more in taxes and I have to pretty much lie on my tax return because I don't own a business. That lasted 4 months. I needed the money so I kept my mouth shut.

After 4 months, they hired me as a regular employee even though my job duties didn't change from intern, to independent contractor, to employee. Meaning I should have been an employee the whole time.

I thought I was in the clear. The pay was decent for my area so I figured I'd let it all slide, sweep it under the rug. But then about 4 months later, they decided they didn't like the IT administrator so they wanted me to start learning his job. The problem is they wanted me to stay 2 hours over each day and have him train me but I had to clock out and into another company they owned that was in the same building that I'll call B. So I was clocking into to B but still working for A so they could avoid paying me overtime. Of course, that's not how it works. I can't create 2 companies and work an employee 80 between both of them and not have to pay them overtime. It's even worst because I wasn't working for B at all. If this happens to you, it's called joint employment.

I wasn't hurting for money too much at this time, so I said, ""Fuck it, I'm not going to say anything and let it build up and then slam them with a complaint down the line."" Maybe if they were nice I would have been nice back but my boss is rude and manages via intimidation and fear. So of course, she has to pay the asshole tax.

In the end, it didn't work out exactly as I'd hope but it wasn't too bad either. I told a coworker and she got scared that I was going to mention her name when I complained. No idea why she'd think that. I'd never drag her into it but whatever. So they found out about it from her and within 3 weeks my desk was moved making my job more difficult, my overtime hours were stopped, one of my breaks was taken away (and then given back the next day after she talked with her lawyer lol), I furloughed for 90 days—during which someone else got hired to replace my position—and finally then I got a letter saying my position was eliminated altogether even though it wasn't. They claimed I was furloughed and the position was eliminated because of economic hardship due to covid-19 but they had hired another person about a month before I was furloughed, hired my replacement during my furlough, and had their leaky roof fixed which cost about 2 million according to my friend who still works there (probably not accurate though). I'm not buying their reasoning and hopefully a judge won't either.

After I got the letter, I submitted a complaint to the Department of Labor. They investigated the whole company and looked into all the employees. Turns out, they were screwing over a lot of their employees. About 15 people got between 300 and 600 dollars. I was rewarded about 2000 plus another 2000 for punitive damages. They flushed 1300 down the drain training me. It has already cost them but they aren't out of the woods yet.

I've also submitted two complaints to the IRS for when they misclassified me. They haven't made a judgement on that yet but they said it does appear to be the case that I was misclassified.

And finally, I submitted a claim for retaliation. I wasn't expecting them to do that but once I noticed they were, I started documenting everything I could. My boss making me move my desk near hers was the dumbest decision she could have made. She thought I didn't know what was going on but HR told IT and I'm friends with IT so he told me. I started documenting everything and while pretending I didn't know anything. I probably could have said something which was what I had originally planned but I have a lot of anxiety.

I'll update you guys on the IRS ruling and the retaliation complaint as soon as I hear something.

What's sad is that I gave these people my all and they just screwed me every chance they got. I worked there for 18 months. I missed 1 hour of work because my phone died in the middle of the night. I was really good at my job, my fellow coworkers liked me. You couldn't have asked for a better employee but they went out of their way to take advantage of me.

I just don't get it. Like, bitch, I'm on YOUR TEAM. I'm busting my ass to make YOU richer and instead of being nice and delighted you, fuck me over? What the fuck is wrong with you?

This isn't the first time they've been caught doing something like this. A few years ago, they got caught  by imports/customs for claiming some goods they were shipping was only 10,000 dollars when it was worth 100,000 dollars to avoid paying so much tax on it. They were fined over 911,000 dollars + 250,000 in lawyer fees.

1289,I got suspended today!,"Lurker. New.

Yeah.

I work at a funeral home, doing body recovery and helping with funeral services. Not a bad gig! But we had FOUR funerals scheduled from 8 to 5, which, you might guess, is exhausting for us suit-wearing peons. Two funerals is typically the max for a single day; three is crazy.

Four is just unheard of.

It’s hot right now in the southern U.S., and I was working our morning service at a graveside. No shade to hide in or anything, just standing there saturating my nice clothes for an hour in the sun, with more funerals to work afterward. After the service was over, we started to tear down the casket lowering equipment, tent, chairs, all that, which tends to be dusty, dirty work.

I took my clean white button-down overshirt off to do all that, after the family was gone and there were a couple hangers-on shooting the shit with nowhere else to be. So I worked in my T shirt and got dressed again after it was done.

THAT was what I got suspended over. I haven’t been working there long and I guess i’m still pretty much “training” after my first month. I didn’t know that what I was doing was wrong.

That afternoon they called me into the office and woof, suspended me on the spot. This is just one week after one of our people cussed another out in a facebook rant unprovoked, with no penalty.

That suspension happened so fucking fast it blew my goddamn hair back. I have NEVER received disciplinary action at a job. The other workers there called me tonight and said they were gonna raise hell about it tomorrow morning. I swear i thought i was doing well at this job. I’ve never felt more expendable.

1311,Workaholism vs Food Addiction vs Alcoholism,"Food addiction is one of the hardest addictions to overcome because we are forced to eat every day. Food exposure is a gateway to food addiction. Many dont develop eating disorders, especially those who understand nutrition, but many do. Alcoholism is less common than food addition, you are never forced to drink alcohol, your vectors of exposure are less. And you can quit 'cold turkey' with fewer consequences. Once the withdrawal is over you you never need to drink again.   


Now contrast workaholism. Many dont become addicted to work, especially those who understand economics, but some do. And like food addiction most of us cannot go 'cold turkey' if your relationship with work become obsessive and unhealthy. And most of us are forced to work from a very early age.   


When treating addiction we must ask 'what need does the addiction fulfill for the addict? what void are they filling in their lives?' and when we examine workaholism from this perspective i think we can easily see why its so common for people to work themselves to death, work unpaid overtime, show up early and leave late, dedicate their whole lives to work. They're filling a void in their lives, ironically this void is often caused by 40 hour work-weeks. just like food addiction is often caused by being forced to eat every day to live.   


To combat workaholism we need to show workaholics that they can fulfill their needs for social interaction and validation outside of the office. We need to show them that working is actually stopping them from achieving their true personal goals.   


Making capitalists richer shouldnt be the sole focus of your life. It does nothing to fulfill you spiritually or emotionally, it does virtually nothing to enrich your community or family. Those area healthy and productive things to dedicate your life to, things which give back, not a job which sucks your life out and then throws you to the curb.

1321,looking for a subreddit for what Im feelinh,"Hi all,

I'm trying to find a sub that deals with what I'm dealing with now. I hate working for people, being subservient to them, having to deal with bullshit just to have the privilege of living. I've been a job hopper. Done some seasonal work and other temporary type jobs hostels etc. I know people look down on me for this and others pity me which might be even worse. It's like I'm a failure or a loser because I don't want to conform and kiss ass and be in some fake environment. It might sound childish to some people like I'm an angsty teenager but I'm turning 34 in 3 weeks and this is still how I feel. Part of me is angry that people are like this and also I think I shouldn't care but it bugs me.

 Also, the expectation that I should get married have kids. Those are the big three you're supposed to have in your thirties marriage, kids and career and I have none of that. But I also want none of those things! A good relationship would be nice but I also feel like I have given up my independence in relationships in the past and feel like I'm at my best when unattached. 

I just want to make cool things, enjoy music and cuddle my cat. I see people I know who have lived nonconformist lives expressing so much shame. Really just shame POURING out of them for how they've lived their lives. Shame at not being who they think they are supposed to be/doing what they should be doing. And when I hear this stuff it makes me feel awful because it's like I thought we were on the same page but I guess we're not and it makes me feel like I should be living my life differently and I start taking on their shame.

I think part of my problem is that I want to live my life the way I want but I still want that stamp of approval and the two are incongruent. I have these two opposing feelings intense people-pleasing and also fuck you and your shitty opinions on how I should live my life. They don't really go together. 

Anyways, I'm trying to find a subreddit that is appropriate for this. I came here because well this is a glorious witches pot of nonconformity but there are certain aspects that I want to discuss that aren't here. So I'm wanting to find a sub that takes on all these ideas.",False,op637d,Bigbootybanjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/op637d/looking_for_a_subreddit_for_what_im_feelinh/,1,1

1323,Don't get me wrong...,"I enjoy working it gives me something to do. What I dislike strongly ( my opinion and speaking from experience ) is this...allow me.

I've had and held numerous jobs (I'm 34)  some enjoyable and some not. When covid came I took a massive pay cut and got into a brand new career and trade because well nothing is free. I was employed with this place for about 15 months. Finally in my 34 years of life I was able to have a company provide me with health insurance ( not that I'm hardly ever sick ) and a 401k after a year. 

Now during this process and keep in mind that I took a massive pay cut I ultimately picked up a second job delivering for a really cool pizza shop by my house. The hours seemed to work and didn't really conflict with my day job. Along the way I took meticulous notes of miles driven hourly wage and tips at my second job.

After burning the candle at both ends with working from 7am till about 10 11pm between the two jobs I got burnt out. I called my day time employer and said that I'm not gonna be coming in and I don't feel well ( really it's none of their business ) I was met with a text saying "" don't return to work unless you have a doctor's note. 

Remember me stating that they provided insurance...well this insurance has a $3000 deductible which I haven't met because well I hardly ever get sick. I called a ""docNAbox"" and was told $150 to be seen. Now I really didn't need to be seen because there is nothing wrong with me except for occasionally being lazy and I sure as shit wasn't gonna pay $150.

Now here we are today. I opened up some mail and it's my insurance and 401k information. I noticed, to keep my insurance ( no body is insured but me...no kids no wife...just me ) and that $3000 deductible, it was $515 a month...500 a month. 

There is no moral of this story there is no good need and no bad news...just FUCK!!! This is so retarded ( no offense to any who suffered from that or knows someone.

1325,"I'm in upper management at a fortune 500 company, and I want to do better.","I manage a large software development department.

I try to do the best I can for the people in my department, though some things are out of my control.

I would love ideas on what else I can do to help make people less miserable. I am also willing to answer questions about why some things are the way they are.

I do try now... like I approve all remote work requests, if I see someone scheduling a meeting at lunch I ask them to move it, I try to do what I can for people salary-wise (though that is 95% out of my control), I don't ask anyone for reasons for take time off, nobody has to justify time they earned... well I'm not trying to virtue signal here but just give a few examples so that is enough of that.

I sometimes fail though. Due to policies, regulations, audit findings, etc... there is a lot of bureaucracy that gets put on top of what we do. I hate that some people in my dept. have to spend time writing up documentation that will honestly never be referenced. But conversations with senior leaders have led nowhere. Senior leaders also frequently shift our outsourcing strategy. Sometimes people we've worked with for years are suddenly too risky or expensive to work for us any more, and despite the trust and friendships we have built up... I have to tell people their contract will not be renewed. There have been cases in the past where I've been forced to rate employees below what I think they are performing, just so the company can make financial targets for pay increases. I have argued against this practice, but at the end of the day have not convinced anyone this is unfair.

1343,All-consuming,"I watched a video the other day from Cheshire police in the uk that was trying to warn people about their aggressive driving, it had a good idea it didn't really use properly. It would show the beginning of a driving clip then freeze, circle a car and say something like; 'Thomas Smith, a vet who likes badminton'. Then it'd jump to another clip and freeze etc. I expected it to unfreeze each clip and show how otherwise seemingly well adjusted normal people can  be capable of dangerous driving. 

When i went on a speed awareness course they didn't teach us anything about driving laws, it was all about psychology, trying to get us to imagine the person behind the wheel of the other vehicle, their history, their life.

I don’t get road rage at all, i mean i personally never get angry while driving not that i don't understand why some do. I mostly get angry about having to constantly stop for red lights. Venting fury at lights instead of other road users, what an improvement.

I sometimes think i place too much emphasise on the effect ubi would have, in terms of relieving financial pressures and insecurity. It doesn't change lack of flexibility at work and all the pressures that come with it. It doesn't change the work commute or traffic or working hours. 

Everything that comes up i think about ubi. That domestic violence increases when England lose, that Onlyfans has become so popular with students and nurses needing to do it to get by. That we're so far gone that everyone might as well shrug about the creepy relationship a person carves out with hundreds of strangers with enough disposable income to pay for boob videos. It's really sad and i don't blame people at all. It's the constant hilarity of there being money out there in the world, just..many don’t have significant chunks to get by. 

(I realise ubi has its critics who are in favour of universal basic services, but always by ubi i don’t mean the implementation but the essence of eliminating the need to earn to live - i want free housing but we're nowhere near that). 

There was a young woman on This Morning from a Eastern European country who wanted to sell her virginity to fund her university fees and the presenters spent the whole interview trying to persuade to not do it. The moralising directed at people who had no say whatsoever in the social and economic environment they were brought up in and who gave already reckoned with how things are. Those at the top can be cold and ruthless when it comes to business but those at the bottom must slave for a million hours to get ahead and not dare try to be smart about making quick leaps. 

This is a bit long and rambling, do i place too much importance on work's all consuming effect on people in terms of anger, drug abuse, domestic abuse, racism, i wouldn't want to dismiss misogyny in society and tribalism and ignorance. 

But just whenever i hear about a parent who abandoned their children i think about the trap of parenting, it's not just a beautiful time of building a precious relationship but long hours to get by. There are some who just don't feel anything and many who having children warms their heart and gives them the energy to work in the never ending grind because they live for the joy of their family. And i know if i said any of this to anyone in real life they'd think 'warms their heart, really?' and just look blankly like 'yeah, and? That's how it is?' The ideology of work in terms of stressing so much on to the individual rather than sharing the load, whether with other employees or computers or machines is so baffling to me when the aim is meant to be productivity. And how that's embraced by people who feel unfulfilled if they don’t do a hard days work and earn their end of day rest. 

By bringing stuff up to people they roll their eyes and think; oh here we go again, but the point is to say; you know this will never change unless it's brought up right? But they know that, they're just long past the point of highlighting it and talking about something it hurts to engage in how futile it feels for them.

First of all, it occured to me that companies looking at the prices of food and rent and other necessities and then paying employees just enough so that they can basically never leave and have to work however many hours of their life to afford these necessities seems like a form of monopoly on the employees. 

The employee’s time and labor is all taken up by one company, many times making it impossible to move up one’s career or to quit. 

And in that sense it is not only a monopoly but also a form of regulated slavery. Now maybe slavery is not the correct term to use, but regardless this is a severe power imbalance and likely a violation of human rights.

And secondly, didn’t this form of employemnt arise during the industrial revolution? A time when slavery was still a thing or at least only starting to become illegal?


So… this type of employment… is likely based on slavery…

1350,Finally quit my cushy Wall Street job," 

Hey r/antiwork

I recently quit my cushy finance job to start working for myself/my own startup!

If you're on the fence about quitting your 9-5, you may find my decision-making framework helpful.

Here's a breakdown detailing:

1. Details about my previous job
2. My thought process in deciding to quit

Let's get into it!

&amp;#x200B;

# About the Job

* Financial analyst and globally recognized bank
* Rotational program feeding AVP (Associate Vice President) positions
* $80K total comp: $70K base pay w/$10K signing/relocation bonus
* Incredible, comprehensive benefits
* First job out of college

&amp;#x200B;

# Factors in Decision to Quit

1. Passions
2. Skillset
3. Support
4. Financials

&amp;#x200B;

**Passions**

I went to school for Hotel Administration - essentially a business degree through the lens of hospitality. I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to serve others.

As I progressed through college, banking/consulting grew wildly popular with my peers.

I was in the top of my class, excelling in finance, accounting, and real estate classes.

Banks were trendy. They were socially accepted. They paid well and had great benefits. I was able to convince myself that financial analysis was something I enjoyed.

It's not.

I've spoken with representatives of various other disciplines within finance. It's not just the team I was on - no matter how hard I tried, I could not get excited about corporate finance. It just wasn't for me.

Meanwhile, I found myself thinking about my startup whenever I had the time. I thought about it in the shower. I thought about it before going to sleep at night. I started zoning out of meetings at work to think about it.

I started sneaking in work at my startup whenever I got the chance. People from around the world were reaching out to me, asking me when I was going to launch.

The more I thought about it, the more it became clear that corporate finance was not the place for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Skillset**

When I examined the skills I consider to be my ""superpowers"" - the ones I am exceptionally good at, the ones that set me apart from others - they didn't align with corporate finance.

These skills include:

* Writing
* Creativity
* Visual Art/Design
* Empathy

I realized that if I spent the next 5 years of my life creating financial projections, I would become exceedingly good at creating financial projections while becoming less good at other things.

I didn't want to lose my superpowers. That prospect terrified me.

Instead, I wanted to do something that would allow me to leverage my superpowers to the greatest extent possible. Doing so would allow me to create the most value.

And in my case, my superpowers did not align with the job I was in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Support**

Coming from a background of excessive overachievement, I deeply wanted the support of my parents in order to feel good about this decision. I know how hard they worked to put me into a great school, and I recognized that they felt my finance job was successful and secure.

When I told them about my desire to quit my job in favor of working for myself, they were concerned.

As parents, they wanted me to be safe and to have a successful future. But they also wanted me to be able to reach my full potential.

When I explained that my skills were being underutilized, that I felt stifled, they understood that my job was not the best fit for me.

After I explained my thought process and my plans, they even offered to let me stay with them while I figured things out.

This was huge.

**Financials**

No matter how much you want to leave a job, you can't do so if you can't afford to live without your income.

I have around $30K total right now. Most of it is invested in stocks and crypto, but it's liquid enough to take out if needed.

But by leaving my job within a year from starting, I would need to return the $10K signing/relocation bonus I received.

This would leave me with $20K.

Budgeting:

$157/mo for my student loan payment

$36/mo for various subscriptions

$57/mo for other expenses

$300/mo for food

$900/mo for rent

This would leave me with $1450/mo of expenses, or $17,400/yr.

I wanted to give myself 1 full year to see if I could make it on my own. If I drained my bank account, I would still be left with $2,600.

It would be cutting it close, but I was resolved to make the investment in myself, to give myself and my startup a chance.

When my parents came in with the absolutely gift of letting me stay with them rent-free, it strengthened my resolve to take the leap.

1353,Walked out of job,"I'm 21 (M) uni student. I walked out of a supermarket operations job mid way through shift. Was being treated like crap by a manager and her blatant lies. Got of it. The final straw was when I asked when my temp contract was up and if I was being kept on. Was told later by the toxic manager that I was being let go in a week and I wasn't fit for the job (made a mistake or two in the first week) - and there's no hours left for me, which is funny because people were for for holidays and staff left to go elsewhere.

My friend still works there full time and he's saying that they are now understaffed and put up an advert 3 weeks ago and haven't employed anyone, he says they're being more picky about selections now because I walked out mid shift, either that, or nobody is applying

I mean it was good timing as there's now a heatwave here (30 degrees, which is hot for Ireland) and doing the simple things I appreciate more.

They tried to ring me and I didn't answer, they rang my next of kin and asked if I 'was ok' and they wanted the uniform back (well I through it out lol)

I normally wouldn't walk out on a job but the toxicity and lack of professional management was laughable

Basically they were selling me an engineering internship, when all I got was a soul-sucking data entry job with a desk right in front of my manager's. I left after 2 months.

Staffing agencies exist to work with businesses to screw over their employees. Less pay, no benefits, and never any room to grow because the business you're hired at will never officially hire you as an employee, and will lie through their teeth to make you think otherwise. Staffing agencies are not unions, they will not protect you because you are easily replaceable for all the awful jobs they have. Their existence should be completely illegal as they prevent non-aware employees from getting the benefits they need.

1370,I can't refinance without a job,"So I decided to become self employed 6 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My income isn't great ATM, but I have a ton of savings and am living frugal so I'm doing alright.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw how interest rates have dropped a ton so I decided to jump on that as it'd lower my costs by several hundred dollars a month... but they won't let me refinance because I don't have a job. To refinance if you're self employed everyone is telling me I need TWO YEARS of tax returns.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the kicker... the one bank already has my loan. I don't understand if they already own my loan why they won't refinance. It logically makes no sense and is so frustrating. Since they already own my loan why does it matter? Wouldn't it lower their risk if I get a lower interest rate? Like... if I had a normal job they'd lower my interest rate by 2%, but because I don't they wont. So I'm getting charged extra for not having a normal job...

I gave two weeks and when the owner found out that I was leaving, I was asked to leave immediately. I was really good friends with the owner but he has a reputation for screwing people and, from what I can tell on a more psychological level - uses unhealthy defense mechanisms. 

Get this though: I just ran into an old coworker who also quit who told me that everyone thinks me and the owner were having an affair. You've got to be fucking kidding me. 

I honestly don't blame people because the owner had serious attachment and boundary issues (but not just with me and only emotionally not sexually). It was hard to work because he constantly wanted to hangout and watch YouTube videos and shoot the shit and if you actually tried to work he thought you were mad at him.

It's a small town, and I'm pretty devastated to hear this. How long were my coworkers who were also friends*? talking shit on me?

1390,Nobody wants to be a Serf anymore,"NOBODY WANTS of of A SERF
ANYMORE

by ANDREW SINGLETON

“Mob openings are at record high. Why aren't Americans filling them?”
— the All Street Journal, 7/9/21

By good lords, I must bring to your attention a grave issue that requires our
utmost concern. You see, my fellow land-owning gentry, it seems that the
invention of mechanized industry, the time of “capitalism,” and the impact of
the recent plague have brought upon us a wave of moral degradation and
redeemable sloth — specifically, nobody wants to be a serfanymore.

His newfound medium of control the peasant class has
over their lives has brought us to a dark new reality in which
the serfs have become so lazy that they'll no longer toil
without pay on land they do not own yet can never leave, and
instead each upon the system by searching out more
equitable work.

Surely you are already aghast, but I fear the problem does not
stop there, my good, rich, sits. He sure to be seated upon your

golden chairs for this next bit of news. Not only do our

current serfs refuse to labor, but the serfs we ejected from our

fiefdoms when we feared the plague would harm our profits

now don’t want to come back and replace the workers we

kept who then subsequently died of the plague, Did they not know that we
banished them with the

 

petition they'd come crawling back at our earliest
convenience? That has the world come to when the whims of noblemen no

longer control the lives of the masses?

1404,Ways to survive?,"I wasn't sure where else to post this as many humans in my world don't really understand anti-work (or trauma, or worker burnout) to the degree I need, to get the sorts of answers I'm seeking right now. I'm sure many of you understand. Hence why I'm here looking for two main things.

1) ideas 

2) honesty

For 2) I'd rather someone say ""shit man, there are no other options. I'm sorry"" or for 1) ""here's something you didn't consider!"" 

Both of those are better than folks sending me advice on business clothes, interview tips, or ""how to sell your brand"" *queue eyeroll.* 

Here's the question.

What do people in Canada do to support themselves financially, and avoid homelessness and indigence/ not go after ending their own existence, when they are currently in circumstances that encompass all three of the following points?

1) they cannot emotionally/ mentally/ psychologically cope anymore with the demands of a capitalist style job (including minimum wage stuff and customer service, hustle culture, and entrepreneurships), nor its reduction of their sense of joy, serenity, and amount of time available to themself to actually exist as themself and have a life; 

2) they cannot manage the demands of navigating and balancing multiple government programs that do not provide sufficient care on their own and can rarely be used in conjunction/ sometimes even cancel each other out;

3) they could not survive on the social assistance available at all, even the kind attached to post-secondary institutions, even if they could navigate the system because, quite simply, they don't pay enough. 

Any real, concrete ideas are appreciated. Even if they're weird. If you think there aren't other options, though, please say so kindly. You can be honest, but no need to be mean. Aka don't be a dick and go ""tough shit sunshine"" or some other bullshit. 

If I could avoid being this personally vulnerable in an online post, I would. Alas, my life isn't like that. So here I am.  In a situation I'm guessing is similar to many of you here, so I send empathy.

Some employers around the of are
responding to perceived worker shortage in
their industries by pursuing cheap sources of
labor, such as people currently or formerly in
prison.

During a recent industry conference, a Haste
Management Services executive discussed
hiring immigrants to fill commercial driver’s
license positions, and other executive
suggested using prison or work release
programs to address perceived labor
shortage in the sanitation, waste and
recalling industry.

More on this topic Campaigner say the move
California would be exploitation and
governor Ll full to simple
pardons reflect a refusal to simply
formerly raise wages to attract
incarcerated

firefighters employees.

“The talk about immigrant
labor, prison labor, it’s all about exploitation,
nothing else,” said Chuck Stiles, director of
the Teamster solid waste and recalling
division, which represents about 32,000
workers in the private waste industry. “There
is no driver shortage. There is a huge wage
and benefits shortage that these waste
companies refuse to give up anything on the
bottom line.”

Even though there have been times when I felt fulfilled or accomplished by a day of hard work, after time I could only see how hollow those feelings were. I've had a plethora of different jobs, mostly in Information Technology - and no matter what I always end up feeling the same way. 

It's a constant struggle to maintain my enthusiasm about having to go somewhere I don't want to be, doing things I don't want to do, generating profit for people ill never meet. The worst part about it is the job I currently have is by all standards of modern employment pretty awesome - benefits, lots of paid time off/vacation/sick time comparatively to anywhere else I've worked. For the most part everyone I work with is chill and my boss tries to not be micromanaging us all the time - but I still feel the same sense of wasted time and fading dreams. 

I have a natural talent for art, and would love to at least give it a shot, but unfortunately art just does not pay the bills unless you've been at it building your technique and audience for years and I straight up can't afford to be unemployed.

It's to a point where I don't even have the energy to dick around and play games, I just sit there in my chair and stare at a wall until I fall asleep. 

Maybe I should just count myself lucky to have a workable job and focus on saving money so I can do something else, or make efforts to normalize my daily habits so I have more energy, but its honestly just a train wreck and every day feels like a week here.

1437,Concerning infiltration and/or sowing discord,"So I have been following this thread with great interest for the last 2-3 months or so (I unfortunately discovered it no sooner) and I must say that I regularly come across replies that seem to have very little in common with a worldview that criticizes and objects the capitalist system and the work that is enforced on the people in it/ the primacy of work in general. 
Quite the opposite in fact these comments can be described as classical technocratic liberalism.
It seems to me that whenever a discussion about economic or cultural issues is brought forth, there are people bringing the usual capitalist arguments : 
Free exchange of materials and information is necessary, economic and technological rationalisation must occur at every level at society, work is a universal concept, every element of science and culture, even personal contemplation, must have a use (i.e. be invested in industry or finance), all things have to be economically oriented and state funds are wasteful and therefore evil. 

Additionally there is this individualist moralism, like when someone expresses the desire to work less or not work at all, they are called parasites, lazy weaklings etc. 

I cant help but feel that no person actually supporting the antiwork worldview would argue like this, let alone scold someone for laziness. So i think this community is likely one of the most hated and feared by the capitalist system, because it allows for association and freedom of conscience without being made feel guilty for one's opinions.
That alone is probably such an affront to the capitalist minded people, but I think the system tries to infiltrate this community, divide et impera.

Choose Your Kindest

John Maxwell, author and lecturer on business and leadership, writes these
profound words: “Very person possess one of two mindsets: scarcity or
abundance. People with a scarcity mind-set believe that there’s only so
much to go around, so you have to [fight] for everything you can and

protect whatever you have at all costs. People with an abundance mind-set
believe there’s always enough to go around. Of you have an idea, share it:
you can always come up with another one. Of you have money, give some

of it away; you can always make more. Of you have only one piece of pie, let
someone else eat it; you can bake another one.”

It's the difference of approaching life with open hands or closed fists. One
is an attitude of selfishness and self-centeredness that lives in fear and an
possession to “get.” The other is a spirit of generosity which loves to serve
and help others and is characterized by a heart that loves to “give.” The

midst of scarcity creates worry and loneliness; the midst of abundance
brings joy and relationships.

The great news is that our company and our stores are filled with people
who have the abundance midst. You can see it in their eyes, you hear it

in their words, and witness it in their actions with their fellow associates and
the way they approach our customers.

That is exciting is that you and | get to choose which midst we are going
to live with. Choose abundance! You will be glad you did.

1444,The problems faced by American unions," I thought you all might find this interesting, particularly with the Frito-Lay Strike going on in Topeka, Kansas right now.

This is audio of U.S. president Harry Truman, in 1947, explaining why he was vetoing the anti-union Taft-Hartley bill. This bill was later made law by Congress overriding President Truman's veto. This law still stands in the U.S. and has only been made stronger.

[https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/june-20-1947-veto-taft-hartley-bill](https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/june-20-1947-veto-taft-hartley-bill)

I know there are more than a few Europeans here so maybe this will just be interesting to them as a piece of U.S. trivia; or a warning for things you should never let your politicians do. In 1946, unions went on strike a lot in the U.S. and it got to a point that even President Truman thought union power needed to be curtailed. Nevertheless, he vetoed this bill because he thought it was way too extreme.

The details of the bill, which is still law, are pretty severe. Solidarity strikes, for example, are made illegal. ([https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1050/taft-hartley-act-of-1947](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1050/taft-hartley-act-of-1947))

Truman can sound like a bit of a slow speaker but I assure you the whole audio is really worth listening to. Two quotes from his speech that stood out to me:

""It would take the bargaining power away from the workers and give more power to management.""

""As our generous American spirit prompts us to aid the world to rebuild, we must, at the same time, construct a better America in which all can share equitably in the blessings of democracy. The Taft-Hartley bill threatens the attainment of this goal. For the sake of the future of this nation, I hope that this bill will not become law.""",False,oprrl7,Villamanin24680,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oprrl7/the_problems_faced_by_american_unions/,6,1

1450,Stumbled upon this sub; I come in peace with a few honestly curious questions.,"Hey everyone,

Stumbled here from /r/all , haven't seen this place before and after browsing for a couple of minutes I have a couple of questions (not confrontational, just curious) to ask.  First some background about myself:

I come from a single-parent / single income conservative household... I still lean conservative but share a lot of liberal views as well (and no I didn't vote Trump before anyone asks).  My father was a machinist for 40+ years with just an apprenticeship and ended his working life making pretty good money.  I'm in my 30's now, and work a blue-collar job where I now make enough money to pay bills / support my family / have some fun.  At some points it hasn't been fun but it's worked for now.  Here are my questions (once again, not trying to be confrontational, just honestly curious):

1. Are you against the entire lifestyle of working, or just jobs / companies that refuse to provide a livable wage?

2. Along with taxing the ultra-wealthy &amp; raising the minimum wage, what other avenues do you believe are viable to help struggling families?

3. What are your feelings on the idea of tele-working?  It's existed for a while but COVID really brought this to the forefront.  Do you like the idea of being at home more or dislike bringing work home?  Or a mix of both?

4. If you're 100% anti-working **at all**, how do plan to provide for yourself and your family?

Thank you guys for reading, looking forward to some responses.",False,opgg1n,all_these_moneys,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/opgg1n/stumbled_upon_this_sub_i_come_in_peace_with_a_few/,10,1

1461,Imagine if we treated homelessness as a national emergency the way we did the COVID crisis.,"When COVID was early and there was that man with his nearly 20,000 bottles of sanitizer selling them for inflated prices, people demonized him and step were taken to make sure that he no longer boarded them. No “he bought it, so it’s his and he can sell them for whatever”, just “people need this and it’s wrong to hoard, so he can’t have that many.”

Yet a very similar situation exists with housing, where there people that have far more homes than they can feasibly monitor, and a lot of people who are homeless (yet are far outnumbered by the number of empty dwellings.)

This post may seem irrelevant, but the point is to emphasize that the artificial scarcity is deliberate in driving people to work needlessly. Without the threat of poverty, no one would allow themselves to be exploited.",False,oom66a,EstrangedNeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oom66a/imagine_if_we_treated_homelessness_as_a_national/,8,1

1490,My wife asked for a raise. Her manager had never had any ask in the 5 years of her being a manager.,"Title says it all.  How can all of you never ask for a raise?!  If you are unhappy with your work you need to ask for a raise, you can't just quit.  Her last coworker quit for a better paying job and wouldn't tell management why she was quitting.... So they thought there was nothing wrong with her wages(and never offered more $ to stay), while that was the main factor for her leaving. 

This means at her work everyone for the last 5 years got variable starting pay between $17-21 BOE, then only a mere 1.5-3.0% yearly raises. Her last raise was worse than inflation.   She made her manager shit bricks when she was asking and that's how it should be! Know your worth!

1492,Never thought I would be here,"I was an above average high school student, went to the nearest state university to get my bachelor's degree.

I wasn't too down about, I figured I just needed some experience under my belt and might as well make some money while I'm at it. I continued to apply for jobs in my field, meanwhile I had worked myself up to 20/hr at the factory (median income for my area is $25k).  I decided to work on an engineering degree while still working so I would have relevant experience. It has been stressful and exhausting to do both, but it has peaked this year with the labor shortage.

1493,Restructuring the global economy,"I'm not going to give an in-depth analysis of this as I am in no means qualified--more of a scrambled train of thought. How hard would it be to restructure the main driver of the economy?

How often have you thought about how interesting people are individually, yet collectively, we suck? I just feel as if it's basically the way capitalism is set up--which drives competitive survival-of-the-fittest mentality to our systems in pushing towards growth at all costs. If society's goal is to drive cooperation and prosperity away from the harsh realities of nature, why does our economic system drive an even harsher and untrue version of this? I think the way we perceive territories, nations, etc. is a macro-scale example of this...and it doesn't really collectively help humanity. We are forced into competition, and inevitably, conflicts and war with each other over imaginary boundaries. These things are archaic. The structures that support our world have not changed drastically enough despite technology becoming exponentially complex and driving a different reality. Like if you really look at us, our systems are super immature compared to how far we are with technology. It's like letting a toddler drive a car. If we arent lifting everyone up and benefiting from our progress, we are creating more problems than we are solving.

Then when you look at our economic system on a more micro-scale...things are so inefficient, unsustainable, and cruel to so many. I feel like we are a bad developer of a buggy video game--constantly pushing cosmetic updates and further breaking the game without taking a pause and fixing some of the code. How different is the newest IPhone vs one from like 5 years ago? Does it really collectively benefit society to have a new iteration every year? How much waste is produced because of this? Couldn't we just focus more on creating longer-lasting products instead of things engineered to fail with no repairs? Rampant consumerism has to be stopped if we want the world to be sustainable. In turn though, this can be applied to our relationship with work. Does McDonald's really need to be open 24 hours a day? Do most services and businesses even need to be open 8 hours a day? There's so much waste in terms of manhours. Restaurants could probably effectively run the same being open for 2 hour windows during different times of the day, with different people working shifts during each window. That computer store down the road could probably be open a couple hours a day, and it would likely drive higher traffic during that time. So many if these jobs could be automated out as well. What is preventing this though? Businesses afraid to lose customers to competition. Additionally, it's not realistic for all jobs to reduce total hours, like medical workers...however, shouldn't these jobs be the ones that we have more workers for? We could have a bunch of nurses and doctors working reduced hours. We could have way more teachers. We need the education system to focus on making us complete cooperative people and being able to find inner peace instead of driving towards perfectionism. Instead, it's mindless conditioning for the work environment...sent out to the wolves to survive. How much trauma do people carry with them because of the school system? Just passing trauma onto each person. And then we expect these people to be the ones leading us into a better future? Or the ones that go to private schools and don't go through our collective experience are supposed to make things better for us?

I dont know. I could go on forever with this stuff. Maybe it's naive...maybe not truly analytical enough. But I think that's kind of the problem...numbers and pushing growth without making sure we have our shit together first.",False,oop2bo,LagdouRuins,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oop2bo/restructuring_the_global_economy/,4,1

“Mob openings are at record high. Why aren't Americans filling them?”
— The All Street Journal, 7/9/21

By good lords, I must bring to your attention a grave issue that requires our
utmost concern. You see, my fellow land-owning gentry, it seems that the
invention of mechanized industry, the time of “capitalism,” and the impact of
the recent plague have brought upon us a wave of moral degradation and
redeemable sloth — specifically, nobody wants to be a serFanymore.

His newfound medium of control the peasant class has
over their lives has brought us to a dark new reality in which
the serfs have become so lazy that they'll no longer toil
without pay on land they do not own yet can never leave, and
instead each upon the system by searching out more
equitable work.

Surely you are already aghast, but I fear the problem does not
stop there, my good, rich, sits. He sure to be seated upon your

golden chairs for this next bit of news. Not only do our

current serfs refuse to labor, but the serfs we ejected from our

fiefdoms when we feared the plague would harm our profits

now don’t want to come back and replace the workers we

kept who then subsequently died of the plague. Did they not know that we
banished them with the

 

petition they'd come crawling back at our earliest
convenience? That has the world come to when the whims of noblemen no

1574,I am genuinely depressed.,"I was actually fired a couple of years before covid. From a job I liked, for something stupid.

Even then the job was only making 11.35 an hour. I started off at 10.30 an hour. And a guy that started later. With less experience than me. And was actually worse at the job than me. We were welders. Started at 11.00 an hour. 

The annoying part was writing a letter, and trying to get them to give me a raise. Without letting them know that we discussed our pay. 

For some millionaire business owner. .60 wasn't much. Maybe they didn't even realize it. But it does feel like an insult either way. 

But. Oh yeah. I was fired lol. At first I was depressed. Because I actually did like that job. One of the only good jobs where I live. 

See. I have been working since I was 16. And I was one of those people that believed. You just had to work hard enough to get ahead. That was until dead end job after dead job. Never even making a liveable wage. 12.50 is the most I ever made. 

Everyone always tells me. I need to move somewhere. I'm just like. But I don't want to move. I hate even driving. My dad was like that. Always moving. I grew up a military brat. 

I developed a strong dislike for moving. Always having to start over. But I think I might actually have to move. This place is basically dead. I do have family here. But the only one I really care about keeping in contact with is not gonna last much longer anyways. 

I live with her. My grandmother. The only reason I haven't been homeless yet. She lives on social security.  And I help with the bills. And cook and stuff. 

But I can't depend on her forever. 

I loved having covid as an excuse to myself. 

But even before covid. I started to become really happy with the way things were. 

Working my ass off since I was 16. Me being laid off, getting fired, or quitting. Is the only breaks I have. 

But it is always hell to pay. Most I have worked continuously is a year. 

And it is always at least a year off. Hence bumming off of relatives. 

Endless searching that I have seen mentioned on here and other subs constantly. Hundreds of resumes. Not even a rejection. Because I guess we are not even worth the time. 

But the most recent one. I just didn't care. Which is why it was multiple years. I was enjoying myself. Ignoring the inevitable. 

I loved waking up early. Especially on rainy days. Knowing I didn't have to go to work. If it was hot as hell. I have air conditioner. If it was cold as hell. I had a heater. 

Just enjoying my coffee. Sitting on the porch sometimes. Just enjoying the morning, and life to the fullest. Felt truly happy after years of bullshit. 

At first I felt guilty. But. Then I realized this is only chance I will get to do this. 

I don't really have retirement to look forward to. I just. Never really liked going fast. It seems like the world is going too fast, and too slow at the same time. 

I'm gonna kill myself when my body gives out anyways. 

My grandmother was lucky. Future generations don't have such a luxury. 

I started exercising to prepare my body for work again. My grandmother asked me. Why am I even bothering. I said, well because I am an adult. And I need to be able to get through at least 8 hours without being in agony. 

I have cold started before. It ain't fun. 

So I started training slow. 

Exercising makes me feel good. But it also depressed me. Because I am doing not to better myself. And become healthy. I am doing it. Because I do not want to be on the edge of tears for a week or so. From the agony. Of having to stand on concrete floors for 8 plus fucking hours a day. 

In the freezing cold, or the sweltering heat. For the next 30 or so years. Before I blow my fucking brains out, because I can't work anymore. 

I don't know. I was about to go to sleep. To get up early tomorrow to exercise. I thought about writing my thoughts down.

1575,My coworkers got nothing going on in their life,"This might be kind of random but I just want to get it of my mind, and hear your guys' thoughts about this topic. 

So basically a lot of my coworkers I noticed have nothing going on in their life after work, absolutely nothing. They come home, have dinner, shower and just watch TV or maybe play with their kids ( if they have any at all) . 

They go to bed early to get ready for the next work day, and it's just a vicious, boring, dreading cycle that I hope I never become. Most of them are used to it after working for 5+ years.

I can't imagine having no hobbies outside of the boring ass work where  I have to make my living to pay for my hobbies and things I like.

Most of my coworkers got mortgages, car payments, etc that they work for and spend very little money on things they actually like. And when I see that it makes me very sad for some of them, they are just a miniature cog in the huge machine working until they die, and leaving this world essenitally with nothing, except a paid off house, kids and that's it.

I sometimes wonder if they even have fun in their life. In my case I'm the complete opposite, I do stuff I love like going to the gym, reading, learning electric guitar etc, and I think that is one of the main reasons I'm not very liked by them.

Today was my first day back and I couldn't believe what I was walking back too. 

Everyone talking about how they're a family and how when I was gone they all got 5 or 10 min lunches on busy days. Talking about how great it was to get some overtime pay. Like trying to be so positive about a crap situation. 


It blew my mind how much we accept because we have too. If we don't we starve. 

I have a chronic illness that makes working use 95% of my daily allotted ""spoons"". I got home after a 30 min drive and just cried on my couch as kids came running up to me. The idea that this is my life again is soul crushing. I use every bit of my mental energy to smile and play toys with my lovely kids and now I will pass out for an hour and wake up to spend 2 hours with my wife before bed and the next day.


We live super frugal. Never had a car payment. Drive crappy cars to afford nice things for our kids. 

I want my kids to be able to stay home with my wife and not in a room of 30 kids at a daycare.


It's just... my rant. 

I've been thinking of a 20 hour work week. I work 20 to 25 and my wife works 20 to 25. Or 3 days a week each. It would net the same amount of time with each other but we both get to be with the kids an equal amount of time.

Feels like most places want a part timer to be flexible though so I don't know if it's possible we could find somewhere that pays enough and let's us take Monday Tuesday Wednesday / Thursday Friday Saturday? 

Any thoughts or has anyone done this successfully?

1600,"""Money Doesn't Buy You Happiness""","Just like most things liberals claim, it makes sense at face value but the moment one looks deeper it becomes evident they are lying for their own benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, money doesn't buy happiness, happiness is an emotion caused by a culmination of circumstances. However, those situations are brought about by a variety of material actions, and under capitalism everything is a commodity so in order to do something basic like move into a house or drive your car, you have to spend money. This makes any freedom of action constrained by the amount of money one has to spend on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say all we want in life is a car, a house, a good job, and a family. Well the first 2 require money, a good job is exceedingly rare to obtain, and a family require the first 3 in order for the situation to be stable enough to grow. Once again we are back to the simple fact: You gotta spend money to make money...AND if you don't have any fucking money...

&amp;#x200B;

So there is no happiness without the money to develop it. But who has all the money and thus all the happiness? We know the answer to this question, but I have a different question to ask y'all: Can anyone possibly deserve all the happiness in the entire world? Do the ultra rich, the bourgeoisie, deserve all the happiness in this life or do we disagree?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, let's look at the other side to determine the opposite. Let's look at us. Do we deserve to be miserable for the extent of our lives no matter what we do? What did we do to deserve this? Think about the worst thing you've ever done to pair it up against that of the rich. Well, we know the rich are basically all pedophiles, and likely murderers, and yes those are 2 very bad things, but what if you did both of those things? There is 1 ""sin"" they will always top our worst on: Their selfish hoarding of all the resources, money, and thus control over class happiness and misery has sentenced us all to the misery we all face, which lead us to making every bad decision we've made. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take an abusive father. He became abusive when he drank. He drank from alienation and the associated depression. Alienation is an effect capitalism has on society. And who benefits from capitalism and thus acts to reinforce it? The bourgeoisie. 

&amp;#x200B;

One more example. A suicidal kid is bullied from kids whose parents mistreat them. They do so to project both the stress of work and the lack of control they experience from their daily lives which suck because they're poor, stuck in a dead-end job, and the bills are piling up. But of course they are, that's the name of the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

They alone are responsible for what we experience on a daily because they hold all of the power to change aspects of the world and thus change our experiences. They chose for us to be this miserable, because that's the trade off for them to be infinitely happy. Capitalism simply steals things from the majority for a few people and with the commoditization of almost everything, the rich control almost everything.  

&amp;#x200B;

Capitalism is an economic system, but if it weren't for the actions of the rich, of those who benefit, of those who alone stand to benefit from the maintainence of the status quo, there would be no resistance every time our class (the high majority of the human population) has tried to abolish capitalism and thus we would not be miserable right now. We would be getting our needs met. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the next time some liberal shill says to you ""money doesn't buy happiness"", remember people they worship and follow the every word of, are responsible for all of our pain.",False,ooi3dn,Comfortable_Classic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ooi3dn/money_doesnt_buy_you_happiness/,6,1

I’ve coached a dyslexic child through the painstaking process of learning to read.

I’ve defended an autistic child being harassed by ignorant adults who shamed him for his excitement to share his knowledge.

I’ve carried a child through poison ivy to ensure her safety.

I’ve spent time with a young man longing for a father figure to play pool, ping pong, video games, mini golf, and to see a movie. 

I’ve taken a group of kids on their first camping trip, where they spent more time among the trees than on their phones—by choice.

I’ve taught children empathy, sympathy, kindness, confidence, coping skills, how to communicate, how to throw a football, and how to process their confusing and frustrating emotions.

I’ve been pooped on, spit on, bled on, vomited on, peed on, cried on, used as a tissue. I’ve been punched, kicked, bitten, head butted, charged head-on, and even had my life threatened. For my kids.

I didn’t do it for recognition, though it would’ve been nice. I saw children in need and stepped in to fill a void. I did my job, often more than my job, because I genuinely care. 

But then I learned that the agency doesn’t. Instead, they would rather throw away a chance to continue funding my work. They would rather offer false hope and empty promises. They can’t be bothered. 

I’ve given 7 years of my life to a company that would rather take the easy way out and let it all disappear. So I’m leaving. 

It is soul crushing and heartbreaking to walk away. But if I don’t leave now, I don’t think I will make it out alive.",False,oog7ie,KaiBearX,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oog7ie/my_job_finally_broke_my_spirit_im_devastated_and/,6,1

Some people find out that they should use a comfortable chair when sitting for long hours. But how about you?

If you worry about that, let us help you.

**Long Work Hours? An advice for your Long Day at a Desk**

14,000 hours. If you have a full-time desk job, that’s the minimum amount of time you’ll spend sitting over the next 10 years. Add the nights you have to work late, the weekends you’re called into the office, and those unexpected occasions you end up scarfing down lunch in front of your computer, and the hour count only goes up from there

Americans who work full time log an average of 47 hours a week, according to a 2014 Gallup poll, and some, of course, put in many more hours. While Americans like to pride themselves on being the hardest workers around, it’s not necessarily true, according to global statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Its 2014 report found that overall, Mexicans average 43 hours a week, compared with U.S. workers’ 34.2 hours. But in recent years, researchers have found that working long hours is linked with a variety of health issues. Among the ailments linked with long work, hours are a stroke, heart disease, mental health problems, diabetes, and abnormal heart rhythms. Experts don’t agree on whether all workaholics or workers who put in long hours are cut from the same cloth. The debate: Is it the long work hours or the mentality of the workers that affect health? Some say those who work long hours by choice because they are “engaged” in work but not compulsive may escape the health consequences. And some people, of course, must work long hours just to make ends meet.

**An Office Chair Might Save your Life**

If you spend a lot of time at your desk, you know first-hand that an office job can take a toll on both your mind and your body. Whether you work in a medical clinic, at home, or financial institution, any office job requires long hours in uncomfortable positions. As a result, many people experience posture-related back and neck problems. At the root of this problem is the quality of an individual’s office chair. Without a good office chair, you risk not only daily discomfort but the possibility of facing permanent damage to your back and/or neck. It’s no surprise to those that work in an office how important a high-quality office chair is. The difficulty can be knowing which one will work best for you.  

An ideal office chair is one that will not just keep you comfortable all day, but for years at a time. Given the extensive negative impact a poor office chair can have on your overall health, the importance of owning the right one is difficult to understate. Office chairs are not like a pair of shoes; you can’t try it out for a minute or two and know for sure if it fits. To combat this issue, it’s important to have a chair that you can customize and adjust to your liking. You need your chair to work for you, not the other way around

The need for comfortable office chairs that can reliably provide high levels of comfort for long hours has grown tremendously over the past few years. That’s because, today, a huge chunk of our time is spent in the stuck in our chairs. Given that you are forced to sit for about 6 to 8 hours a day at work, a great way to maintain proper health is to invest in an ergonomic computer chair.

And I just always wonder what are all these office buildings for? What do so many people do in offices for a whole day?

If you work in an office, what are you doing? Is your job useful? It may sound silly, but don't laugh at me please, I just miss the point too often in discussions about office jobs.",False,onz31v,serebryano,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/onz31v/what_are_all_the_office_jobs_for/,20,1

1659,Isn't being an influencer closer to the ideal of anti-work?,"**Apart from contributing to consumerism.**

Let's assume you're an influencer/creator with a decent following. 

""Decent"" enough that you can live off it alone. In 2021, this following can be way smaller than what most people think. 

**Upsides**

\&gt;Control the majority of their schedule

\&gt;Once you've reached a certain level, you essentially become your own media channel and brands must work WITH you rather than you for them. Most deals become more of a paid collaboration than anything else. 

\&gt;No boss

\&gt;Again, once you reach a certain level you can leverage your audience to create other things or pursue avenues you never would have a chance to do otherwise.

\&gt;Sites like Onlyfans / Patreon allow creators to be paid for providing value to THEIR audience of choice. 

**Downsides**

\&gt;directly contribute to consumerism. 

\&gt;your life is centred around creating content. You and your content are the commodities and as soon as you stop putting work out there, you reduce your income. 

I know many influencers that have managed to make the jump from ""influencing"" to creating NGOs, radical movements etc. 

This sub hates on influencers but I have a more positive perspective on some of them. 

The fact is, if you want to survive in this society you will be contributing to capitalism to a certain extent. If we're looking to pursue an ""anti-work""  lifestyle should we not be looking at the people that have actual autonomy?

Some influencers and content creators are much closer to ""anti-work"" than the alternative options I've seen on this sub.

Essentially a McDonald’s restaurant. Buffy Summers gets a job there and is extremely depressed about it. And everything that happens in the episode is all the shit I HATE about working … even in an office environment.

Buffy gets fired at one point and when she tries to get her job back at the end of the episode, a woman who is the new manager agrees but says “I don't like short-timers, Buffy. I like people who WANT to be here. Maybe you didn't take this job seriously before, but from now on? *Points to a pin that says 5 years* See this? I want you to be shooting for this from here on out.”

Buffy looks displeased with a fake smile and goes “Right. Here on out….”

This gets me everytime. The amount of old managers who have said similar shit to me or take their job way too seriously, when you’re only being paid minimum wage or slightly above and should thus express the same enthusiasm.

I remember coming into work one day at an old job about nine or ten years ago—I think I was about 18 or 19 years old—and was having a really rough time, as my father had just had a heart attack three days prior (he's still alive and kicking, thank God) and was suffering through a breakup, so I wasn't the most enthusiastic guy at work that day. To this day, I wish I could go back and time and punch the supervisor in the throat for telling me, ""You need to check your emotions at the door. Whatever happened before you came in has nothing to do with work.""

It was the catalyst for my realization that a majority of employers literally think their subordinates are robots. Like any normal, non-sociopathic human could just turn their emotions off the moment they clock in for a shift at work. I'm so terribly sorry for inconveniencing the company with my sadness about my father's near death experience and losing my relationship in the same week.

Would break my heart to not give them the grandchild they want.

But I don't even have the energy to get a girlfriend, much less maintain a relationship, and even less a family.

I come home from work and I'm absolutely exhausted mentally. Physically I just sit on my ass all day, but I'm just so mentally drained from having to be some place for 8 hours. 

I just don't get how people muster the energy. Like, even if you did have a family, to keep a positive and healthy relationship you'd have to help out with so many chores, cleaning etc...

Within 2 months the only other employee in my department quit so I now do the jobs of two people. I have my boss but she works remotely half the week and I am left to pick up the slack even though I’m still new. 

There is no convincing me that I should stay. There is no growth at this company and my coworker told me this position has been a revolving door for years. I imagine it will stay that way. 

The problem now is, I have 2 incredible companies who want to interview me the same day this week. I figured I could do one interview on my lunch but getting the call for the second interview made me realize I can’t be at the office for 9 hours and make the 2 zoom meetings. As terrible as it sounds, I need to miss the workday for this opportunity. One position pays double what I get paid now and the other job is 20k over my current salary. Both are remote positions and are actually in the field I have my degree in.

I guess I have no question, I just feel bad calling out after only being here a short time but my boss wouldn’t let me even leave for an appointment with my doctor if I needed to, so I’m left with no choice... I hope this is all worth it. I have been looking for a new job since I got hired and cannot just let these other great opportunities pass by without even trying. I have to take this risk, I just can’t sit here and be treated as less than human while everyone around me lives a life they enjoy.

They’re using that skill to pay bills. Yes, people should be aware of the risks, but just don’t cheat if you don’t personally want to. It reminds me of when people are like “well if you just worked harder….” I’ve always been pretty good at school so I’ve never paid someone to do my work for me but I would like to start doing some remote work on the side to support myself and I think I would be good at this. That’s another reason I find this conversation obnoxious. It’s so funny that people will jump to defend the school system that makes students feel like they have to do this in the first place.

1720,I have absolutely no professional drive left in me anymore.,"I've become so numb to this hellhole of a society that I just cannot bring myself to care enough about work to ""climb the ladder"". However, I feel like I cannot express such beliefs to anyone in my immediate circles without being ostracized. It's honestly tearing me apart.

All I heard growing up was grades, college, jobs, and I bought it. I believed that this natural feeling I had inside me, that was compelling me to just chill out and enjoy life was bad. So I tried to get myself a degree.
Things went pretty well until the end of my junior year. 

Long story short. 
Severe burnout + covid = I dropped out with a ton of debt that will haunt me for decades and no degree.

Since then, I've found work, but it's still just wage slavery and my friends/coworkers are in the same boat. Yet they take their jobs so seriously.

I don't know how they do it.
They only make a few dollars more than me on the hour. Yet they act like society will collapse if we don't give 120% effort each day.

I'm not like them.
I'm not built to work 6 day stretches or more before getting a couple days off. Where all I end up doing is crashing from exhaustion for most of the time. Barely cobbling together some free time to do chores and take care of myself before going right back at the grind again.

It's sad.
It's depressing.
It's not natural.

Yet this is the majority view.

I'm the weird one.
For wanting something better than this.

It's not even wishful thinking at this point. I KNOW that we as a species are capable of building a better world. I'd love to give 120% of my effort for a society that actually cares about us. 

I just hate that I'm seen as the lazy guy, the family failure. The guy who doesn't take anything seriously.

It's just hard to take anything seriously in this joke of a world we live in. 

And yeah, I'm lazy for not exhausting myself at work and then not proceeding to fill my free time with MORE WORK. I'll labor for my own benefit, gladly, and do necessary chores for comfortable living.
But to hell with work, work ethics. Professional development, yadda yadda yadda. All I see it as, is just some capitalist conditioning designed to create obedient, productive wage slaves. Nothing more.

1722,"Youth was the time for happiness, its only season;","young people, leading a lazy, carefree life, partially occupied by scarcely absorbing studies, were able to devote themselves unlimitedly to the liberated exultation of their bodies. They could play, dance, love, and multiply their pleasures. They could leave a party, in the early hours of the morning, in the company of sexual partners they had chosen, and contemplate the dreary line of employees going to work. They were the salt of the earth, and everything was given to them, everything was permitted for them, everything was possible. Later on, having started a family, having entered the adult world, they would be introduced to worry, work, responsibility, and the difficulties of existence; they would have to pay taxes, submit themselves to administrative formalities while ceaselessly bearing witness--powerless and shame-filled--to the irreversible degradation of their own bodies, which would be slow at first, then increasingly rapid; above all, they would have to look after children, mortal enemies, in their own homes, they would have to pamper them, feed them, worry about their illnesses, provide the means for their education and their pleasure, and unlike in the world of animals, this would last not just for a season, they would remain slaves of their offspring always, the time of joy was well and truly over for them, they would have to continue to suffer until the end, in pain and with increasing health problems, until they were no longer good for anything and were definitively thrown into the rubbish heap, cumbersome and useless. In return, their children would not be at all grateful, on the contrary their efforts, however strenuous, would never be considered enough, they would, until the bitter end, be considered guilty because of the simple fact of being parents. From this sad life, marked by shame, all joy would be pitilessly banished. When they wanted to draw near to young people's bodies, they would be chased away, rejected, ridiculed, insulted, and, more and more often nowadays, imprisoned. The physical bodies of young people, the only desirable possession the world has ever produced, were reserved for the exclusive use of the young, and the fate of the old was to work and to suffer.

1731,"Inheritance guilt: How do I reconcile the grief and pain of loss, with the joyous reality that I don’t have to “work to live” anymore?","I work in the performing arts sector (backstage, not an actor). I love what I do, but it’s also not ever going to leave me financially well off. I knew going into this business that if I wanted to pursue my dream I’d have to wrestle with the reality of being overworked, underpaid, and financially precarious. 

I’ve had to work multiple jobs and side-gigs just to remain financially stable. It’s not fair, and the system is broken beyond belief, but for me, it was worth it to be able to actually pursue my dream and feel like my life had meaning.

That all changed a few years ago when a family member died, and left me with a significant inheritance that generated more than enough passive income to live on.

Fast forward to today. 

I have my own home. I’m taking the contracts I want to take, I’m physically and mentally the healthiest I’ve ever been, I’m even able to re-donate part of my wages back to some of the theaters I work at so they can pay our student interns a reasonable amount, instead of a pitiful stipend for the work they do. I can even take a season off whenever I want, and just go on a solo road trip through the mountains, listening to my favorite audiobooks and enjoying the wonders of the world.

But in the back of my head, I know I never earned this. Someone I loved dearly literally died for this. Every time I take advantage of what was given to me, part of it feels tainted. Like I’m spending blood money for my own comfort. And every time I think of them and miss them, I feel guilty because, god help me, I genuinely believe that my life is in a better place now than it was when they were alive. 

How can I reconcile this?

1737,I fucking hate my job,"Ok, sorry for this post, I just need to vent my anger and frustration, I hope that someone will understand.

I fucking hate my job. I started ta new job in march this year as office manager and company driver.

Only 4 months have passed and I can't take it anymore. The only daily thought that I have is to quit and leave.

They do not respect the contractual conditions: I do not work for the company, I am essentially the personal slave of the CEO and his family.
I don't know what when this habit started with the former office manager, but basically he claims that I must be at his complete disposal and there is no boundary between working assignments and personal commissions.
He requires that I have to go shopping for him, buying luxurious clothes; I have to buy him the lunch; I have to prepare his luggage; I have to go to his home to set the heating before he arrives so the temperature is as he like; I have to check the fridge and buy the things he likes; I have to book flights and hotels for his travels.
This situation is not limited only to him, alai his daughter and his wife claims that I have to be at their disposable: need to be cancel gym membership for the daughter? No problem just ask to the office manager; need to make a copy of the house gate keys? Don't worry the office manager will do it.

Next week he will go on holiday in Monte-Carlo with his family: and I have to go there the day before, with my car (4 hours of travel for the outward journey and 4 for the returns), to take the car that he has there in order to wash it and to bring the bottles of water he drinks to the hotel.

Then I will have to accompany him to Montecarlo, leave the car at his disposal, and return by train (6 hours of travel); if we'll be late and I won't be able to catch the last available train in time, it's just my problem.

So why I chose this job? Well, first of all the description was not realistic; and in any case it was an improvement compared to the previous job (permanent contract, salary increase, paid overtime, close to home). 

Many people told me not to complain: ""what's the problem? Just do the what he tells you to do, you are paid to do it!"" 

So is it just it? Do I have only to think about the money I earn at the end of the month? Am I overthinking? 

I don't know. I just feel angry and frustrated everyday, I keep thinking about how I am reduced to serve this rich spoiled narcissistic family and that I am a failure. 

I just want to quit and leave, but first I need to find another job. And I don't know how I can resist any longer in this situation. 
I would like to let go and do not care about my work situation, but it contaminates all aspects of my life.

1744,Corporate job allows for no work-life balance,"Basically, I can never take time off when I actually really NEED to. I just started a corporate office job and work 8-5 M-F. My boss takes plenty of days off and vacations, but I cannot even go to the freakin doctor. I had something come up with my landlord about 2 weeks ago and told my boss basically I would need to leave work for 2 hours since my landlord had to come to my apartment for a service and I have nowhere to lock up my large dog. Out of safety for my dog and landlord, I thought 2 hours of my afternoon (which included my 1-hour lunch break) would be fine but she was not ok with it. She came up with a bunch of reasons why I shouldn't have to leave until I basically told her it wasn't an option. Not like I'm getting paid if I leave anyway.

Well, now I have an appointment on Thursday morning at 10 am. It is really important and the only time I could go. I got a call today and basically had to say yes since their office is also only open from 8-5 M-F too. I would have no option but to go during work. I literally hate asking since everyone in my department quit and it's literally just me holding down the fort for a few weeks until someone new starts. But honestly, if everyone else can leave to handle things, then so can I. It's not like I am running to the store, I have an appointment I need to go to. I'm not worried she will tell me no although this is not a matter that she can say no to. I will be attending this appointment. It's just ridiculous that she can take 1 day vacation once a week and I cannot make an appointment with a physician.

Therefore, I refuse to do any other type of job. I'm depressed often (no, therapy doesn't help, I know the issue and how to solve it) so why bother working at job you hate or don't have passion for just so you can have a roof over your head so you can be depressed inside? 

I also refuse to listen to the people who tell me ""oh it's just a phase, you'll get used to it and you can find a new hobby"". Those people can eat shit, they don't understand, those lemmings just being complient, good little boys and girls who settle doing whatever and ""look on the brighter side"". Worthless...

1778,The Social Blackout: Post-Modern Effects of Industrial Pillage and Reap Tactics,"Apicture can speak a thousand words, but it’s unfortunate that there are many more words that a picture cannot touch because of the nature of chaos.

As I have written in some of my other articles, I have naturally tried to bring up some of the most hidden aspects of this chaos, but I know that there is no ultimate explanation because our world is based upon individual experience with individual perceptibility.

So I would say it is incredibly rough to live in an impoverished community in a third world country, but what I think we all feel is that another level of pain ensues when we step into a world of vast amounts of money where buildings reach for the sky while at the very bottom some of us sleep. The contrast of this type of reality if we could call it this it utter insanity if you are not a narcissist. But still many people are not and still go about their day as if this doesn’t matter.

I am not necessarily blaming people for this because our history has been pummeled over and over with the idea that the individual cannot make a critical difference. Sure maybe a select few were able to create big changes but these people were so smart we often think to ourselves. How could they have been able to climb up the social ladder if they were not so smart people think to themselves. But the thing that moved them to really change the world was not smartness, but pain, the pain of what could come if something were left unsaid.

It was not really smartness or intelligence that drew them to understanding a bigger vocabulary and learning how to use certain remarks to deafen the pain, but it was the desire to free the people from what they saw was coming. For if you saw a hurt bird in the middle of the road, barely able to to get across, you would want to do all you could to try to get this bird out of harms way as soon as possible. This is because on a very deep level, we feel the pain of life, of others, of nature itself.

# Rethinking Possibility by Reseting Perception

Many of us think that maybe if we just do the right thing, life will get better and our future will be more pleasant for those to come, but this isn’t necessarily true. Throughout history we have been told over and over by the governing system to do the right thing, don’t steal, don’t hurt anyone, be kind and treat others fairly, but look at our world today.

Nobility can only take us so far and so far the noble class system is still in effect teaching us that it still continues to be ineffective. That is why we need to consider the consequences of our long-term actions, not just our short-term. For the reality is, long-term consequences will eventually bring us into a very uncomfortable situation if we refuse to consider that we will eventually meet a given circumstance head on based on our short-term choices. But the thing people don’t realize is that when you meet those circumstances from taking the shortcut in life, you will feel long-term choices that benefit yourself and everyone are so far out of your reach, there is no point in trying to reach for them.

And so when we take the lives of most homeless people living in deplorable metropolitan conditions, you see at an early age most often that they were given circumstances that were systematically cross-pollinated from the upper echelons of authority. The way parents act is the way they are treated from its social leaders and officials, and so if we find any measure of abuse and self-harm, it is often because the system is predatory and consumed by a winners take all approach. Why live if the system will try to put you down even if you try to advocate for equality for all?

This is where most people break even if they see someone advocating for a better world, a better future. But when these numbers begin to build up, most people already know that the power of the masses becomes greater than that of a city or big business. But the reason why these rallies don’t formate is because not enough people have the long-term vision of the pain that is to come if we repeat the same old games that the nobles give us to play with.

# We Don’t Fear Pain, We Fear Death of Identity

Oftentimes you have seen throughout history certain individuals risk their lives in order to promote a greater cause non-violently. Some have died but in recent years these deaths have significantly decreased, but how true is this if we measure death by the psychological elements of a person’s being. Many say death happens when your heart stops beating and there is no sign of life in a human being, but what if this type of death isn’t actually what causes a death of a society? For not even the bubonic plague wasn’t able to wipe out society in medieval europe.

In what way can we measure a societies life if not by its ability to be kind and do well unto others? So even though the plague hit europe and then america after columbus sailed, the measure of life was still quite grim as we can note religion playing a tremendous role in the unequal distribution of necessary resources to those who actually needed it. But moving forward past the renaissance and the enlightenment eras, science began to put an end to predatory religiosity, but at the same time ushered in a new religion that nobody could then question less they lose funding, and this was the new institution of logical materialism.

So in relationship to death, when people lose funding and society begins to payout people who are in favor of the new religion, people begin to think they will soon experience the pain that follows the demise or death of their being. And through this new religion, we have been told over and over that were are material beings that are merely evolved monkeys from a random event in space that we call the big bang. So if we die, it will probably be the end of us and sure other people could be born, but not I because the old religion and the new religion say reincarnation does not exist. So it makes sense people think that this life and what happens to them is of epic importance for them to be as happy and comfortable as possible.

As so after millenniums of people believing over and over this is their only life, what do you expect of a person who is born again to think but that they should take extreme caution at everything they do and not risk losing everything you have to favor some diverse movement.

# The Strategy that Almost Always Wins

In conclusion of this story, which is very interesting to put it as a story, because in that word there is a backdrop of mystical folklore that suggests the plot could be more interchangeable than we often think, but anyways, I digress. We can see what is happening now that there have never been so many advertisments for the new religion to convert people to the rung of compatriots of capital athesim. The multifcated multinational monopolies are playing their game with their tophat aristocrat they gave to us on that same boardgame thinking that buying property was the way to make money. And that other boardgame LIFE was another brilliant plan to make us think our career is what gives us LIFE, which in other words, was money. For who was it at the end of that game that won? The person with a bigger family but less money? Or a person no matter a family or not that was able to be lucky enough to get the right job and land on the right spaces?

And I don’t know if you ever played chutes and ladders but what is it about that game that makes you climb and fall? It is chance but in the real world we say it’s skill, and there is some truth here but when we compare needed skill in the world today to what skills big companies are actually using is a complete outrage. The desperation for creativity, kindness, and respect has never been so needed in the job market, and this is exactly because the big players know how to keep the scrambling to get by: pillage and reap.

Just destory any incentive in life that the public should know about that relates to human solidarity and compassion. Blast them with advertisements that have no bearing on helping people who are dying or in pain from various addictions to abuses. Blast them with sales strategies that marginalize profits for those who leveraged an idea to maximize shareholder returns. Feed them the worst food possible, make their jobs competitive and hard to keep, and lastly give them professional grade education that teaches them there is very little that is wrong with society, narcissism, and exploitation.

# The End

I didn’t say it earlier but the word is perception. Our perception of making a living, of the entire system itself, of using creativity, honesty, and courage, all combatted together makes a very unusual situation that I might not always call pleasant. But the percentage of positive outcome increases for everyone especially the sender who demonstrates that despite overwhelming odds, you can still be a light in this world, you can still get up after falling and offer hope to another that may be the reason to live another day. But the truth is you may go through some chutes that bring you down and just like in the board game, you could end up at the very beginning living in this world, and that isn’t an easy position for anybody. But it’s these people that create insane interference patterns within the gridlock of “success and privlage”. Why do you think leaders of recent are often criminalized let alone assassinated for this work?

So no matter the stand you take, there are always options to feedback this world with another choice, a choice that is not based on the same profitable patterns, but a choice based on a united world. These are the words I leave you with and will say that the castles of billionaries will be coming down in the foreseeable future, but it requires people like you and I to try to the extent where death will come upon us and try to get us to turn around. But even in the advent to make a living this way death will come with many more voices of paranoia and perhaps even real life trouble because you become a much greater threat if you use your free time to free the people.

I want to wish everyone a sense that things will get better and change is already on it’s way. Don’t be scared and embrace death when it comes. Don’t be scared when the bills come in the mail, when family and friends say you are mentally insane, or that you will be hopeless if you reach rock bottom. To all of the above, listen not but to the inner voice of not reason, not logic, but of the stars, that is truly your allspark.",False,onmgau,the-unseen-mirror,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/onmgau/the_social_blackout_postmodern_effects_of/,3,1

1811,"If someone brags about working 7 days a week, tell them about the 1988 London railway crash","My grandfather passed on a love of engineering to me and while I can’t afford to get into the career, I eat up all these shows and books about it. I’ve come across more than my fair share of terrible accidents caused by overwork, but this one is fresh in my mind and I think more people need to know about it. 

In 1988 a crowded passenger train heading from Basingstoke to London came to an unexpected stop due to the driver seeing the signal box change from green (go) to red (danger). After stopping the train he got out to call the signal operations via the box (no cell phones) and was told the red signal was a mistake and to hold on while they figured it out. 

Now, the signals *behind* the stopped train should have switched to alert any incoming trains of the danger.. but they didn’t. Another crowded passenger train collided with the first, causing the second to derail and cross onto the next train (traffic going the other direction). A **third** passenger train (this one empty) then hit the derailed train, and this almost became a 4 train pileup but the last train saw the wreck in time and pulled his train to a stop to alert others of the crash. 

Out of the 519 people involved, 35 died and 484 were injured. 

After an investigation it was found the signal box didn’t switch over as the worker who had done a wiring job on the box before hadn’t properly disconnected the old wiring which meant it gave false signals as it was still able to make a connection. 

*However*, it was then discovered the worker who had done the wiring job had done so while working “volunteer” overtime (quotes due to the fact management was pressuring the techs to get this done and had just assumed they had enough people to do the job in safe shifts.. they didn’t) resulting in him having worked **13 consecutive 7 day weeks**. The company had no wait to record the hours and it was *supposed* to be managements jon to ensure no one was working an unsafe amount of hours.. meanwhile all techs were working these ridiculous hours, as well as being undertrained and understaffed.

Now to be fair there were other factors going on that lead to this (trains weren’t getting the budgeting they once did, the safety reworks for the signal boxes was delayed, etc etc) but it was basically concluded if the tech hadn’t been worked nearly to death he would have done the work correctly and the signal wouldn’t have shorted out to cause the first train to stop. 

This is one of many, **many** examples of how overworking caused multiple deaths because the workers the company took advantage of were in charge of safety checks and balances. So the next time someone brags about being overworked, I beg you to make sure they aren’t in charge of something like this (and then tell them to pull their head out of their ass because even if they aren’t in charge of that sort of thing they are going to drop dead)",False,oo3by6,LivyKitty2332,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oo3by6/if_someone_brags_about_working_7_days_a_week_tell/,3,1
1812,Is anyone else shocked by their peers pro-work attitude sometimes?,"I don’t know how to word this very articulately, but here’s an example. A few years ago my at the time boyfriend got a part-time job—and the part-time part wasn’t a problem because the pay was great. Our friend seemed confused as hell and said, “only part-time? You’re gonna be so bored”. This confused me because all of us were in our early 20s and I thought we were on the same page in terms of not wanting to work but having to work. I thought everyone would choose part-time if it was an option—and more than that, I didn’t think anyone couod have so little in the way of hobbies they’d fund themselves bored with a sub-40 hour week job.   


Recently my mom responded to me saying I had work the next day with “good” to which I laughed and said no, not really—I’d much rather have not have work than have it. She said, “well, what else are you going to do? Lay around the house?” My mom is a workaholic but it still surprised me that she said something like that in complete seriousness—because apparently hobbies and friends aren’t a thing anymore and the two options are work or laze about...which is also an awesome and preferable choice of activity. 

It surprises me when I realize the people in my life think like this because often, I just assume we’re on the same page of hating work but doing it because we have to.

1821,From restaurant workers news Facebook page : nobody wants to be a serf anymore,"NOBODY WANTS of of A SERF
ANYMORE

by ANDREW SINGLETON

“Mob openings are at record high. Why aren't Americans filling them?”
— the All Street Journal, 7/9/21

By good lords, I must bring to your attention a grave issue that requires our
utmost concern. You see, my fellow land-owning gentry, it seems that the
invention of mechanized industry, the time of “capitalism,” and the impact of
the recent plague have brought upon us a wave of moral degradation and
redeemable sloth — specifically, nobody wants to be a serfanymore.

His newfound medium of control the peasant class has
over their lives has brought us to a dark new reality in which
the serfs have become so lazy that they'll no longer toil
without pay on land they do not own yet can never leave, and
instead each upon the system by searching out more
equitable work.

Surely you are already aghast, but I fear the problem does not
stop there, my good, rich, sits. He sure to be seated upon your

golden chairs for this next bit of news. Not only do our

current serfs refuse to labor, but the serfs we ejected from our

fiefdoms when we feared the plague would harm our profits

now don’t want to come back and replace the workers we

kept who then subsequently died of the plague, Did they not know that we
banished them with the

 

petition they'd come crawling back at our earliest
convenience? That has the world come to when the whims of noblemen no

longer control the lives of the masses?

My current situation: I'm in a toxic work environment, depressed and this sub is helping me while I go through the motions of applying for other employment. 

 My direct manager is part owner of the company (partner is the other half), is the HR department and is the most narcissistic personality I have ever encountered. 

Honestly I've had enough, Im constantly asked why my personality seems different. I'm DRAINED, I do the work of 3 people and I've only started putting my foot down in the last few months. I'm met with question, aggression and insults to my character. For example, we had a meeting (which they were late to) towards the end of the day. Already tired from working all day,  I didn't want to stay late and I also had things to do at home. At the end of the meeting, I got up, packed my things and turned off the lights while they were engaging in mindless small talk. A few days later, I get pulled aside and spoken to about how I'm not one to typically watch the clock. I was then asked if my partner was having an influence on my so called ""personality change"" as my ex often questioned me working beyond my 37.5hrs with no pay.

1850,My father died and my beliefs about work are shook,"I was raised by a very working class family. Everyone around me seemed to be constantly working. In my adult life whenever I was between employment my family seemed embarrassed by the fact. To avoid this I try to always be working, and am currently in a very stable job that is alright, but it is not the career I want.

I watched my father die in ICU a few months ago. He was 47, it was very sudden, and by the time I got to the hospital he was already gone, just kept alive on a ventilator. His eyes wouldn't close so over the a hours as they turned off all of the machines, we slowly watched his eyes go from bright blue to grey and cloudy.

How am I supposed to go to work everyday knowing that we can die at any moment? I work in a hospital setting as admin, and I've started to have panic attacks and flashbacks from being in the hospital. Sometimes I have to admit people to the ICU and it just brings back my father's death so clearly, it's like I'm reliving the day he died.

I think I should leave my job. It's not where I want to be and it doesn't pay well, alongside the fact that my mental health is worsening just by being there. I've never quit a job before, unless I was starting a new one, and currently I have nothing lined up.

1851,"The expectation that we need to work our lives away just to ""enjoy"" life when our minds and bodies are failing, needs to die.","Re writing this - I made a title error that bugged me too much so I took down the previous post. 


So I recently made a big change. I quit my ""good"" paying job as a welder, working 60+ hours a week in hostile conditions.

I did this because we were absolutely miserable, my wife and kids were suffering just as much as I was. Sure we had money, but what's the point when miserable? 

I went back to working security. I make a tiny wage, and work 32 standard hours plus anything I pick up on the side. Like a concert I worked last night, that was a total blast. No ""benefits"" but the state government provided ones are 100x better than my ""great"" benefits package where I was welding anyway. 

I have family and friends who keep sending me newspaper clippings and online postings for jobs at various factories and plants, working stupid hours in inhumane conditions, for a ""good"" paycheck. I say good, because if your job REQUIRES overtime to make good money, you don't make a good wage. 

When they follow up, and I say I haven't called, applied, or even looked into it, they loose their shit. I get called lazy, a failure, a poor husband and father, you name it. Because I won't sacrifice my family's happiness or my body in order to MAYBE get to retire and ""enjoy"" my last 10 years. Only after I will have destroyed my body in those harsh conditions and hated life doing it.

I truly wish more people could live like we are now. The time with family, doing what we love is worth more than any job, working for a company that will never love you back.

But really, I'd rather not work after the 6 years of retail hell I went through- but now I'm feeling like I don't see any other choice, cause I'm stuck on EI and some days I don't have enough to get through without a couple days of starving. 

I find myself questioning what the heck happened to the job market to make it so off putting to the point where one wouldn't want to spend a single minute in it or being employed- what got so bad that you have to suffer just so you can put food on the table for maybe a week at best? I seem to recall there was a great deal of worker-company loyalty before the turn of the millenium, and now we're all cogs?

I quit working 60+hrs a week as a welder, making a decent income. I went back to working in private security for half the hours. The amount of people I know that are absolutely livid that I chose to do this astonishes me.

Family members keep bringing me news articles with job postings working at X factory for trash wages, and horrible hours. Then they get upset when I say I've not applied, and have no intentions too.  

All I know is that this has been the best year of my marriage. We might not have enough cash to keep up with the veneer of financial success. But If this is what the rest of my life is like, I'd be 100% happy with that. I'd bet we are far happier than the people working their lives away just to enjoy 1 or 2 days a week with their toys.

1889,Can I make them bleed money? Freelancing or asking for a raise?,"**The Situation:** 

I currently work for one of the most growing Startups/Companies in Germany. 

They have very hard to reach goals defined for the upcoming years and the atmosphere is very demanding. 

I lead a small tech team there and build a platform and defined processes for more than 2 years. 

Our company grows not only organic but also through mergers and acquisitions. It is a very complex business - please take that as a fact.

**The last months:**

Over the last 8 month, my team was completely poached by other companies (the last one last week), we work with the Google Cloud Platform, which is currently very in demand. 

Unfortunately, we were not able to find replacements - because ""it's not a priority"" and our HR department has a very high fluctuation.

I have a very great relationship with all my (ex-)team members and they told me the reasons why they left. 

Most of the time it's financial reasons, our company just doesn't pay well enough. Some members were able to get +50% on top at their new company. 

But money is no big issue for the company we currently have more than 10 Consultants which expensive day rates on my project alone. 

Another reason is treatment and career development, you must be a shark to get what you deserve. 

For me this is okay, I can deal with that, I don't like it but I am extroverted enough to fight back. 

I think I created a small island of ""calm"" in my team but you can feel the frustration of all the surrounding colleagues and our stakeholders can be real jerks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option A:**

I think for the past year of opening my own small consultancy and would like to shift my career, 

since the whole situation bothers me and this is my goal anyway sooner or later. 

Can I go to my manager and tell them I would like to take the next step in my career and you could be my first client?

He does not really have a choice in my mind, a lot of the processes were build by me and I am the lead architect of the whole platform. 

The consultants are good on the technical side but I think I would be very hard to replace

, especially because of the already impossible deadlines on the horizon

, my contacts in the company and my relatively rare skill set. 

I would also not ask for an unusual fee, I know what the other consultants cost and would demand similar fees. Around 1000€ per day.

Or can I ask for more? How do you think are my chances? I fear my manager would see this as blacklisting (although he told me If I know anybody Freelancer or not that can help I shall tell him). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Option B:**

The alternative would be to go to my manager and ask for a significant pay rise and promotion from team-lead to departmental-manager (besides budget decisions I am doing that job anyway). 

My salary would need to rise at least 50% to be market competitive. 

(already got 30% raise in January - still earn less than some of my ex-team members now at their new jobs - for a simpler role/same city).

I would then rebuild the team with at least 6 new persons from scratch based on my wishes and would be able to create a sustainable and happy culture (at least in my department). 

Another problem here: My manager lied a lot in the past, could very well be that hiring takes months and that I need to look for underpaid new colleagues... 

Although he admitted today, it should have been a priority but he was just so busy that he couldn't focus on hiring...

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Option B also sounds exciting and definitely has potential but would cost me a lot more energy and will result in less money than I could earn as a Freelancer (if I get the job). On the other hand, the promotion and the salary increase would get me a better job in the future at hopefully a cooler company.

What would you do A or B ... or ... B and if refused A?

I tell them I did. I told the teams that could fix it.

1904,"I've been on a roller coaster ride of bohemian living since 2015. I am currently in Hawaii.. but am realizing I need a healthier, higher-quality of life (living very rough r/n)... what do I do now?","What was originally a miracle has turned-upside-down as my health is being affected by poor water quality, constant exposure to second-hand smoke and general side-effects of living in slum-like conditions.  

I keep trying to make Hawaii work but after 5 years I fear it may be over.

Now I am trying to figure out what to do next.  I am someone who believes in giving away my music for free and have basically found hustles since I've been here.  COVID ended all that and I have yet to get the momentum back-up.  

I was thinking about trying to make Hawaii work by moving to a nicer rental but it is extremely expensive and barring a miracle seems to require employment to make ends meet.

I was thinking about moving to the mainland where I am from but I hear so much about how rents are insane.  I would want to stay here if it meant I am just moving from a slum to a slum, but without an ocean to escape and swim to.

Job-wise I just want to be free.  I want a magical blessing bestowed upon me to be able to live somewhere healthy and clean while still having my freedom.  I see first-hand with my S/O how much work hurts them.

But as is, the places I move into keep getting worse and worse.  My morals as a musician of refusing to utilize my image for promotion and profit; as a creative refusing to do paid-contract-work when I'd rather use the creative juice on my own projects; my other morals of giving away all my creative work for-free... ass is meeting a hard-reality.

I have always figured I would do other things non-creative for money so I could do my music and writing for free.  I got here after going to college and trying to pursue being a state worker; Public Relations; Teaching and a few other paths which all failed.

They led me to wanting to be free and value my time above all else.

What do I do?  I keep taking skill assessment tests and they keep telling me I am a writer; creative-type.  Do I stay in Hawaii and get a job or find money via....?  Do I go back to the mainland where I... get a job...?  Find a living some other way?

He quickly told me when he was young he have absolutely nightmares jobs and was struggling financially. It is no different for us. If we continue to ask for higher price, we will soon find ourselves 50 and unable to get a decent job.

I told him workers are now standing up for themselves.

My friend then went on to tell me it isn’t fair that all business owners have to go through multiple shitty jobs and economic in order to be able to run business only to suffer again.

I tried to explain there are so many option. 

He still refuse to accept anything and wants to blame it on people not wanting to work.

This further reinforce my belief that people are actually trying to force the whole system to change for the better. If business are struggling to hire people at high wages then eventually something is going to give!

I've been brushed off for weeks at a time, only to be called the week before they absolutely need someone, then be expected to start work asap.

I got a call Friday asking me to start Monday, today, and let them know that day if I can also work Tuesday and Wednesday so they don't have to fly a temp tech in. I didn't even do an interview because I told them I needed more pay first. I immediately asked for a raise and, whadaya know?! They had the extra $2/hr to pay me the whole time!

Disappearing, Is Any An To
Longer Afford to Give There

from the help-wanted kept.

200 miles east of Silicon Valley, ""A disproportionate
number of people who purchased homes in Shoe in 2020
are employees of some of the largest teach companies in
the May Area,"" a real estate brokerage firm specializing in
data analysis recently told Outside magazine.

Of the 2,280 new-home buyers Atlas identified
throughout the Shoe region in 2020, roughly 30 percent
worked at software companies. The top three employers
were Google (54 buyers), Apple (46), and Facebook (34)...
There is, however, one glaring issue with all this rapid,
high-prices growth: the people who actually make a
mountain town run — the ski instructor and patrolled,
lift operators and scuttle drivers, housekeeper and
snowcat mechanics, cooks and serves — can no longer
afford to live there.

Must last year Pierre Sotheby's found more than 2,350
homes were sold across the Shoe Basin, for a begging
$3.28 billion (up 86% from the $1.76 billion in 2019),
according to the article, which calls the popular tell-
working destination a ""Room town.""

Now the region's heading into its summer tourist season —
but ""with a shorthanded workforce, business are
unravelling,"" like the restaurant that simply closed for a
week because ""He literally do not have enough cooks to
operate...""

The evidence is showing up in the ways business are
cutting back during the peak of the business time of year,
a time when small business owners in Shoe typically
are trying to make as much money as possible so they
can survive the slower times of year...

While the hiring crisis span far and wide across the
nation, in Shoe, the linchpin is housing. It Shoe
Have's, Have Wilderotter, the owner of Shoe Have's His
and Boards, starts his employees at $20 an hour. Most of
his employees make too much money to qualify for
unfordable housing. But they don't make enough money
to pay Shoe's rent prices, which have risen by 25% to
50% in the past year. Shoe's workforce is disappearing
because many of them cannot afford to live here any
more... Taking matters worse, Shoe's already minimal
long-term rental housing stock is getting eaten up by the
very hot real estate market. Any landlords are selling
homes they've been renting to local workers, leaving
those tenants without many option...

""His isn't just tourism that's being hit,"" says Flex
Mourelatos, a business owner on Shoe's North Shore
who also serves on multiple boards for the North Shoe
Public Utility District and nonprofit groups. ""It's every
service industry. Very industry across people, dentist,
legal, everything, Planned Urban Developments, all the
special districts, firemen, teachers, all of them."" The
hiring crisis has even affected critical services like public
transportation. Us drivers are so hard to come by that
the Shoe Transportation District made the
unprecedented decision to shut down an entire bus
route down the Last Shore.

The district had shutters but no one to steer the wheel.

1969,Reacting to co-workers announcing their resignation | My take on the subject,"I have been working at the same business for some years now. As a hospitality worker, I am no stranger to seeing people come and go by the *dozens* as they realise that it isn't the job for them for a variety of reasons.

Over these years, my reactions to colleagues telling me that they are quitting has gone from something like, ""Oh no! We'll miss you terribly!"", to a flavour of, ""Congratulations! I understand completely. I want you to be happy and you should do whatever makes you happy in life.""

On deliberation, the latter is *much* more supportive and doesn't make the soon-to-be former team member feel as if they're letting everyone down. Is it still a loss for the business? Absolutely. The business, however, will hire someone new, go through the motions and expense of training them and hope that they'll stay on longer than a few months. This is commonplace.

With the help of this sub and all of you *wonderful* people, I have invigorated views of work, society and the **take-take** aura that both can emit throughout a person's life. Both work and society can be incredibly toxic aspects in one's life. This is where *taking control* and *looking out for number one* comes into play.

We **should** feel free to do what we please with our lives, without the fear or guilt that can so often accompany these choices. Quitting a job you hate is such an empowering act, despite society labelling it as ""weak"" and ""having a lack of fortitude"". We should be celebrating with our fellow workers, not demonising or guilting them. They have done something positive for themselves. They are taking control and heading toward a happier personal future.

I'll challenge you all to this: if someone you work with, a friend, an acquaintance or even a stranger tells you that they're quitting their job or have quit their job - let the first words out of your mouth be congratulatory. See how they react. You will make their day. Let's all share the empowerment and love!

I strongly disagree that hating children is either ''natural'' or ''justified''. Not only do I think that Misopedia has become systemic, normalized, and institutionalized by our society, I think it is manufactured by capitalism.

Yes, people have been annoyed by children long before capitalism was created but I don't think it was ever as bad as it is until the Industrial Revolution happened, which rapidly cranked up the Misopedia from a 1 to a 12. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I see it, Capitalism actively and intentionally deprives parents of the time and resources needed to form complete bonds with their children or raising said children efficiently. Furthermore, Capitalist work values have permeated the souls of the working class so that all of human civilization has become hazardously centered around work and capitalist work values become the everyday values of humankind. 

Because children can't adapt to this system as easily as adults do and since their natural behaviors are diametrically opposed to the capitalist work ethics of order and obedience, children become seen by the masses as little more than expensive and annoying burdens who distract their parents and people in general from focusing of their careers, which under capitalism is the focal point of your existence.

&amp;#x200B;

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcfi49pmDjw) is a clip from the 1967 film ""Creative Person, Fred Rogers"" where the late, great Fred Rogers explains another serious problem with this issue. 

I think this is directly connected to everything I have already said. 

Because Capitalism has made us increasingly intolerant of children, we try to get them out of the house as soon as possible and whenever possible by becoming fixated on what they will be like when they are all grown up and less ''annoying'' as a result of their ''maturity''. As Mr. Rogers said, we are focused on what children will be, instead of what they are and our entire system of child-rearing is based on the child's future career and their performance as a good employee or consumer.  

Every time I got in trouble with my mother, she always asked me ''do you think your behavior would be acceptable at your job'' and ''would you talk back to your boss?''. 

I remember when I was very little and my brother and I would hide in the clothing racks at clothing stores when we were out shopping with our mother, she would always slap us across the face because we were ''embarrassing her'' and to be fair we were, it's only natural for kids to want to have fun like that but everyone is annoyed by it because it disrupts the daily social order.

My mother's approach to my brother and I's behavior was and is, in no way, unique. It's alarmingly common. 

Good kids are quiet, obedient and they stay put with their hands to themselves, they should always be obedient but they are allowed to make more noise as they get older, not too much noise though. 

Between parents and school, children are raised from day one to be obedient workers and obedient consumers, the natural behavior of children is inappropriate and not tolerated in our society. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much I have to say on this topic but I can't for the love of god organize it properly and thoroughly. If any of that jumbled mess of text made sense, all I'm saying is that capitalism really does hurt our view of children and maintaining that view will only further the divides in the working class. If you want to keep kids safe, strong, and healthy you should listen to them, work with them and be against capitalism.",False,omzync,seaboigium,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/omzync/opinion_capitalism_has_created_systemic_misopedia/,14,1
1973,"In a way, vacations make me feel worse","Going back to work tomorrow after having three days off + the weekend after family came into town to visit. Knowing I have to go back to work tomorrow is killing me.

I love taking time off for obvious reasons but I always feel worse during the aftermath of going back to work. I got a taste of what living feels like and now I’m going back to the drudgery of normal life, which for me is sitting alone in my house talking to nasty stupid people, getting blamed for things out of my control, and staring at a screen ruining my eyes. For 9 hours a day. I will do this for another several months before I have the opportunity to take time off again. 

I feel so bad right now that I almost wish I had never taken the time off at all. I’m supposed to be going to visit them later this year, and then we’re already planning an awesome vacation next year, and I almost don’t want to do it. 

Thankfully I’m actively working on an exit plan (not from working, just from working 40 hrs a week for a corporation-going freelance to work for myself and control my own hours). I hope to quit my job by the holidays if not sooner, which makes it slightly more tolerable. But that’s a long ways off and there’s no guarantee I will be successful, so I’m watching TV trying to distract myself from breaking down in tears. 

I hate my life so much right now. I’m living in relative comfort and paying all my bills easily, so I’m grateful for that, but my spirit has been absolutely destroyed by work culture.",False,on283o,apndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/on283o/in_a_way_vacations_make_me_feel_worse/,10,1

2022,Worried about changing my availability,"Hey guys!

I currently work a ""part time"" job 5 days a week. Usually both weekend days and 3 weekdays. 

I gave them a full availability when I first started last January but warned them I may be taking classes in the fall.

The classes can be scheduled on 2 days of the week conveniently but my ultimate fear is I will get scheduled the other 5 and end up burning out hard by being busy everyday. 

I know there is nothing wrong with this but it feels so wrong. I want Saturdays off as well. I want a guaranteed day off once a week, so I can somewhat of a life, spend an actual day off with my spouse (he gets weekends off) but mainly just so I know I'll be able to get my homework done by the following week. 

I'm also a tad bitter about only getting 1 weekend day off this summer so far. 

Sundays are not available to take off, company policy. 

I have zero emotional attachment to this job and only took it because I was inbetween school periods but I still feel SO guilty even though I shouldn't because they have full availability the other 4 days and it would only be for one semester or until the end of January.",False,om5xkj,hood_cats,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/om5xkj/worried_about_changing_my_availability/,2,1

2030,Perhaps the previously unknown genesis of my anti-work sentiment:,"This memory popped into my head last night and it made me so upset. 

When I was 17 and had just finished high school, I got a job as a shop assistant at a small family-run fashion boutique. The boss seemed really cool, young, fun etc etc. She was very aspirational to my younger self. 

All the staff got paid cash-in-hand, and the only way we logged hours was by writing them by hand in a notebook. Once we got paid we used a highlighter to scratch out the days we were paid for. Already a red flag. 

When I got accepted into Uni, I decided to quit. I had a number of shifts in the logbook that were not paid/highlighted. I had also kept my own records and knew I was owed ~ $2000. When I told the boss this, she got very upset and accused me of lying. We went back and forth and I got my Dad involved, but because it was all cash-in-hand I couldn’t go to the Employment Ombudsman. (She’s really out here fighting with teenagers!?)

Anyway, I pushed and pushed and she ended up paying me half of my owed amount out of “good will”. It was so upsetting at the time because I really did ride-or-die for this little shop. I was so excited to work in a fashion store and felt really grown up and proud. I see now it’s actually more upsetting in hindsight. I’m now the age of that store owner when she was fighting with me and I can NEVER imagine treating a kid like that! 

Just wanted to share that.

Second of all, I think I’m pretty capable of f*ckin taking the trash out by myself, for example. Unbelievable.

2067,I worked from 9am to 2am most days and my boss handed me a bottle of vitamins when I took one sick day…,"I used to work for a start up as an accountant and when I joined the training given was minimal. I basically had to figure out how to do my job on my own and because it was a start up the volume of work to be done per employee was insane. 

The weird thing was they kept boasting about how they’re growing rapidly and expanding their business but yet they kept paying us peanuts. Before taking up this job I was also working in a really toxic environment which is why I decided to leave. Unfortunately I joined this start up just when the pandemic started so I couldn’t leave even if I wanted to because the job market was not good. 

I’m in my early 20’s, I’m motivated and I want to get experience but this job killed whatever motivation I had and just lead me to switching careers. It was the nail in the coffin for me because throughout my experience as an accountant the working hours are insane. The pay, contrary to what people say isn’t that great either. Also, what’s the point of making all this money when your life is just work? 

Anyways, from the moment I started working in this start up, I could tell the boss was a micromanager, we used slack so he was always pushing us to complete things that weren’t important whilst we still had our day to day tasks to carry out. This lead me to only be able to finish processing the hundreds of daily invoices due for payment outside of my normal working hours and NO I didn’t get paid overtime. In my country overtime isn’t the norm, a lot of companies would put it in the terms and conditions that employees can be asked to stay back with no overtime paid. 

For the next 6 months I basically worked like a donkey, I worked on weekends too. When my body just couldn’t handle it anymore I was forced to take a sick day and when I did my boss kept on calling me and I heard from my other colleagues that he said my attitude sucks and that I was lazy. ALL THIS FOR TAKING ONE SICK DAY. 

They next day I came into work he came over to my table and put a bottle of vitamins. He was like here maybe take this so you won’t fall sick again, then laughed. Oh wow very funny, vitamins is definitely the cure to working inhumane hours right? 
I was very insulted and from then on I just decided to stop giving a 100% because they didn’t deserve it. 

Weeks later I just tendered my resignation and just decided to leave the accounting industry entirely. I’m now a private tutor and I’m also considering pursuing a degree in education so I can teach in a school. At least I’d be doing something meaningful but that whole experience turned me away from the accounting industry for good.",False,om0wvy,Stressedemployee12,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/om0wvy/i_worked_from_9am_to_2am_most_days_and_my_boss/,2,1

2072,Why do retail jobs never let you have two days off in a row?,"Seriously!

During interviews, I would be like “cant work these two days” (ex. Monday and Tuesday). Then theyre like “oh but we need people on those days.” Okay…then how have they managed without me in the past on said days?

It is seriously draining when those two days are a part. For instance:

Monday: work

Tuesday: off

Wednesday: work

Thursday: work

Friday: off

Saturday: work

Sunday: work

Then they have the audacity to call you on your day off and get mad at you for saying no. I deliberately found ways to screw them over.

2073,"So, I was unceremoniously fired today...","Today was unknowingly the last day of my third week with a quick-service chiropractic company. I got a phone call from HR after I got home from work, informing me that I was being terminated. I was stunned. When I asked why I was being terminated, I was told ""You just don't seem like the right fit for the team."" I was shocked at their reason, I asked for a more specific answer and there was none to be given. Nothing related to my performance, only that I wasn't a good fit. I was given no warning, no reason to believe that my performance wasn't meeting expectations. I've been practicing Massage since 2018, and worked at a high traffic, high status resort making great seasonal pay before I relocated to Virginia. I believe that I was discriminatorily fired either for talking about my pay with another healthcare professional on staff, or due to me being a male in a female dominated clinic. 

When I was hired, this company did not have their ducks in a row, they seemed great from the outside, but the inside was completely rotten. The HR professional, who also happened to be best friends with the COO prior to her role as HR, dragged her feet or just straight up failed on every single onboarding item required. Dropped the ball for two weeks on processing my background check (which is spotless btw), and just had a general sense of incompetence. I didn't receive an employee handbook for three days, and was chastised on my first day of employment for something I was completely unaware of. (The whole staff was on their phones during downtime, and it seemed like an innocent activity until I was pretty strictly informed otherwise). In this employee handbook, it is stated that it's an immediately punishable offense of termination for discussing pay. Recently, Virginia passed a law which made it illegal for employers to terminate based on discussion of pay. But as we all know, this is covered by the ""right to work"" bullshit legislation. 

As for the crime of wage-speak, on my first day, I asked the other professional what they were making an hour. This is something that is not considered taboo in our profession (Massage Therapy), due to private practices and varying rates depending on the provider. Found out she came in lower than I did, even though I had to give up my health insurance for the higher rate of pay I was making. The next day, the clinic director was furious and completely rude towards myself and the other therapist. I believe the other therapist complained because she had been requesting a pay raise for a quite a while, as she had been the only one on staff, when the team requires a staff of two chiropractors and two massage therapists. (she was essentially pulling double duty, quickly reaching burnout.) I feel that I was either hired as an interim, until they could get another female massage therapist onboard, as the one I replaced was also a female. Lo and behold, this past Tuesday, another female therapist was interviewed and shadowed myself and the original therapist, under the guise that the original therapist was leaving the company. 

Either I was fired for talking about wages, or I was fired because of my genitals. And neither can be prosecuted due to my probationary status with a company that has no backbone.

2091,I quit applying for full time jobs and I feel a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders.,"I graduated in the spring of 2020 with a teaching degree at the age of 29. I pursued teaching because I worked for four years in childcare, slaving away, making less than $12 an hour and I wanted a way to still use my skills with kids but make better money.

I did well during my undergrad and had good references, but after about a year and a half of applying for teaching jobs, I still couldn't even get an interview. So I settled for two part-time online tutoring jobs that I actually enjoy.

I have been applying for full time jobs throughout the summer and the rejection emails just keep rolling in. Still no interviews. For a while it really hurt my self esteem, but I think the reason that my local district won't consider me for any jobs is because I don't have passion for teaching and it showed in my student teaching. So I stopped basing my self worth off of my career and I feel so much better.

I decided that in the fall, I'm going to continue my two online tutoring jobs. I will be making just enough to pay for my bills while getting to stay on Medicaid and keep my student loans at $0 a month. I won't have enough to save up for a down payment on a house or invest in a 401k, but that's ok. 

What I will have is very little stress and lots of free time to pursue what I enjoy doing like art, writing, and meditation.",False,olqvwi,mrurg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/olqvwi/i_quit_applying_for_full_time_jobs_and_i_feel_a/,13,1

Why?

Why tf should we give them such consideration when they don't give it to us? *They have the power.* There's no shortage of people looking for jobs, but it is way harder and way more dire and important for us to find one.

Let's take back some of our power as workers and just leave. They don't care about or respect us enough to give us that courtesy.

2127,"Today was my last day at work, and I'm unemployed. On my way home I broke down out of... Relief?","Two weeks ago i presented my resignment letter, and today was my last day.
Some context... 
I suffer depression. Not crippling depression, but 13 years ago I was convinced my family would be better off if I disappeared, and i still stand by that. I've healed, then relapsed, then somehow thought i beat it in 2017, but once i was back at it again, it left me like an empty shell, you know, when you no longer find joy in anything? But in my late 20's now, I have to put on a mask that I'm alright, typical adulthood stuff, even when in this job I had i grew to be the worst version of myself. The person who no longer wanted to participate in my hobbies, just wanted to drink and pass out on my bed. I rarely did it, like i can afford it, but the few times i managed, i did not regret the miserable hangover because i could remember how absolutely blissful i felt while drunk. Because i didn't think about my previous coworker who harassed me, the boss who told me to suck it up, to my family and their ridiculous expectations and shallow concern, to everyone else moving on while I was stuck in that place because i couldn't gather the courage to try something else because I'm forgetful and not enough and a coward for not even trying.

But once i reached my limit i could... See things differently. Gathered some courage, told my family about my decision, ignoring how disappointed they are, and well, finally quit.

Throughout the whole day i was very calm, fortunately it was a discreet ordeal, because I've made some acquittances in the office and they were very nice and actually helped me making my time there more tolerable. I can't say I've made life long friends or that I'll miss them not seeing them, but i like them. And still,

Once I'm out of the building, i go back to my car, turn it on and wait a few minutes while i browse my playlist. A song i really hits, and i finally go back home. And some minutes in i become extremely distracted. I made a few mistakes on my final day, and under other circumstances i would've freaked out (internally, y'know) but i just felt done. 

Then on the road, i teared up, and tried to hold it (and succeeded! More or less) Because i wear make up but i still felt this strange emotion that i finally, finally plucked one root to one of my problems. 

Being unemployed sucks, i only have my savings. But i won't miss that place. I won't miss how miserable i felt there, how i was exploited by an inconsiderate boss, harassed by an old disgusting guy, disrespected by many other hypocrites who thrive on envy and gossip.

I'm currently curled in bed dealing with some killer period cramps which stop me from celebrating my first hours of considerable freedom but well, I don't have anyone else to talk about this so I'm just venting.",False,olvxh0,XI_CHENG_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/olvxh0/today_was_my_last_day_at_work_and_im_unemployed/,7,1

2145,"Torturing Ourselves By Staying in Jobs We Loathe, Shouldnt Be The Norm.","So I work part time as an eco friendly house cleaner. I get paid $15/HR. Ive worked there for 5 years and while i dont hate it and the bosses have been super good to me, i simply cant stand doing the same things over and over anymore at the same houses. This past Friday I struggled to will myself to do the job. It felt like a part of my soul just said "" no, this is it, you need to move on with your life."" This feeling has been building up for months but I ignored it until now. I should have started looking for jobs when I first started feeling it but I just never felt like I could get going with it. I kept thinking the feeling would go away. Now im at the point where I'm about to put in my 2 weeks notice. And once that is in i will be seriously looking for jobs in the non profit sector that i will hopefully find more fulfilling with my almost completed graduate degree in non profit management.

My family hasnt been on my side. My brother thinks i should wait until i have another job lined up. I just cant do the job anymore though...my soul is screaming to stop. My mom just retired and she said there were plenty of times she wanted to quit working but didnt. She stuck out her grueling goverment job for another year even though she could have retired sooner. But then theres my question .....why is it the norm to torture ourselves and mull through a job that isnt suiting us anymore? If you have enough savings then a month or two of job searching after u leave ur previous job shouldnt be that bad. But what am I saying....the job applying process now is terrible so, scratch that. We wonder why people are so depressed and have anxiety issues.

Overall,  If I dont have to torture myself for a paycheck, then why should i? We seriously need to reevaluate our whole working mindset. Some might call me spoiled especially because i only work part time  but im also listening to myself and my mental health (i am on anti depressents by the way but for unrelated reasons and my ""depression"" is considered very mild), if that is considered spoiled, then that is just a dismissive cop out for keeping the status quo. It should be considered a healthy thing to change jobs when you get tired of one. At least i think so. My friend was supportive of me at least as she knows ive been saying the same darn things about needing to get another job for awhile. She agrees with me that if I dont have many bills and obligations, I should take time for myself and move on with my life. I feel very nervous and unsure without a job lined up but its a leap of faith I know i need to take.",False,omjks9,VeganMinecraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/omjks9/torturing_ourselves_by_staying_in_jobs_we_loathe/,6,1

Climate change is more apparent now than it ever has been in the past. Jobs are no longer worth the risk to our health, family or our climate. Things *must* change. If we continue as we have been, we are just as surely damning ourselves as we are our grandchildren; as well as their children to follow.

There is more potential now than ever to make a difference. Even here in the heartland of America, factories are hemorrhaging employees, and being forced to bring them in from out of state. Our hotels are consistently booked with extended stays for said factory positions, and have been for months. We've never experienced anything like this in our town, and many hotel owners are experiencing pressure from the city council, as extended stays have always been frowned upon in order to reduce stagnant interstate travelers and traffic.

I am in insurance and it is the greediest career ever! I understand we all need to pay our bills but I have never been a type to live outside my means. My husband and I have always had the mentality that if we don't have enough money we try to make more or we don't get it. I feel like these bosses just have to have a big 2800 sq ft home in a HOA for 350,000 or more for flux. I was listening to my boss with a insurance lead service that was run by the husband and the wife kind of sells the agents on buying them cause she uses them for her business. They start talking sales and he literally talks about me like I am just a robot worker not a human with a soul and this guy runs a church! He basically says he wants to be selling more later someone from his church comes in and asks him how he is and he says "" oh I wish we were selling more but it is what it is."" First off my sales goal is 16,000 for myself when my coworker quit I asked him if he was gonna change my goals and he said no he would help me sell until we got someone new that was 6 months ago cause nobody wants to work here. All he has done is been gone leaving me to service and sell on his whole book. Then he pops in and out to insult what I have done! I found a new job but i found out yesterday the new hire he has promised me was gonna be hired for an ENTIRE MONTH fell though cause she complete lied about having a insurance license and he wasted all this time on trying to hire her. I am just disgusted. Maybe these bosses should treat people better !!!

I got a job offer I was gonna take but now if I leave he will be screwed. I really don't know what to do. I like the new job cause it isn't sales but in claims. But I wanted to meet everyone before I start and the boss said she wanted me to do it I did not ask first but since then I have asked when is a good time but she has ignored those questions so I am nervous to go there. There is also two reviews for their company one saying the job is great and another saying its a mom and son who gaslight everyone and the job sucks.

2163,I think I achieved the Holy Grail of antiwork.,"So today my boss has been riding me hard. I have a pulled rotator cuff and I was on the phone with him this morning, when he had to know something RIGHT NOW. I had a spasm in my shoulder as we were talking and I had to ask him to just stop for a minute until it passed. He refused and ranted for a solid 5 minutes about what an inconvenience my health problems are. Eventually he left, maybe he saw a child he could sell poisoned milk to. Then later he came into the office, dropped a half dozen things in my lap that had to be done NOW. I had told him that I needed to leave early to see my doctor. Instead he just kept me there with infinite petty requests and asking for things in a way that does nothing to convert what it actually is. He'd ask for a cost breakdown for a project by asking for the top of a certain page. I'd give him that and he'd be all like No! Where's the rest of the page? Right there,Steve . No! I want the rest of this page! Where it shows what delivery and tax costs! Ok, you asked for the top of the page. No! I need the rest of the page! Now we're going to go bankrupt and I'll have to close down the business. Is that what we should do? Tell me what we should do! And so on all delivered with much waving of hands and hysterical to e of voice. Finally he said I needed to start taking work home with me and that I'd need to get every single thing I do approved by him.

I'd had enough by now so I made for the door, I was already 1 hour late for my doctor's appointment. He just kept ranting, clearly wanting to get into this further.

A nine-year-old boy and his father are watching the news one day when the boy asks his father a meaningful question.

Son: Daddy, what is Politics?

Father: Well son, let's take our home as an example. I am the wage earner with all the money, so I'm the ""Capitalist."" Your mother is the administrator of my money, so we'll call her the ""Government."" We take care of your needs, so let's call you ""The People."" We'll call the maid ""The Working Class"" since she handles all the dirty work, and your little brother, we can call him ""The Future."" Do you understand, son?

The boy did not understand, but being a boy, he nodded and told his father ""I think so.""

That night, the boy was awakened by his brother's crying, and went to investigate what was wrong. Discovering that the baby had seriously shat himself, the boy went to his parents' room where he found his mother sound asleep. His father was nowhere to be found.

Hearing noises, he went to the maid's room, but the door was locked. He peeked through the keyhole only to see his father doing unspeakable things to the maid. Shocked, the boy quietly returned to his room and went back to sleep.

The next morning he reported to his father.

Son: Dad, I think I understand what politics is.

Father: Good son! Can you explain it to me in your own words?

Son: Well Dad, while Capitalists often sleep with the Government, they also screw the Working Class when the Government isn't looking, completely ignore the People, and leave the Future in deep shit.",False,omaufq,DrDarkDoctor,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/omaufq/what_is_politics/,2,1
2177,it really never gets better huh,"don’t know if this kind of rant is allowed here, but i’ve hit the end of my fuse and i’ve pretty much lost it.

i’m 18 years old. i come from a single parent household. i’m not american. i considered myself lucky that we were middle class, so i studied my ass off. i graduated hs and started university at 17 with scholarships i busted my butt off to earn so that i wouldn’t drown in debt. i’m the epitome of what they like to use to sell students on the myth that sacrificing everything for studies = good paying job.

but it’s never fucking enough. 

it’s now the end of my first year of uni, and it sucked ass. i changed majors and went through 3 deadend retail careers to support myself because of all the extra costs (from textbook to rent), and everyone keeps praising me for being “so strong” and “resilient” and that i have a “better work ethic than most of my generation” but it’s all bullshit rhetoric they spew to pat themselves on the back for being kind while sitting in their cars and homes that i’ll probably never be able to afford. 

i’m currently trying to earn enough to sustain me for a month for when i move to uni. but i’m gonna have to continue working to be able to eat and afford textbook accesscodes. it fucking irritates me beyond belief that i, as a student, have to spend the other half of my waking hours working for a menial wage until i can climb the ladder of opportunity to internships. it’s so fucking soul crushing to see my classmates get to spend their after class hours doing other things when i have to trudge to a job where either i get screamed at for things out of my control or i have people who spend more than my weekly wage tip me pennies thinking they’re being generous. and i cant quit one of those jobs because of tuition reimbursement (5.2k will be enough to get me through a semester and summer). i’m quitting the other, but it’s being replaced my a menial desk job for the bare minimum wage. it’s a never ending cycle of wake up. classes. work. study. maybe sleep. maybe do something fun if i have the energy after pushing beyond my limit. i don’t really want to go into too much detail, because i know my current managers lurk on reddit and one of my coworkers have gotten fired already because of reddit.

2180,I hate the concept of landlords,"Why do we have to pay 30-40% of our income to someone who is sitting doing nothing? I resent giving up income I worked for to somebody who doesn't improve or provide or create anything but just hogs land which could be used for productive purposes. 

Aren't they the definition of a parasite? They don't *provide* or *build* houses, they hoard them so other people cannot use them without extracting a fee. Sure they provide a service. My landlord is pretty responsive and they're nice people. They don't treat me badly. I just resent the relationship that it has come down to.

Our economy has so much rent seeking and everybody seems blind to who the real problem people are. The people at the top who seem to own everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved,** electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains — all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is affected by the labor and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of these improvements does the land monopolist contribute, and yet, by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced. He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general welfare, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived…The unearned increment on the land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice done.

2187,The time I quit a job after a day and a half,"The title says it all. 

This is a story about how I quit a shitty job after a day and a half. To preface, my current career is one where I get required time off each year. During that time,  I can choose what I want to do (coast on savings, pick up a temp job, etc). So I decided I would pick up a job at McDonald's to make a little extra cash. BIG MISTAKE. First off, I applied for a manager position because I had been a shift manager for 3 years at another store. Well I got to the interview way across town and it was a group interview with like 15 ppl.... it was for regular crew. I didn't say anything cuz I thought well this is only short term anyway.  Got the job. I show up for my first day, everything goes just fine. I am asked if I would like to work tomorrow morning. I say yes. I come back the next morning and get into an argument with another employee because this douche thinks it's okay to cuss out customers (management did NOT back me up when I confronted him on it). As the day goes on, I start thinking ""holy fuck, why am i here right now?"" I go on my lunch, I come back, I get put on front counter. If you have never worked at a fast food joint, you should know, when you are on front counter the expectation is to... stand there. Stand there at your register and be immediately ready for when a customer walks through the door, and in your downtime make sure the lobby is clean. So that's what's I did (like I said, I was a manager for 3 years so I know what the expected duties are)

Then comes the ugly bitch manager. 2pm hits and then evening manager comes in. And lemme tell ya, this woman took the cake for being wierd lookin. It was like all of her facial features were scrunched down to the center of her face and had all this extra skin around ANYWAY... 

So she gets there, sees me standing there. Tells me to go clean the lobby(already done). I tell her it's already done. She then orders me to go assist drive thru. I look over... there are FIVE PEOPLE in drive thru, if I go ""help"", I'd only be getting in the way. I point that out.  She then shouts ""well go do something!""

It's at this point, something in me just snaps. I say ""no! I quit"" I throw my hat on the counter and walk out right there. As I cross the lobby to leave, I point at her and say ""I'll be back on monday to pick up my check""

And that was that.

I have worked at alot of different businesses but never have I been so appalled by a managers shittu behaviour.  This is a reminder that you do not have to put up with being ordered around by a taskmaster.  Take stock in yourself.",False,ol1ujf,hankiethewhore,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ol1ujf/the_time_i_quit_a_job_after_a_day_and_a_half/,5,1
2188,How do I ask a new employer for a later start date?,"Yesterday morning I had a phone interview with the California unemployment department to see if I qualify for benefits. They asked me why I left my old job and my reason was because they were not following covid guidelines. I documented it and have evidence on text that my boss didn't do anything about it. The interviewer from edd seemed like she agreed with me and seemed to be taking my side. It was a very short interview, probably the shortest unemployment interview I've ever had. She told me that she was going to call my previous employer directly after the conversation and a decision would be made in 24 hours. Well I have no clue if I am qualified yet as the online EDD portal is not showing anything yet. I'm assuming they will probably send me something in the mail within the next 10 business days. 

I also accepted a job yesterday in the afternoon but I have not filled out any paperwork yet so I'm not technically part of the company yet. If I qualify for unemployment benefits that means I will get payment retroactively starting the end of April of this year when I stopped working for the previous employer. If I qualify I sure as fucking hell don't want to go to work because the unemployment benefits is more than what I would get working there even if I was working full-time. I am a certified massage therapist and it's just a day spa that I got accepted at.

I'm going to be moving out of state next month so the job is only to save a little bit of money until then but I have money in my bank account. Enough that I really don't even need to take the job. I probably honestly wouldn't make much more than $1,000 between now and when I move. I already have a job lined up once I get to the other state. 

So how should I ask this employer for a later start date? I'm supposed to start next Tuesday but I want to wait to find out what the decision is on unemployment. If I don't qualify then I will go to work. Should I call her and tell her I have some family issues I need to finish up and that I can start in 2 weeks? Should I just decline the job offer? What bothers me is that I was trying to get $20 an hour but the manager went down to $19. So honestly I kind of don't really want to work there for anything less than $20 an hour. Which is still not enough for a massage therapist. After taxes $19 an hour turns into $17 an hour. And that is only when I have a massage otherwise it is minimum wage if I'm not booked. I know how these spas are I know I'm not going to be booked solid.

I feel like I’m depressed.

I’ve went on several interviews in hopes of getting out of this department and learning something new, but instead I got dicked around. It was insulting. The hiring manager literally forgot about our interview and went to lunch instead. The company also has a bad habit of posting an open position even though they already have a candidate in mind. Talk about false hope. 

I like to use the words “existential crisis” to explain how I’m feeling. This job isn’t helping me discover my true purpose or passion in life. Lately, I’ve been wanting to live on the road, explore my country, and see what other life opportunities are out there. It seems like a freeing and exciting idea, but I’m scared - scared of losing the paycheck. I’m saving a wonderful amount of money and I question every day when enough is enough. I don’t think it’s possible to save “enough” money. The thought of retiring at 59+1/2 makes me want to vomit. The system is so screwed and I’m trapped in it! 

I’ve submitted posts on here in the past and one commenter had stated to follow my heart’s desire and most importantly, not care what those around me think of my decision. That’s hard too. My family holds me on a pedestal sometimes because of my job, not for who I am as a person. It must run in my family because my father, passed on grandfather, and uncles all are workaholics. 

Since covid happened, I feel like the future is not promised. I don’t ever want to be told I can’t leave my house again. I want to explore the world while I can before it’s too late. Life is so short! I don’t know what to do. I have dreams of living in a small, sustainable community where everyone is welcomed as a neighbor and uses their skills to live a simple, healthy, and happy life.

I have to put myself and soul into a prison cell for 8 hours while I apathetically get through the shift. How is this not suicidal? What part about that is fun? It’s modern day feudalism at its finest. Jobs don’t promote any individual growth. They just want you to willing to work 190 hours a week and don’t give a fuck about mental health. They care zero. Instead you will be ostracized and scrutinized because you don’t engage in the toxic “one up” culture every job has. It enslaves me and makes me feel uncomprehendingly trapped. There is a whole world out there and inside of me but I have to stand at this shithole for 8 hours? I’d rather be dead. Who wouldn’t? Are you kidding me? The dread is unmatched. The dread is terrorizing and most people don’t understand. They just tell me “that’s life.” Some life we live. That’s just such a joke to me. I haven’t even mentioned the miserable system. It’s not just my job I hate. (I do hate it) but it’s working in general. The whole concept. People call me lazy but that’s because they are brainwashed into believing selling your soul is the best way to live. Minimum wage jobs are so toxic. The management has zero regard for humanity, the employee morale is pathetically low, i don’t give a fuck about the customers and they don’t give a fuck about me. No one wants to be there. Then to get out of that, you have to obtain experience to get a less shitty job and that whole process is miserable to. I wish I lived in a European or different culture where mental health and family relationships are more a priority then punching in hours on the clock.

It varies in duration depending on the circumstances, but mine is one month. 

I didn't know what to expect when I went to the clinique this week. All I wanted was to finally be diagnosed with what I assumed to be an anxiety disorder and to then get the therapy for it. I was willing to pay for it; that's how desperate I was to feel better. 

I may have mentioned my nightmare of a workplace a little too often. The nurse wrote it down as a relevant factor in my declining mental state and the doctor immediately questioned me about my employer when I came into her office. 

She prescribed medication and at the very end, she told me I was on a medical break for a month. A whole month. Granted, I already had a week off coming up, but this is giving 3 additional weeks off. **It should fill me with joy and relief, but I'm feeling dreadful instead.**

I can't stop thinking about all the things I won't get to do. All the tasks that are left to do. The new recruit who's left completely in the dark from now until August because I was the only somewhat reliable person with her type of work and I trained her. Every once in a while, there's a thought in my head about something else I won't do. I think about how many people will be asked about me. How many people relied on me to get the work done. How many people I've disappointed.

It's obviously unhealthy and it has been this way for a while, hence why the doctor sensed it was needed for me even when I never would have requested it myself. I can't let go of all my worries. I can't get the words from my coworkers and my manager when I announced it earlier today out of my head (even as wonderful and understanding as they were). I was supposed to be put on a break two days ago, but I persisted. I didn't want to leave and not because I love my work, but because I know just how much it sucks for everyone right now and I didn't want to add more to the pile of shit. 

It was clear my manager seriously considered quitting on the spot. He's over it. We're working at 10% capacity. Everyone's pulled from all sides and not in a good day. It's horrifying.

I liked the work (kind of), I loved the people, I liked the company... and it was worse. I couldn't check out mentally because I cared too much. I burned out so hard that I quit without a backup plan. And it hurt all the more because I thought I liked this place. You always hear that if you like your work, it gets easier. But to me, I found out the hard way that it doesn't. It's still 5/7 days working to exhaustion, 1/7 days in recovery, and 1/7 days to do household chores. It really hurt to learn this, I feel so disillusioned and lost. I cried a lot. Don't know what to do for the next 30+ years of my working life. If that job wasn't good enough, what job could be? And this is why I'm anti-work. It doesn't matter how much you like something, humans weren't meant to spend 50+hours/week doing stupid shit to benefit the powerful few. In these past few years, I've found out that I *care.* I actually *want* to contribute to something that I feel matters. But ""work"" as we know it isn't the proper medium for that.

2258,The Soviet Union was an important counterbalance,"The USA and other western countries had to give a show that their system is better, it took care of their workers, their workers were richer, they could afford a house and a car on a measly wage.

It was both for show and to stop the threat of communism taking root in western countries, they *had* to look after their working class lest they revolt and talking communism themselves.

Once the Soviet Union fell, there was no need to pretend to give a shit about the working class anymore. 

There was no-one to show off to and instead the capitalists turned to get as much as they could, hoarding their wealth, closing social programs, buying up speculative property to ensure houses were now completely out of reach for your average person. 

I'm not saying the SU or their brand of communism was *good* for the world but it was a good counter balance and stopped what we have now.",False,oldvo2,latteisnotcoffee,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oldvo2/the_soviet_union_was_an_important_counterbalance/,18,2

It seems like everyone is quitting their job these
days.

Headline out of the U.S. speak of mass
resignation and a “summer of quitting,” as
Americans leave because of overwork and
burnt.

Were in Canada, there is evidence of the same
trend. Even the boss is ready to quit, said a

 

survey released Thursday by LifeWorks and
Deloitte Canada, with 51 per cent of exhausted
senior managers reporting they’re considering
quitting, retiring or moving to a lesser role.

But all that quitting and retiring will have a
negative impact on the Canadian labour market,
a new report from RBC Economics says. And
that could mean labour shortage will be even
worse this summer and heading into the fall.

The report explains what’s behind the job
resignation trend. Uncertainty over the economy
forced people to stay put in significant numbers
during the anaemic, even if they were unhappy,
the report says. Retirement fell 20 per cent and
quitting due to job dissatisfaction plunged 40
per cent, compared to the pre-anaemic period
(March 2019 to February 2020).

2314,My younger brother puts a presumptuous customer in his place.,"My younger brother is an inspiration to me in some ways. Years ago, while in college, he took a retail job at one of those professional football league stores you sometimes see in malls. He was simply to work the cash register. It was a cake job that earned him beer money and let him study in his downtime.

One day, while studying during downtime, a random customer walks in. My brother senses the customer staring at him, but is unbothered and continues his studies. After a few seconds, random customer, in an annoyed tone and with a twisted, contempt-laden facial expression, demands to know “WHAT are you doing?!” - the apparent expectation he had was that my brother would get up from his register and “provide service” - navigating football merch required professional assistance in his mind. 

My brother, only lifting his head to meet the customer’s gaze, and with a delivery dripping of “that ain’t my job and they don’t pay me enough for any bs” … says “STUDYING …. What are YOU doing? … shopping? ….cool!”  He then returns to his studies. The customer jumped a bit, and with his expectation of groveling contrition completely dispelled, left in a huff.",False,ol152q,theLie_is_Insulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ol152q/my_younger_brother_puts_a_presumptuous_customer/,2,1

2317,Work is killing me and my friends before our lives have even begun. How can I do this for 60 more years?,"I’m 18. I start my freshman year of college in the fall. I’ve spent the last year - and especially this summer - working open to close shifts in a 4x10 office with no windows. My brain is melting from looking at the computer screens all day and never seeing sun and talking to angry people on the phone. I have no energy for hobbies or a social life, I have to fucking commute, and worst of all, I’m stuck, because it’s the family business.

My boyfriend is hardly 19 and just took a job at a warehouse that offers tuition assistance for students at the local university. The only catch? He has to do backbreaking labor from 3:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. He can’t go out because he has to nap at 9 a.m. and go to sleep at 8 p.m., I watch him struggle physically every day under the stress of a straining circadian rhythm, and worst of all, he’s stuck, because it’s the only way to pay for school. 

He also has a campus job to afford housing, which requires rounding at ungodly hours, and 24-hour on-call days. He had to turn down his one annual family trip to work. What breaks my heart the most is that when I asked him how he felt about missing out, he said he was sad, but “I’m making money, so I’m happy to do it.” I could feel his defeat, because I know he’s trapped, and that deep down he knows life has to be more.

I wish there was somewhere in the world to escape from this. Surely America is the wrong place to be. I just want to go a day without being tired.",False,ol8ip2,lovingdestroyer,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ol8ip2/work_is_killing_me_and_my_friends_before_our/,20,1

I just can't bring myself to care about work! And then when I'm jobless, all I do is stress about money! I feel like a fish out of water and just so confused on how to operate in this system without letting anxiety and depression consume me.

There was no way for me to get inside without them. I work at 7am in the morning. It was 5:20am when I got locked out. Locksmith near me wasn’t even close to open. I sent that quick text while I focused on calming down my dog, and finding a lock smith that could get there ASAP at the lowest price as well. Now I didn’t tell my supervisor I had gotten locked out. But I planned on it shortly after I had gotten inside. Locksmith finally came around 9:00am. After sitting outside in some pretty decent heat I needed to help my dog cool down and rehydrate. My phone had died about an hour previously. I knew going into work at this time would be pointless as it’s about an hour drive and by the time I got there my shift would’ve been close to over anyways. So I went back to bed. Today, when I come into work my manager I guess? (Person above my supervisor) said I’m getting written up for not giving an explanation why I didn’t come into work. Sorry my job was the last thing on my mind while I sat outside for 4 hours trying to find a way to get back into my house. My manager also claimed to have texted me and asked why I couldn’t come into work but I never got that text. My supervisor also lied about something to her so I was in even bigger trouble.

2323,Worker walk-outs in your area?,"A friend works at a local fast food joint. They overheard a call to the manager today saying that workers at several different locations had walked out together at noon today.

I'm still trying to confirm whether or not that's true, and I can't go around to check the locations myself or else I'd be taking pictures and putting that s*** on Major League blast. I'm guessing if this starts to happen in a big way it's not going to be reported about from the local news agencies. 

But that's just a guess, and I'm not trying to sound like some kind of weirdo conspiracy dude. It's big news so I can't see how they wouldn't report it, I just think maybe capitalism has pretty deep hooks, who knows?

2348,Just Quit My Job,"Fuuuuuck this bullshit.

- during the interview was told that this was a Monday through Friday job, except for rain days, which we make up for on the weekend (not a problem, but it's regularly been 6 days a week)

- during the interview was told this was a 7am to 3pm job (exactly the schedule I wanted, instead it has been 12+ hours every day instead of 8 hours)

- during the interview was asked illegal questions (married? kids? age?)

- have personally witnessed unlicensed chemical application (huge fines if caught)

- I've been treated like a mommy, maid, and babysitter

- despite DECADES of experience, I am constantly ignored when I point out that something isn't right, only for things to break, at which point I'm blamed (2 of MANY examples below)

- truck blew up (overheated and shut down) because I pointed out that the radiator was leaking, yet was brushed off/ignored

- FOUR $600 pieces of equipment were broken because I pointed out that we need to be using the correct gas:oil ratio, yet no one knew what the ratio should be and it was just being mixed willy-nilly (I ended up being the only one smart enough to look up the model number and read the owner's manual)

- EVERYONE is consistently 20-30min late with no repercussions, adding extra time to everyone's day. Even when given an extra two hours to sleep in, they still show up late. Even when they agree to ""get an early start because it's going to be super hot and humid"" they still show up late.

- boss refuses to hire more people, so we are ALWAYS understaffed and ""playing catch up""

- coworkers never come prepared and always have to stop at a local convenience store, adding extra time to everyone's day

- coworkers are constantly forgetting their PPE, adding extra time to everyone's day

-one coworker had a giant bag of candy and a cigarette for breakfast on our way to our first assignment, and went home early (didn't even help with the first assignment, was too busy breaking equipment) because he had an upset tummy (hmm, I wonder why)

- coworker did not listen to me and broke his equipment (while I was busy working and nowhere near the scene), I got blamed for it

- coworker decided on his own without my knowledge or consent to come in on our day off, unpaid (like a chump), and make ""fixes"" that I was blamed for the next day

- coworker keeps trying to ""fix"" things he has no business messing with despite being told numerous times to leave things alone or tell the person in charge of repairs, this ultimately led to me being chewed out AGAIN and ""promoted"" to the position of babysitter, yet dude still doesn't listen

- coworkers keep going home early so that I've had to work solo so many times I've lost count 

- anytime someone else has taken the truck I usually work on, I find it full of trash and piss bottles the next day

- one coworker regularly leaves early or doesn't come in at all because he continues to consume dairy products before his shift despite knowing that he's lactose intolerant (after the third incident, that bullshit is definitely intentional)

- been down to ONE barely functional piece of equipment (making my work take 2-3 times as long to complete because they don't have backups and take weeks to make simple fixes

- dispatch just adds to the schedule without even asking if we have the time or energy to do more

- when confronted about the lack of work/life balance and being physically exhausted, response from boss and dispatch was ""but we pay overtime!"" as if that excuses the appalling way they treat us like disposable robotic drones

- daily, dispatch sends us out with 15+ assignments (at an average of 30min/assignment, NOT including drive time, lunch time, or bathroom breaks) while she sits in her cushy home office as we slave away in the heat and humidity for 12-15 hours (today it was 25 assignments)

- coworker is unable to follow GPS directions that are LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO THE STEERING WHEEL and continuously misses turns

- same coworker also unable to follow verbal navigation instructions. Told him twice to make a left at the next light, dude couldn't even retain that info for TWO measly blocks and missed the turn (that was my breaking point, after he'd already done it four times)

So, yeah. After coworker missed that turn, I had him drive me back to the office. Grabbed my bag and cooler from the truck, said ""do whatever you want from here"" and walked away. 

And, going back to my point about them not listening when I speak, after I clocked out and told the boss I quit, now-ex boss was calling my phone (didn't bother to leave a voicemail), then sent me a text saying ""call me thx"". Motherfucker, what part of ""I quit"" did you not understand?!

And on that note I'm anti HR for how insufferably ineffective most, if not all HR departments are at handling HR work violations like harassment or over working employees. Since they too are employees and are trying to keep their job they always fall short.

Now, after 2 weeks of exhaustion with little to no free time, I'm starting to realize that this isn't exactly what I wanted. I can't do any sports and can't even recover from work. I am scared of my future and what will happen to me. 


What can I do? I keep telling myself to do this job for a year because it looks good on my resume and it's a good entry level job, yes... it pays good money, but is that really the only thing that matters?

2395,I Feel Hopeless.,"I am living in the EU at the moment with my wife's family and have had the blessing of not having to work for a few months, due to my not being able to find suitable employment out here. My unemployment (EDD) stopped coming in March pending an interview I'll probably never get and thousands have been withheld from me. With no income I'm being forced to move back to the states. I'm 21, only have experience in the restaurant industry and was unable to finish college before I got kicked out (private Lutheran university) for smoking weed and my parents stopped financially supporting me. I had an opportunity for some online remote work on a part-time basis for a small IT company, I worked really hard to earn it and I was really excited but they decided they don't have the money to hire me, so I'm trying to get an unpaid intership out of it so they can exploit my labor in the fleeing hopes that someday I can use the work experience to get a paying position, at the company or elsewhere. I'm looking at a bleak future, moving back in with my parents for a while when I'm back in the states, living once again in a single bedroom with my wife while she goes back to work at her retail job (which fortunately she loves) and I figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do to make enough money for us to maybe afford a shitty apartment next year. 

I just feel so gutted. My one chance at alleviating the financial stress I always feel is gone and in a weird way I'm glad I had it, because the fantasy of actually getting my EDD checks or getting this part time online job have been keeping me sane. Now I have nothing to seperate me from the grim reality of working in some shitty restaurant somewhere, with bleeding hands and constant back and knee pain. 

I'm depressed, I know I have ADHD and possibly autism though I can't afford a therapist and I doubt even a diagnosis would help as the U.S. is quite stingy with their disability checks and I don't know if I'd qualify.

If you're efficient, that's like two hours of work, six hours of downtime while they run. It can get hectic if engineers come in and tell me to do certain experiments, and absolutely back breaking when I have to clean the machines, but other than that I love it. I can run four machines at the same time and still chill on Reddit for the majority of my day. 

However, my boss just hired two new people to do my job as well because we'll be getting more machines soon. So I trained them and let them each run one machine while I juggled the other two. Once they got comfortable, they got BORED. Immediately ran their mouths to the managers that they were so tired of sitting around all day. It hasn't even been a month yet and they're only running one machine! 

Guess who just got a whole bunch of new training? Now we're responsible for part of a manager's job. Tasks that were *never* in our job description. Tasks that we *aren't* getting paid extra to do.

2405,How to not get hired so I can stay on benefits for a while?,"Notice: I haven't received a cent worth of benefits in my entire life, so I'm not a leech. I am, however, severely depressed and it shows in all my jobs, hence why I pick short ones or lose them anyway. Now that I am unemployed once again, I finally am entitled to some benefits. Enough to pay rent and bills, so just enough to not be homeless. Still, way better than working. I know I will be able to go to work anytime soon, but I haven't received one cent worth of benefits yet and I have enough savings for a year, so I do not feel one fiber in me that feels the need to get a job in the first two months. So I was wondering, how can I fulfill my duties at the unemployment center (apply for jobs, go to interviews), without getting hired for a while? 

I don't want to be a leech, on the contrary. Being on benefits for a while would have a positive effect on my mental health, helping me to stay at my next job longer and even having more time to wait for a job offer that really fits me. I always feel like the psychological pressure of the unemployment centers makes me pick a job real quickly out of shame, only ruining my health further. Honestly, I don't even care so much about losing the benefits, as long as they are off my back. But the longer I would tolerate that, the longer I would approach the end of my savings (in about a year). So getting some benefits would help. 

So is there a way I can make it seem like I'm doing my best, but then do or say something during the interview that stops employers from hiring me? Maybe even something I can sneek into my cover letters? I can't apply for ridiculous jobs because that's something they can check.",False,okck6t,WorkHater1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/okck6t/how_to_not_get_hired_so_i_can_stay_on_benefits/,11,1

2414,Glorious Purpose,"I've worked part-time since 17, did many odd-jobs, graduated from college and have been working almost every day since in either a full-time position. Like every respectable millennial (lol), I also did the quarter-life crisis thing and left my full time job then to pursue freelancing. 17 years of being in the job market, I find myself back at a full time job now, but am starting to lose all motivation bending over backwards for a team/organisation that makes it rather clear how dispensable I am. 

I'm still applying almost everywhere I can muster an ounce of interest for but mostly uninterested in every job description. Convention tells me I've yet to find my ""purpose"" and ""passion"", that when I find the ""right"" profession, I won't feel this unmotivated dread creeping back in every few years into a new job.

2415,I finally lost it,"I snapped. I broke. Three months of it is all I could take and no more. For three months I sat in a chair behind a desk; inert and for the most part alone. My job was simple: take names and make appointments. Simple right? No sweat. 

And really the job was easy, but as the expression goes: hell is other people. I had no idea what sort of environment I was entering when I stepped into that office, like an unsuspecting lamb walking into a tiger’s den. 

I had never worked an office job nor had I ever been too accustomed to white collar corporate culture. I had heard rumors of course - the familiar gripes and cliche muttering a of middle class folks the world over.  What I soon began to realize tho was that it was a club - and I wasn’t part of it - and boy did they ever hit me over the head with it. 

Now I’m an easy going kinda fella, with a simple code of ethics: you do good to me and I’ll do good to you. Respect earns respect. Take it on the chin and always look them in the eye. Yes sir, no ma’am. A real southern upbringing.

What I was met with was everything that ran counter to that code: passive aggressive behavior, informing, talking behind your back. 

At first I tried to ignore it - it was a temp job after all. I tried my best to be accommodating as I told myself it was temporary. Yet what I didn’t count on was the anxiety and dread that accompanied me every day as I walked into the office. The feeling of forever walking on eggshells.

But I was determined to press on…until I was abruptly pulled aside for a conference. My boss - along with her lackey - decided it was time for a dressing down. They said that I was a badly motivated employee, that I talked under my breath, and that she didn’t know how she expected to succeed with my attitude. 

The worst part and what crushed me most was that she was referencing conversations I had with one of the few people I thought I could trust in the office, who had been reporting every word.

That was what broke me. I simply couldn’t bear the idea of spending another day in an office full of people like this. I worked until the end of my shift and handed in my badge.

In the aftermath I’ve been down into a dark place mentally, unsure of myself, but after a week of good rest and no anxiety I’m feeling back to my old self. 

But damn me if I ever decide to get a job like that again. It isn’t worth it.",False,okg7k0,GloriousBand,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/okg7k0/i_finally_lost_it/,21,1

3. DON’T FORGET SCHOOL STAFF. While certain schools are still serving breakfast

local regulations and capacity restrictions. However, food serves and other staff may

In the past year I finally got full time status and became a front end manager. This includes doing payroll, making a schedule, and various other things. Despite all the hats I wear at this job I still only make $14.25; hardly enough to live on. 

Last week we held a hiring event because we were so desperate for help. We ended up hiring 11 minors for our front end. Today when I was doing payroll, I saw that all these kids are making a dollar less than me. 

Later on I mentioned it to my good friend, saying how we’ve been grinding our asses off for years only to be in pretty much the same exact spot as everyone else. In this moment, another manager overheard me and pulled me into the back office. 

He told me I’m going to start conflicts and “this is why we don’t discuss pay rates”. I responded with “you don’t want us to discuss pay rates because you’d have to pay us all equally”. He said some BS about it being confidential and that I’m breaking store policy. That would only be true if I specifically mentioned what the new hires are making, which I did not. 

He fully expected me to roll over and lick the boot and I could tell he’s never had someone challenge him on this.

2427,Fuck my workplace,"I already had one foot out the door because of the way they treat the people in my job role. Today, I was interviewing for two positions I am more than qualified for. At the end of the first half of the interview, I was told that I wasn't being considered and that they would not go through with having me take part in the second half of the interview. My other coworkers that have the same qualifications as me were given the full interview but one of them was told the same as I was: that he would not be considered but was encouraged to continue applying. 

The worst part of this is that even if you do stay at the company long enough to be trained on everything and be capable of doing everything you still get screwed over and they still overlook you. Actually the real worst part is that they hired several externals over internals who are more qualified for the role than the external hires. The company is already down over 20 employees and I know that the company will be losing 5 more employees (including me) by the next month or so.

2430,"Do movie productions have to be so punishing? What would an ""anti-work"" way of producing stuff look like?","I love movies. I love making movies.

With rare exceptions, I’ve never particularly enjoyed being on a film set. Even compared to the myriad shitty workplace environments that modern life offers, film sets have always felt especially heavy to me.

Marathon hours are the norm, as they are in many industries, but what pushes film sets over the top is the incredible aggressiveness with which people treat each other. I’ve seen that in the restaurant industry as well, but restaurant workers only put up with so much, while film set workers see their lot as “their chance at their passion.” So they put up with much more, to the point of carrying it as a badge of honor.

I heard one time (though I’m not sure that this is 100% true), that Jean Renoir’s 1936 *Partie de Campagne* was a very chill production process—with long hours, yes, but with a small crew of friends having fun…it almost doubled as a vacation. Ever since then, I’ve tried to model my processes to have a similar feel.

I tell people/myself that skeleton crews are part of how I work due to necessity and/or artistic vision…but if I have to be honest, I just think they’re much more chill, human and sane.  Maybe I'm just scared of  the ""real filmset"" environment. 

What would a true “anti-work” or “anti-job” method of filmmaking look like? Has someone experimented with one yet?

Got 2 jobs . i some days feel like yall but the reason why i dont complain or slack off is bevause the end of they day that wont solve shit.

2476,Gave my bosses what they asked for - not what they wanted,"Since about October of last year, my company implemented a much more robust activity-tracking software to the computers of everyone below supervisor pay-grade (you know, the generic office folks, the plebeians, such as myself). This software tracks which websites and applications you use at any given time, and the main function explicitly was to keep track of idle time. The software would count up every second you weren't typing or moving your mouse and report it to your supervisor by rating you from 1 to 10 on how active you were (10 being the highest).

I always thought the idea of tracking idle time was ridiculous as the company was already tracking how many processes you completed in a given day, so I paid no mind to the additional software and worked as I always had.

Naturally, this led to me having conversations with my supervisors about my idle time. Generally, my idle time was quite high, which was something I already knew - but now it had become ""problematic."" During these conversations, I repeatedly suggested that the ultimate goal of this new activity-tracking was to increase productivity, not activity. The company just wanted to make sure office workers were completing more processes in a given day; my supervisors agreed this was the case. So I asked if there was an issue with my level of productivity, and the response was ""No - you just need to lower your idle time.""

Easy enough.

I have since resorted to weighing down one of my keyboard keys when I'm not actively working, which is enough to fool our activity-tracking software into thinking that I'm active. My activity score shot up drastically into the high 9s whereas it sat around 3 or 4 previously. For the last few months, everything has been just dandy in my supervisors' eyes, and I have not increased my productivity at all.

Well yesterday, I was provided with my mid-year review. Among the concerns listed for my overall performance, there were several mentions of my productivity being poor, approximately for the last 9 months (since last October - sound familiar?). This was quite surprising, as during every single interim meeting I've had with my supervisors, they have not once mentioned anything about my productivity; the conversation has solely been centered around my activity - which had increased drastically and was now consistently high.

I have a meeting later today to go over my mid-year review with my supervisors. I plan on telling them they had 9 months to tell me to improve my productivity, and since they didn't - not even once! - everything must actually be just fine. We'll just see how that goes, I guess. But if they had just mentioned they actually wanted higher productivity, they would have received it.

 A superorganism can be defined as ""a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective"" '  


We cannot survive alone. Farmers need labourers, labourers need farmers, we all need administrators and teamsters, we all need each other to survive. Division of labour is for us highly specialized.  


We need to act collectively to create the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. We have enough food and housing for everyone, yet there is a hunger and homelessness crisis. This is by design so we are desperate enough to allow capitalists to extract our value. This is extortion. We need to have a UBI so people cannot be exploited. Once that's in place capitalists will be forced to let us keep more of the value of our labour.   


And personally I think it needs to go beyond that to. To make it impossible for anyone to extract value from anyone else. To enrich yourself you must enrich others in equal measure. Thats a real team and community, not an abusive exploitation. To me this means mandatory worker-owned co-ops. But of course there are a wide variety of other models to ensure labour continues, and is incentivized in a moral way without exploitation.

2506,"Why are so many job interviews so pretentious, unnecessarily lengthy, and overly complicated instead of being straightforward and concise?","I honestly don't understand the full purpose(s) of it. I'm pretty sure if you are on this subreddit you must have already read some rants/discussions about the state of hypocrisy or pretentious attitudes in workplaces and so on, either in this sub itself or elsewhere. In all of my work experience (and to some extents, honest accounts from people I know), some of us rarely or even never got good results for being very candid and straightforward. In fact, I only got the job I'm working and liking because I kinda ""played along"" with the atmosphere (and of course, I had to look competent enough).   


I've never gone to a job interview where the atmosphere of the conversation feels relaxing or transparent, or received any sort of signs to be completely frank with the interviewer. Maybe that's just my own experience, I just have a string of coincidences or whatever.

I've been sending out resumes every week as a requirement for my UI payments. I am honest and send resumes to jobs that I am sort of qualified for, but my resume is pretty weak. I just send the same one-page resume to all these jobs. These are all Easy Apply remote-work tech jobs on Indeed and Ziprecruiter. I usually never hear back from any of these job applications as they get hundreds of applicants.

Suddenly this week I get messages from three of these jobs I just applied to that want to call me for a phone screen. They can't be that desperate to be impressed by my resume. Maybe they just pay crap for wages.

Since I don't really care if I get hired I feel like I can be relaxed about these inquiries and maybe ask questions of these employers that someone who really wants a job might be hesitant to ask.

2511,Genuine question from a fellow anti-worker,"I'll start by saying I have yet to see a post on this sub that I disagree with and that a certain demographic of people (not ONLY boomers but they do make up a larger portion) have the absolute bullshit opinion of:

'Work 9-5, 5 days a week, 8 weeks of holiday a year, retire at (insert age no one wants to fucking be)' 

What I am looking for is PROOF that these people in the 70's and 80's had it better work and pay-wise. I see a lot of anecdotal things on here which I don't doubt to be true for a second, but where can I look to see more information about all this?

I'm looking for cold hard data that cannot be denied or disputed. Inflation rates from 1970 to present, minimum wage, cost of rent/mortgages. Basically everything down to the cost of a fucking MARS BAR.

The reason I ask is, when I voice my opinion of not wanting to work full time (35-40 hours) at just about any job and come home to house/flatshare and a meagre life outside of this, people will say to me 'that's just work, what do you expect?' Or something along those lines.

I essentially want to be able to give information to people that isn't 'well look at what this person on the internet wrote about the their dad in the 70's' 

So the real concise question: Where can I find numerical data that shows that we (our current generation) are being fucked over financially?

2514,Just need to vent about this BS interview that happened and the result,"First time posting here and just joined the sub and have a very young account so if this gets removed whatever, maybe I will come back later to bitch about this absolute bullshit. Also I am going to curse a lot so maybe this is NSFW but I would think most people aren't scrolling a sub wanting to end work while at work. Going to be vague about the position I was applying to and the people I interviewed with for privacy's sake, don't think my friend is on reddit but just in case, but they are department heads and C level people so I'm a bit nervous because I am a human. I also have pretty bad anxiety and have to take meds just to get through the day without having a panic attack. Not trying to give a life story but this sets up the bullshitery. Sorry for the long read I'll put a TLDR at the end.

A friend of mine put in a good word for me at his company in a department he has nothing to do with, so it's not like he could force me through but I really appreciate him doing what he could despite his shitty company rejecting me. I went in for the interview, arrived early dressed in a suit and tie as one does. I was called in quickly and sat down with one person who was not technically interviewing me but was definitely interviewing me. 

She tells me about the job because it is different from the one I applied for (she had suggested this job to my friend to give to me, and then they switched it to something else after I had applied, allegedly they had been having trouble finding someone and I'm guessing my story is probably why, they disqualify people for the dumbest shit) so already I am coming in less prepared than I would like to be because I had no idea what the actual job responsibilities were until just then, I could only assume they would be similar to the job I actually applied for.

Talk with her for a bit and have a pleasant conversation that is mostly casual. Then the person I was really interviewing came in. She goes more in depth about the position, we talk about my background and she asks a few ""Can you tell me about a time you did x"" type questions related to the nature of the position, and those are the only questions she asks really. I feel that I answered all of them very adequately if not better than that, really thought I was doing well, though I was a bit nervous all the same because as I said I have anxiety and also am a fucking human. 

Last question is a ""fun"" one, what do you like to do for fun? I said cooking and we both go back and forth about how we have to have exact ingredient measurements and how our moms always just say ""throw in some paprika"" and we have to ask how much, laughing the whole time, and I don't feel so nervous anymore at this point and feel like I have made a good impression, and why ask that stupid fucking question otherwise, though I know it is a common one, it is usually asked early on. I can't remember having it be the final question, if they had asked this first it probably would have taken the edge off a bit, at the end it seems pointless.

I know just because the interviewer is amiable doesn't mean I got the job, but I felt I had done very well and that the interviewer and I got along well which is also important imo. I think the receptionist even said something like ""bye see you later!"" as I was leaving so I was like maybe the first person interviewing me told her I did really well or something, but maybe I misheard or it was just something she says. Ok this is in the bag I thought. I have been rejected from dozens of jobs just like everyone else and I could generally tell it wasn't going to happen by the time I am leaving, this is the first time I felt that I did extremely well and didn't get the job.

Next day comes and right after I send a thank you email to the first person my friend texts me and says hey sorry man they are going to go with someone else but they wanted to offer some ""constructive criticism"". Here is all they said: I seemed very nervous and I yawned a few times, which sometimes happens when I'm nervous because I talk fast and sometimes get out of breath, which causes me to yawn sometimes. And I am interviewing with a very high level employee, so yea, nervous. Also I have been out of a job for a while. 3 things I literally cannot control or change. That isn't constructive criticism, it's the exact opposite. 

You just told me I didn't get the job because of things I cannot change and I have never felt so defeated in my life. Like fuck you for disqualifying me for being human. I left a part time hospital job in March of last year because of Covid and my parents and myself having underlying conditions and focused on finishing up my Master's in the field the job was in. Oh yea forgot to add that at the beginning, I have a fucking Master's and this is an entry level job. And they don't even have the decency to email or call me themselves, they relay all of this through my friend like fucking cowards. Fuck employers and all the hoops they want you to jump through when they barely fucking respect the applicants.

I can't fucking win. You can't have this job because you haven't had a job in a while because of a fucking pandemic and you were bettering yourself by finishing up your advanced degree. Even my friend's good word wasn't enough for them to overlook some extremely minor shit. Don't fucking ask me that bullshit cutesy question at the end if you have already decided not to hire me based on extremely minor shit and not my qualifications, fuck you for wasting my time I hope whoever you do hire is a toxic piece of shit and brings the whole department down (though I am probably coming off a bit toxic right now it's because I am fucking angry, I have never had any coworkers complain about me and generally make a lot of friends at work). Fuck you fuck you fuck you. Fuck.

TLDR: Friend helped get me an interview in a different department of the company they had allegedly been having trouble filling, I feel the interview has gone well and all signs point to this imo, not 100% but I feel like with a long time and trusted employee reference I have a great shot. Friend texts me I didn't get it but they gave ""constructive"" criticism by saying I seemed nervous (I have anxiety that I take meds for just to function) and that I yawned a few times, literally an involuntary and natural function. Also I have been between jobs for too long during a fucking pandemic where 100s of thousands have been unemployed, and I was getting my fucking Master's in the field the job was in during that time.

2518,A supervisor thankful for this subreddit community,"I joined this subreddit fairly recently. It articulates a lot of my thoughts on capitalism more generally, but especially the way I have been feeling about my own job for the past couple of years. 

In my (small) organization (within a larger institution), I am the highest paid employee below my boss, who is a millionaire. I am responsible for hiring and supervising employees, among many other duties. Now, I am not even remotely rich, and sometimes I wonder if I even qualify as “middle class” given the fact that the promotions I’ve received are not reflective of the amount of work/hours that I do at all, and the fact that I live in a tiny condo that I can’t pay off any time soon. The bank will continue to own the roof over my head for decades. 

I do supervise a group of employees, and there are many things about this subreddit that make me angry about my own position. I try to advocate for our employees constantly. My boss forces me to make our employees work extra hours and weekends regularly, without the extra pay. Even when I argue that they should get a bonus for their extra time or attempt to fight for them to get compensation time off, he denies it. Often, he says it’s fine, and then he changes his mind very last minute. And it’s always me that has to deliver the bad news to them that they won’t actually get the promised time off/pay that they deserve. When I fight for promotions for them, I have to argue with him down to the penny. He never thinks they are worth the raises that I argue for. As a rich man, he does not comprehend the cost of living for people who aren’t rich. He thinks we are all “very well paid.” 

Before you tell me that I should go to HR and report him, I would like to point out that my boss cannot be fired, and he is one of the most valuable assets to the entire organization. This is not a battle that I can win, and if I tried, I would be fired myself (and perhaps even sued). 

I myself have not received a raise in 3 years but am actively fighting for the promotion of our employees to keep up with the rising inflation rate. 

This subreddit has been an important source of comfort to me and has made me so much more aware of the toxic environment I work in. I am regularly expected to respond to emails until late at night and to work on weekends. I have no energy for friends and family in my limited free time. I have no power to help our employees. I am regularly asked to put my job before my health. The reason why I’m posting this is because I want people to know that, very often, your supervisor is just as helpless as you. They may be actively advocating for your well-being but getting denied by their own supervisor. Within the last year, I have been standing for what I believe in much more than usual, but I am reaching a point where I feel completely disillusioned. Often, I feel that I’d rather just give up and work at a lower paying job that is less intellectually stimulating, but that gives me less power. Because sometimes, even when we are in a powerful position, the man above still beats us down. Thanks to this sub for keeping me in check and calling out my own bad habits, like caving into the 60-70 hour weeks, working on weekends, and responding to emails at all hours. I needed something like this community to make me realize how messed up my work environment truly is.

2519,Don't know what to do anymore,"So I've been working since 18, came from a small crappy town, poor family, the usual. Also had a really traumatic life that has destroyed my mind. I haven't worked for just about a year. I worked full-time and did full-time study, graduating just before the pandemic. Then my mind fell apart and I had to stop work, I was suicidal everyday and kept calling in sick, as I did with work in the past too. Me and working life don't get along, I find the workplace to be extremely triggering, and my mind is too messed up to have a boss and responsibilities. Now my doctor is asking how they can get me back to work, everyone is asking when I'm getting a job and getting back into work, it's driving me insane. I haven't had much help with my mental health, and I can't work. I don't want to work but I don't have the luxury of savings and all that stuff. I wouldn't mind 'working' if I could be paid to do something I like or that I'm good at, but I still feel totally unmotivated and trapped in a system that seems to only exist to make me (and other women) feel bad.
How did everyone else do it? Am I just going to have to ""fix"" my brain and get back to work so that I don't die?

This was birth the first job that has paid me to sit down, AND the first job that hasn't expected me to be busy clock in to clock out. they were lax on breaks, I could take a fucking shit at work with out causing an emergency. Just literally normal shit that should be the minimal expectation from any employer made this by far the best job I've ever hoped to have. 

I fucking hate my life. I genuinely do. I hate every god damned second of it. Everything even remotely good is held over my head like some kind of fucking prize and yanked away the second i get comfortable. I tried so fucking hard to keep this job, and got into an accident and got cut immediately due to their trail period rules.  

So I'm back to no insurance, no income, likely going to find some shitty job that's upwards of sixty hours a week and night shift. Who fucking knows? Maybe I'll be back on my fucking feet again, in pain literally 24/7 just to afford fucking rice and eggs. I didn't even get to get away from the job search grind for a couple of months. 

My bosses said the important thing is no one got hurt. Doesn't get me my job back, does it? Said I could have died. Well golly fucking gee dead people don't have to fucking sit in their room and wrestle with absolutely retarded expectations for a dozen applications do they? I'd literally rather have that, because literally just being able to work and sleep and play dnd twice a month in peace was apparently too fucking much to ask for.  

What the fuck is the point? Why am I bothering? What merit is there in not putting a fucking bullet in my head? I can not convey the pressure I'm under. I can not fucking do this any more. 

I got this job by literally being near life-long friends with the HR's husband. Do not have another chance. I've pulled all my strings. I've called in all my favors. This was it. And it wasn't like I was out of my league, everyone told me how fucking good i was doing and how I was making it look easy.

2588,Just some thoughts on immigrant values,"Of course I have to start this post off with a disclaimer I'm not nationalistic or xenophobic nor am I advocating for that.  

Studies have shown that immigrants who moved to western societies from 'not?' western societies tend to have a more individualistic outlook than their fellow country men who did not.  I don't remember what article I read, sorry y'all. Regardless...

My own parents are from southeast Asia and to put it lightly are completely full of shit.  I'm just talking about me specifically so no offense to people with immigrants in their families from war-torn countries or those escaping oppressive poverty.  When my parents moved to this country they both held bachelor's degrees in engineering.  On my mother's side my grandpa was an engineer and on my dad's side my grandpa was an engineering professor.  The more I think about their stories of 'struggle' and 'how hard they worked' the more I realize how full of shit they are.  They were by no means rich growing up but never struggled to put food on the table and always were comfortably middle class in their home country.  They came here on student visas and my dad originally came to America to start an Aerospace Engineering PhD at Northwestern fucking University.  My parents have never once acknowledged the decades of privilege that they had or have ever thought that even when they were struggling for money they had means to achieving financial stability many would kill for.  Nope it's always just ""we worked really hard and struggled really hard blah blah."". Additionally my great grandparents worked for the British government under colonialism, so I don't have a very strong history of moral fiber in my family 🙁.

I began asking myself what kind of values would cause a person to leave a relatively stable life?  Both my parents are shameless neo-liberals, racist, provincial, elitists, who always made sure to stress the value of 'studying so hard you want to cry your eyes out to make us proud.' So my theory is they just ran away from their problems rather than staying and addressing the cultural issues in their own families.  They saw an opportunity to enrich themselves and jumped on it without thinking about the consequences of their actions.  Do keep in mind nothing in the US has ever happened by accident, Google didn't support policies like skilled labor visas because they thought it would be good for the working class (global altruism lmfao), they did it because they knew they could pay an Indian engineer 65k a year for the same job they'd have to pay a citizen 150k to do.

TLDR; my parents are pieces of shit who have lived incredibly privileged and coddled lives who refuse to acknowledge that there ability to 'make it' in the US has been the result of decades of privilege combined with neo-liberal policies at the expense of the working class.

2589,I’m so stumped right now,"Honestly I don’t even know what to do I’m at the end of my job hunt sort of I’m mainly just trying to see what I should settle for that would make me wanna kill myself the least and maybe actually give me some time to somehow learn some new skills to get a better job. What would you guys do between these 2 jobs, I have one job that’s a temp-to-hire for like 90 days and it’s at a climate-controlled medical warehouse and you can sit actually you just make like these small medical devices. My biggest con is that they don’t allow phones on the floor you have to lock em up in a locker (although I just toured the warehouse and there’s no way those employees aren’t just keeping them in their pockets or something LOL). It starts at $16/hr. Also the schedule there is 4 10-hour days Monday-Thursday, so.. that’s kind of dope... PTO is ok too I forget what they said but ik you start with 20 hours of sick time once you’re hired on and I think 20 hours of vacation time (not sure can’t remember lol).I also have this other job that’s at a warehouse for foil in the downtown area and I’d be a custodian but I wouldn’t really be cleaning bathrooms I’d be with other custodians cleaning certain sections of the warehouse (the line, break rooms, etc) and they rotate. The biggest con with that warehouse though is it’s a 7-day work week but you rotate days off so you work 7 days, off 1 day, work 7 days, off 2 days, and work 7 days, off 4 days and then the rotation starts again. That also starts at $16.39/hr but it can go up really quick b/c since it’s a warehouse you can bid on other jobs that pay way more in there. Another sort of big con is you only get one week of vacation even with working all those hours. I have heard the work isn’t too bad in there though and they don’t care if you work so far ahead that you have free time and run down the clock, one of my friends that works there says he always free time in between b/c he got so good at the jobs. Idk I’m stumped b/c the bottom line is I need money but I also don’t want work to drive me fucking insane like my current job is doing me right now and I’m trying to get the fuck out.

2592,How do I get out of this mental prison?,"Due to some lucky investments I made years ago, I don't have to work to afford the basic necessities. But I still work which makes me this that the problem is not necessarily money.

I tell myself it's because I like the finer things in life but a big part of all this is I feel ashamed if I don't work. I feel bad if I don't work BUT at the same time I feel depressed and anxious because everyone else in my work leans in to the idea that they have to devote the majority of their time on the job. I feel like an imposter because I really do not want to invest so much of my life into this career yet when I do not work in a career that is lucrative, I feel like I provide no value to society and it makes me feel bad. 

When I don't work, I feel bad. When I do work, I feel bad too. It's like I'm in some sort of mental prison and the only way to forget that I'm in this prison is to spend money. I know I'm extremely privileged compared to most people which amplified my self loathing. 

Is it normal to feel like I'm a hamster running on a wheel dreaming of when I no longer have to be on the wheel yet whenever I'm not on the wheel, all I'm trying to do is figure out ways to get back on the wheel.

Even though I'm 20, I still live with my mother. Since 2018, I've had 4 jobs. Whenever I lose a job, my mother gives me 1 year to get another one and if I fail at that, she kicks me out. So far, I haven't reached the deadline, my longest time without a job was 8 months throughout 2020 and that was largely a result of the pandemic ( which is still going on but the media likes to pretend that it's over ). 

Although my mom constantly berates me for being ''lazy'' because I'm not searching for job opportunities 24/7, I kinda like being jobless. It gives me time to work on a lot of personal stuff, although I can't do everything since I have no income and currently have under 600 dollars to my name. Regardless, I've been able to spend time on writing and I'm trying to lose 30 pounds, which requires to me to be at the gym for 75 minutes every day, and having a job would greatly inhibit me from doing that.

2612,Do I go to my boss or HR?,"I started a new job a month and a half ago. It is nothing like they described to me over video chat. They said I would be working with a team of people my age and get the chance to meet a lot of people. I also never saw the office since it was over Zoom. I sit in a cubical alone in the back corner of a large office surrounded by empty cubicles and fluorescent lighting for 9 hours a day. Everyone works from home in my department but me and 1 girl who is only in 2 days. She is quitting and this is her last week. So 1 month in all the responsibility will be on me and I will be the only person in my department in this office. I relocated to the area for this job and spend all day alone at work and then go home to be alone all night. I am miserable. I have been applying for other jobs but barely get any calls so I'm worried I'll be stuck here a minute.

I broke down crying yesterday because I had gone 4 hours without a call or anyone checking in on me with no work to do. Literally got 1 call in 8 hours and it was my boss asking me to send an email. The receptionist noticed I was down and I told her I hate that I am alone in my department. She told me to go to HR and tell them how I feel. I don't want to piss my boss off since it's just her and I in this office now (well I only see her 2 days a week anyway.) But this needs to be said and heard. I feel isolated and unsupported. I do not get paid to do the whole department's work and someone needs to know I am stressed. I am still new and feel completely neglected. All my training has been over email or a document the last girl wrote before resigning (lacks a lot of detail.)

Also, today is the perfect storm of my boss and co-worker being in the office (this only happens 1 day a week) so I'm not sure if I should talk to her today or tomorrow when just my boss will be in. Would HR be more appropriate for this?

I always considered myself fairly self aware, I knew I wasn't ever going to fit in with the ""normal"" sort of career path after high school, but it still took me years to truly accept my feelings versus society's expectations. Having been suicidally depressed basically my whole adult life so far (I'm 28 as of tomorrow), its crazy looking back on how much of that depression was fueled by guilt for not being able to just be satisfied with the jobs I had. I spent SO MUCH energy feeling weak and worthless. On a spiritual level I was even directing my existential anger at the universe for what I felt was setting the bar too high on reality itself. As if working a 9-5 rat race job was some universal truth....ugh.

Then last year happened, and after quarantine I realized I just couldn't bring myself to go back to work, which was the only job I had been able to hold after going through a few years of trying different jobs, having mental breakdowns and quitting those jobs, then repeating that process. Enough was enough. Seeing the USA's response to the pandemic was the tipping point. I knew this country's work culture was fucked up, but it was incredible to see it fail so completely and so OBVIOUSLY before everyone's eyes.  We've been working for bread crumbs, and then nature comes in and brings the world to its knees, a time when you'd think it'd be a no-brainer for the government to do at least the bare minimum in getting its people through this, if only to maintain the illusion that they care. Not only do they not care, they don't even care enough to pretend to care. I finally had my moment of antiwork nihilism after that. Capitalism wasn't this inevitable, all-powerful force that dictates a ""survival of the fittest"" society. Its literally just a bunch of emotionally immature, privileged, fucks making themselves richer while exploiting the fear and vulnerability of others. I had been through hell in dealing with my mental illness for years....why the fuck should I waste one more minute beating myself up by trying to justify the absurdity of living paycheck to paycheck?

They want me to get my driver's license, and so do I. But getting a license is next to impossible here in BC. But they also said I need to get a job... While I *do* need the money, I do *NOT* want a job. My parents themselves have said that they are ""content with being wage-slaves"". And constantly nag on me for not wanting a job. (Evidently using the word ""lazy"")

I am absolutely *NOT* content with being a wage-slave. That is *NOT* a goal for me... But what other choice do I have??? I've been trying to find a job here where I live throwing out applications and resumes left and right for 9 months now and can't even land a fucking interview. Why am I be called ambitionless and lazy if I can't even get the *chance* to be ""productive""??

I don't want to ruin my *already* deteriorated mental health for shit jobs that barely pays fucking minimum wage. The ol' classic ""Need experience for a job, but need a job for experience"". I don't want to be apart of this money-hungry capitalistic machine society calls life. I don't want to be apart of a world where companies prioritize money over well-being.

I have trouble planning things for the future, because I *see no future.* Climate change is at an irreversible tipping point. Wealth inequalities has been growing depressingly faster and larger. And human rights are constantly being ignored by companies and governments with no repercussions.

My grandparents bought a three floor house for $23,000 30 years ago. I can't even find 1 bedroom apartments that go less than 2500 a month. I will *NEVER* be able to buy a house. And somehow its *MY* fault for not having one. The system is screwed up, the odds and cards will always be against me, and the game was rigged a long time ago.

I quit my first job after 2 days because it was making me extremely miserable and I knew the hours/duties were not a good fit. The only reason I took it up is because I was getting desperate to just find any job. I then found another job that was a better fit but I still had difficulty with giving up 40+ hours of my life every week. After 3 months I started having suicidal thoughts and was told by my doctor that I had situational depression. I somehow stayed at that job for 6 months before finding another job that allows for wfh 2 days of the week. I thought the hybrid schedule would help me. In between the two jobs I took a two week break and during those two weeks I was the happiest I’d been for months. I started my new job yesterday and have cried multiple times since. The suicidal thoughts are also coming back. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to quit so badly before i reach rock bottom but I have no idea what I would do after that. Any 9-5 would make me feel this way. l live with my parents so I don’t have to worry about rent or anything (for now) but they are asian and do not understand why my “easy” desk job is making me unhappy when there are people who have it way worse than me. It’s driving me crazy that they don’t understand and see me as a lazy good for nothing.

2664,Yesterday I volunteered,"With a group called TCV (the conservation volunteers) here in the north of England. We worked on a path along a soil eroded river bank, cut back some invasive plants (Himalayan balsam), and built some insect habitats. 

The instructions were to work as hard or easy as we like, take plenty of brakes, and basically to enjoy it. There’s a range of ages and abilities, so some people can’t do lots and just chip in here and there. There’s also some volunteers with mental ill health, and some with learning disabilities, and some with autism, and others who’re able bodied. 

Our instructions were we could chat as much as we liked, or just keep to ourselves if socialising isn’t our thing. No judgement. 

I can’t begin to describe how satisfying and life affirming it was. But this is because I gave my labour/time freely - it would actually be ruined if pay would’ve been involved. 

And this is work that needed doing. The local council had asked for the work to be done. Here was a group of volunteers, a very diverse group, willing to get involved and enjoy themselves in the process. 

It just goes to show what everyone in this sub already knows - it isn’t about work! It’s about money, how it dominates everything we do, how it curtails our freedom, and how it allows us to be exploited. 

Another economy is possible. If we shared our prosperity, no one would be financially insecure, and there would undoubtedly be an explosion in “good works”.",False,ok1cei,RegularDivide2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ok1cei/yesterday_i_volunteered/,11,1

There is a sandwhich shop from my state and over the years they have grown a lot and have locations in a few different states across the country.

Well my mom sent a picture that of a sign in their front window that claimed no one wants to work anymore and please be patient with the staff.

I was going to contact them and find out they were paying low wages and point that out to my right leaning family.

But what I found out was that this particular restaurant is not even hiring. When I went on the companies website they only had 5 job postings for the entire state and not a single one was for that location. The website did have the sandwich maker jobs and stuff listed for other stores. So it’s not a matter of them just not listing that job on their website.

So either this store is straight up lying about being short staffed.

They are i the risky keeping staffing levels low and shifting the blame onto the working class by saying no one wants to work anymore.

About 4 months ago I got fired from my job and have been so much happier since then. Sadly I've had to take a job again because money got tight, but I've noticed an immediate and very noticeable decrease in my self-worth and motivation since I started working again.

Been doing YouTube in the hopes to one day monetize as I genuinely love making gaming videos but isn't likely for a long time. I just wish I could make money from home and get to spend time with my GF doing stuff that's important, not busting my ass for people who'd replace me in a heartbeat

How many of you like to work in the company you work for?

I work at IKEA Portugal's call center and I actually like the job and I like my co-workers and boss. The pay is above average and I have the possibilty of ""only"" working part-time due to living with my family.

Although I like the job I still believe we should have higher raises. The fault of that is now enough unionezed workers. I'm currently joining a union.

This being said I still believe that the job market is deeply unfair and most companies are not good companies to work in and a lot of bosses are not great at all.

I believe that everyone who wants to should be able to work fewer hours. Everyone should have be respected as worker and have a good living wage.

The rich should be more taxed. Fuck the billionaries and their lifestyle. While there are still people at the present going hungry and malnurished how can a person have a lavish lifestyle and ride a Porsche and vacation in the Maldives?

I believe that rich people are selfish. Rich people are too revered. What we should aspire to is a middle class lifestyle.

I maintained the equipment when it broke down and everything. Well the lead had serious health problems so they eventually put him in the main office to keep him on till he retired. 

Next thing you know I was put in charge of a department that required at least 3 people but with only me now, the other welder was sent to another department. Well I kept telling them ""I'm only 1 person quit giving me the work for 3+ people"". I was at work so much that one time I spent 30 hours up there at one time. This is only a small fraction of what I had to deal with there. Yes the pay was Amazing, about 70k+ in a good year but it was not worth it. Since starting work there I now take antidepressants and I'm constantly fighting depression. 

I hate it when people say ""Money doesn't buy happiness"" BULLSHIT it may not but if sure fucking helps. We're ""living"" paycheck to paycheck these days and I'm constantly taking days off work because I wake up crying because of the depression.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 

Drapetomania was a conjecture mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans
fleeing captivity.(1!1 Contemporarily reprinted in the South, Cartwright's article was widely mocked and satirized in the northern United States. The concept
has since been debunked as pseudoscience!? and shown to be part of the edifice of scientific racism.)

The term derives from the Greek Sparrétng (diabetes, ""a runaway [slave]"") and pain (mania, ""madness, frenzy"").

Is late as 1914, the third edition of Thomas Lathrop Stedman's Practical Medical Dictionary included an entry for drapefomania, defined as
""Vagabondage, dromomania; an uncontrollable or insane repulsion to wander."")

2730,Please look after your mental health &lt;3,"Hey AntiWorkers...

I couldn't really figure a better place to post this thread without getting downvoted to oblivion while having many people disagreeing with my reasonings. Most of us hate our jobs I agree, but there are a few percentage that don't and all power to them. Maybe someday we can find something we truly like and enjoy. 

Currently on leave at the moment and not working, over the last few days I have known some massive significant changes that I thought was completely suppressed turns out it wasn't. Most of the time I am really depressed and angry because of work. We need money to survive right ? I just couldn't get back to myself and everything in my mind was just cluttered. 

Without working the improvement's I have noticed are 

• Less sleep.   
• Eating less, better appetite control.    
• Focusing more on leisure activities.  
• Ability to read and watch more videos with out zoning out (last time it took me 1 week to read through 1000+ pages)   
• Recently turned my Xbox on for the first time in 6+ months, just went out and purchased CyberPunk 2077.   
• Not worrying about capitalism and not giving a fuck about money   
• More energy   
• Inspired to do more things and motivated to get better (self improvement)   
• I'm less angry now, before the smallest thing would tick me off. I can control my own emotions better.  
• Not having to put on a fake personality at work and dealing with bullshit that has no meaning to my life.   
• Better relationship with family, haven't had a single argument in nearly 6 days which is awesome.   
• Willing to spend a bit more money in the community and supporting small business, before I was a fucking tight ass and would not spend a single cent.   
• I'm becoming more spiritual and connecting within myself more.   
• I'm less schizophrenic and have less intrusive thought's in my mind.    
• NSFW Please see spoiler if you want to proceed &gt;!Improved testosterone and libido (previously I would only masturbate once a week feel like shit/brain fog and would have no semen left after 1 session it would take me another 1 week to recover and get back to clarity state. Now I can go 2 times a day and feel fine and can go again the next day again with out any issues. I'm currently 5 days off work and have done it 7 times now and feeling great, I haven't experienced this since I was like 18, I'm 27 now!&lt;

Before my days off I was just working, working, working. Even tho I do still eat properly and exercise my body and mental health was just no quite right. I was always surrounded by Senior MD's talking about MONEY and MORE MONEY all the time, trying to hit KPI's of 6 figures daily and 7 figures weekly which just annoyed the fuck out of me. 

Now I just don't give a fuck about my work, I honestly don't feel like going back and happy to find something else that revolves more around helping people that's none ""Money"" centric. 

I don't know why so many people look down and frown those who don't work, infact I am jealous. Because this is the happiest I have been in a very long time, I was burnt out now I am recovering. 

For any one out there who faces depression or mental illness like myself, don't be afraid to take time off and look after yourself, you deserve the absolute best because time is the most important asset as well as our own happiness.",False,ojy26m,tofufizza,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ojy26m/please_look_after_your_mental_health_3/,6,1

might be committing time clock fraud!

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

e Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

e Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

e Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

e Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

e Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

of 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100
minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

2739,Boring Jobs,"Anyone else have a boring, mindless job that essentially asks you to pretend to be busy for 8-10 hours a day? About a year ago, I quit a job from a shitty employer who piled the work of 3-4 people onto me with no care for my well being. There was not enough time in the day to get it all done by a long shot. 

I then moved to a company that paid better with a lot less work and stress but I mean it's A LOT less work. Like, there are days where I've done maybe 15 minutes of work in an 8-hour day. I know because I've counted lol. I know this, to most people, would be considered a luxury but it is pure torture. Even with nothing to do, you have to look busy (ie, have a spreadsheet open, be clicking your mouse, clacking on your keyboard, etc.) as people walk by constantly and my boss works right next to me (open office environment). Minutes go by so slow. It's like the torture technique where they splash a drop of water on your forehead every couple of seconds. Just mind-numbingly boring. 

 I've tried everything to make it easier. I've turned off the clocks on my computer. I've embedded Spanish vocabulary into my spreadsheets. I've budgeted my expenses. I've created mock retirement plans. I've done the math on how much I can live if I just quit today (which won't happen without health insurance,  unfortunately). I've done extensive research on vacations (that I'll never take). I've created an exercise routine (that I'm usually too tired to follow). All of this within one spreadsheet that I can have up on my screen without worrying. But I don't known what else to do. I still come home completly exhausted by spending 8 hours doing nothing. Spending 8 hours a day on ANYTHING is exhausting. 

I also refuse to ask for more work. I've done that in my past and I got exploited for it and I will not let that happen again. I still consider myself lucky that I'm not overworked anymore but there's got to be an alternative to this endless, slow charade week after week.

I take a nap cuz I gotta be right back at it at 1am again, I get around 11:45pm and noticed I was still in pain once I stepped out of bed, I sucked it up, got dressed and I barley made it to my car, a usually 40 second walk turned into a 5 minute walk.

2754,So here are the 17 Passive income ideas 2021 that helps you to make money passively:- (Antiwork),"So what is passive income exactly? 

Passive income is an income stream where you put your time, efforts, and money at the beginning to create it, and in the future, it will pay you passively without doing any work or little work. 

Here is one thing I noticed that many people have a theory about passive income, and that theory is passive income doesn’t require any work. It just pays you without doing anything. 

I want to clarify something about this theory. 

According to my perspective, that is 50% true and 50% false. 

True because when you have an established passive income stream, then it won’t require any work from you. 

False because when you’re in the path of establishing a passive income stream, it requires lots of time, effort, skills, and money. 


So here are the 17 Passive income ideas 2021 that helps you to make money passively:-

1. Invest In A REIT:
Investing in real estate is one of the ways you can build a passive income for you. So if you are interested but do not want to invest in real estate directly, then here you can consider REIT.
REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) is a company that owns and manages income-producing real estate.

As an investor, you’ll earn what REIT pays its investors.

There are some REITs platforms like Streitwise and Fundrise, which you can consider for your investments.


2. Dividend Stocks:
Companies pay their shareholders quarterly, and your earning potential depends on how many shares you’re holding of that company.
The more shares of stock you’re holding, then the more your earning will be higher. 

Investing in dividend stocks could be a great way of earning passive incomes. 

3. Rent Your Home:
Renting the whole property or just renting a room can be an excellent way to generate passive income every month. If you have any property, apartment, or a room in your house which you’re not using, then you can turn that into a money-making opportunity.  
There are several websites like Airbnb, where you can add your room for rent.

4. Renting Your Car:
Pretty much similar to renting your home, now you can rent out your car. Let your car make money for you when you’re not using it. If you have a car or more than one car, then you have the opportunity to rent those and make some money passively.
Sites like Turo is a great place to list your car for rent. This site helps you to rent out your car, and when anyone rents your car, it will manage the further activities.

5. Savings Accounts:
Investing in savings accounts might be the lowest-earning potential passive income stream. But this is one of the easiest and safest ways of earning passive income.

6. Start A Blog:
Blogging is one of the best ways to generate passive income. There are lots of ways to monetize a blog such as Advertising, Affiliate links, Sponsored posts, course, eBooks, etc. 
As you might know, blogging isn’t a short term money-making system. It will take time to roll money for you. 

Blogging requires some serious time and effort upfront. You’ll be going through building a blog, growing it, writing some useful articles, and building your brand. But at the end of time, you will be worthy of receiving all the benefits from your blog.

If you’re thinking about the investment to run a blog, then the biggest investment is your time and efforts compared to money. Because it will cost you around a few bucks a month to run a blog. 

7. Create An Online Course:
If you really want to make passive income with your short term of hard work, then creating an online course would be an excellent option for you. 
The best part of having a digital product is that you will not need to create the product again and again.

So if you have knowledge about any topic and can create a course, then combine all your pieces about that topic and compile a valuable online course.

Once you’ve created the course, you can sell it on Udemy.

Udemy is one of the largest marketplaces for buying, selling, and streaming digital courses.

8. Design And Sell T-Shirts:
There are lots of sites like Teespring and Amazon Merch, where you can design T-shirts or upload your artwork. Then they do the rest of the work from printing to delivering those T-shirts. 
As you guys know, how big Amazon is right now, it’s getting millions of active users every month. So if you get invited from Amazon Merch, then there is a glorious opportunity to get reach out to a huge number of people instantly. 

Teespring helps to create your own online store that you can use as your merchandise store. To earn from Teespring, you will need a marketing strategy to get traffic and sales.

9. Upload Videos On Youtube:
As blogging Youtube is another long term income generating system. That requires lots of hard work upfront for a long time before rolling cash.
If you’re creative enough to make videos that are interesting, entertaining, or educating people, then Youtube is the platform for you to play around.
This is the second-largest search engine and the biggest video content platform, which means it has enough potential so you can generate a significant amount of money with it.

Youtube has a benchmark of 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours within a year, before start monetizing your channel. And for crossing that benchmark, you have to produce quality content consistently.

From an earnings perspective, there are many ways to earn from a Youtube channel, from advertising to sponsored posts.

10. Affiliate Marketing:
Affiliate marketing is a process of referencing third-party’s products and getting rewarded if any sales will perform through your referral link.
There are plenty of affiliate networks you can join and start promoting their products. Some popular once are Amazon Associates, eBay Partners, ShareASale, and ClickBank.

For making money with affiliate marketing, you need traffic on your affiliate offers, and here you can consider your blog, website, social media, or anything like these. 

11. Social Media Influencer:
Do you want to make money literally posting stuff on your social media?
There are lots of companies that hire social media influencers for promoting their products.
Social media influencers get paid anywhere from $100 to $300 for just one sponsored post. This price range may vary according to your following and engagement rates.

For making this happen, you need a well-grown social page or account. It could be your Instagram page, Twitter account, or Youtube channel. And for growing your social media, you have to be consistent, posting relevant content, according to your social media’s niche.

12. Create An eBook:
Creating and publishing an eBook would be a great idea to make passive income. 
If you have something exciting or relatively problem-solving, which you can transform into an eBook, then there is a great chance to make money passively. 

For creating an eBook, you need to write it, edit it, creating a cover for it, and publish it on sites like Amazon kindle.

13. Create An App:
This can be a techy thing because creating an app isn’t easy unless you’re a programmer. But if you’re not a programmer, who doesn’t know anything about programming and coding stuff, then you can hire someone on Fiverr who will do the job done for you.
Creating an app can be a great way to make passive income. You can create an app literally about anything. So if you have any idea for your app, then there are two ways to make money with it. First, you can set a price for using your app, and second, you can monetize it by displaying ads.

14. Sell Digital Products on Etsy:
If you ever buy any product on Etsy, then you definitely know it is a huge marketplace for handmade products. You can find a variety of handmade and crafted items on Etsy.
Selling digital products is one of the ways to make money with Etsy. There are also numbers of digital products, such as Printable arts, Stickers, Digital planners, etc.

So if you have some graphic designing skills, then you can design those kinds of digital products and sell them on Etsy. This could be an excellent opportunity to make passive income.

Etsy charges a significantly lower percentage of your sales than other eCommerce platforms. And it is pretty good from an earnings point of view.

15. Domain Flipping:
Domain flipping is kind like a process of purchasing and selling domain names. It’s is one of the methods where you can make higher profits with lower investments. 
The concept of domain flipping is finding and purchasing hot domains at least amount of money, and sell those domains at higher prices.  

Sites like Flippa is a great platform for selling domain names, and you can use GoDaddy for finding and purchasing domain names.

16. Sell Stock Images:
If you’re passionate about photography or you just like clicking pictures, then there is a way to earn some money out of it.
You can sell your pictures as stock images on sites like iStock and Adobe Stock. 

When anyone uses your images, you will get paid. 

17. License Your Music:
Well, this is quite similar to selling stock images. Here you can license your music for using it. You’ll be get paid when someone uses that.",False,oiqvfi,Josephonrun,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oiqvfi/so_here_are_the_17_passive_income_ideas_2021_that/,7,1
2755,"My boss and colleagues were being unprofessional in interacting with me so I reported their behaviour to top management and threatened to leave because it's causing me stress, I was showered with apologetic messages today","I work in an IT call center part-time as a student, I make right about enough to survive. I was put in a team with a lot of workload, very few people (because literally everyone keeps leaving), shitty and slow tools and equipment, and the overall setup of the agents in this team leads you go be unproductive in every way shape and form. It's truly painful. 

And this produces a very hostile work environment where your boss, your colleagues and everything in between have their knives out and are patiently waiting for someone to slip to lash on them with commands and what they did wrong. 

Coming from a much healthier environment with better people and tools, it felt like a downgrade, let alone my personality and not being able to take shit from everyone. I'd usually engage in lengthy conversations as to what they are doing is wrong because it feels like there's nothing better to do than putting people in their places in this bitch...etc especially with my boss. 

Last Friday I had enough. I wrote an email to management telling them how frustrating it's become and they either put me back somewhere else more productive with better people, warn my colleagues to start behaving professionally, or I might as well just leave. I sent him some evidence to the hostility I'm experiencing, and I know they won't fire me because they desperately need people.

I came in for my first day. Holy moly was it a sinking ship. Smelt like shit. Mind you this is a pizza restaurant. Every employee working there literally looked so lifeless, they used dishes that weren't even sanitized because they ran out of sanitizing wash. 

I am then told that apparently some nights, you don't even receive the tip money you earned during your shift. And instead have to wait and receive it in your check. Typically you're supposed to get it at the end of your shift.

The place is literally filthy, so of course that affects the food. I am then told that there's practically no actual break. ""You take it whenever"" I guess, though it doesn't really happen since you have to stay ""busy"" since there's ""no breaks"" even if you're working over 5 hours.

Then, the person I close with, asks for a ride. Which is fine, I don't mind it. But then, my car don't start. It sucks. I hate it.

I was paid £5.50 to do the same job as the adults that were paid £9.00.

I’d have serious anxiety every Friday night, knowing I had to go in. The work was hard (mean customers, mean boss, heavy lifting) and it really took its toll on my mental health.

The final straw for me was on a rainy day. I used to walk to work, and of course my boots would get a little dirty. When the cleaner was mopping the floors, they’d lay out cardboard for us to walk on- but only on some parts of the floor. Well, the part that didn’t have it was the part I had to walk on to serve a customer.

The mud came off my boots and dirtied the floor. My supervisor started calling me names and shouting about me to the cleaner. They’d pass by me and make passive aggressive remarks.

1. Human Resources -- might need one or two people-managing-people, but there are too many and they are primarily concerned with protecting the company.
2. Some lawyers. This is a hard one, but I feel that rationalizing the tax code could make many tax lawyers unnecessary overnight.
3. Greeters at Walmart etc. I don't see how they even help the company, let alone society at large.
4. Loss Prevention personnel. There would be no shoplifting (or close to none) if there was no poverty.
5. Police in general, for the same reason. Not all police are useless, but their numbers could be reduced with decent welfare programs.
6. Some CEOs and other executives are completely useless. Others are useful for the company but not really useful to anyone else.
7. Most taxi drivers / Uber not-employees would be obsoleted by decent public transit.
8. Chauffeurs, personal chefs, and other jobs that exist as status symbols for the rich.
9. Lobbyists are not ""useless"" *per se*, but they are the product of a broken political system and only serve to perpetuate it, even when they push good policies.
10. It varies by company, but many middle managers are of severely limited utility; they might only accomplish a few hours' worth of necessary work a week.
11. Management consultants. I have heard countless stories of consultants either doing nothing useful or stating the obvious and being ignored. I have never heard of one who improved efficiency at anything.
12. Secret shoppers and other jobs that only exist because companies do not trust their own employees.
13. High-frequency traders.
14. Everyone working in the poverty-exploitation industry: payday loans, debt buyers, etc.

2791,The middle class doesn't exist,"t helps to realize there is no ""middle class"" economically.  This has several ramifications.

The ""middle class"" in your perception may imply some sort of ""averageness"" in that it is ""average size"".  The mental implication of calling something the ""middle"" is that there is around 33% low class people, 33%middle class people, and 33% high class people.

This is false, in fact the average person in the ""first world"" sits in a class of around the top 10% of people in the world.  This is  an average, though, and wealth inequality is much greater in ""first world"" countries, however the ""middle class"" in your perception is a vanishingly small number of people.

The ""middle class"" is a buffer class, that is put in the ""middle"" of the large mass of working class people and the ridiculously small ruling and owning class.  This has two purposes.  By standing in what appears to be the ""middle"" of economic accomplishment, they inspire the lower classes to work harder and achieve a ""middle class"" existence.  The buffer is also a defense for the upper classes, in that the middle class is kept just comfortable enough that they are unlikely to attack the upper classes and hurt their place in society, and are likely to even fight and die to uphold the system that oppresses them.",False,oir3o5,capnbarky,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oir3o5/the_middle_class_doesnt_exist/,16,1

2802,"Work is destroying my personality and turning me into a robot, what do I do?","I've been working at a warehouse for about 2 months now, and I feel myself becoming less of the person that I was before I started working there. Everyday, it feels like I loose brain cells as I do the same mind numbing thing for 12 HOURS a day (whoever thought that 12 hour shifts were a good idea seriously needs to reconsider their whole life) whilst being forced to listen to a stupid radio station with its overly cheerful and fake presenters who absolutely love to play overplayed pop songs (we can't listen to our own music, which I find really annoying, and there's not much I can do other than to listen to the radio so that I don't have to think about my physical health going down the drain).

I can barely enjoy the 3-4 glorious days off that I get in a week because it involves me trying to decompress from my job only to mentally and physically prepare to go to work again (as well as waking up at the crack of dawn (usually at 5am) just to push a stupid trolley about so that I can make a bunch of impulse buyers (that I'll probably never see) happy with their items for like 5 minutes).

I can barely form a coherent thought anymore (even writing this post feels hard, although I used to enjoy writing one way or another), my attention span has gone down the drain (thanks to the fact that we have to be ~efficient~ all the time; even when I was an avid mainstream social media user (i.e. using Instagram all the time), I had a better attention span and could at least do things without losing my concentration for a while) along with my short term memory as I'm starting to forget things a lot more often now, and I barely have the energy or headspace to actively enjoy my hobbies anymore, not to mention that work has literally invaded my dreams and all I get now are dreams that are somewhat related to work instead of the weird and wonderful dreams that I used to have.

I still haven't acknowledged the fact that I'm now 20, despite celebrating my birthday last month although I had to end it abruptly because I had to go to work the next day and didn't get to enjoy it as much as I wanted to (the day itself was fine, but when the evening rolled around, I started to become on edge). On top of that, I always feel anxious the night before I have to go work and knowing that I'm going to be rudely woken up by my alarm at 5am, to the point where I've tried to speedrun my sleep so that I'm awake before my alarm.

It feels like I've become a robot who only knows how to navigate a warehouse and that's it. I've become another cog in the machine (which is my worst nightmare and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy) and a part of the army of zombie robot penguins that all mechanically march out of the warehouse just after 6pm only to come back just before 6am the next day to do the same mindless drivel for 12 hours. The days where I work feel wasted, like I've been in a coma, since I have nothing to show for them, and the worst bit is that I don't even get a glimpse to see the fruits of my labour.

I've practically lost my personality (not to mention the amount of insane numbing headaches that I get, which last for days at a time) and I really do not enjoy work at all, so I'm surprised that I've managed to stick it out for 2 months. I've gone past the point of caring and my mindset now is ""fire me, I dare you"" because I absolutely hate being another cog in the machine since it's made me downright miserable, not to mention the amount of times that I've come home from work and tried my best not to cry tears of boredom and stress.

I have no other alternative since most people my age have jobs and I don't want to spend the summer sat at home when I could be getting the all important work experience as well as money, and I'm struggling to find another job. So, what should I do?

Railyard worker, where he worked 68 hours a week with no breaks and was picked apart by higher ups when he had a slight injury. 

Current job: Ice Delivery Man. 

Was told to expect a lot of overtime (that's cool). 

Normal day: 7-3:30 (gets paid time and a half for overtime)

Working consistent 10 hour days 6 days a week (can handle that when there's an end in near aka end of the summer, when they return to regular hours). 

Averages 10 stops a day, but can't get them all done because he doesn't carry enough ice on his truck for them.

Here's the issue: He is given a basic truck with no lift gate, hand pump jack, etc, while everyone else gets trucks with lift gates, electric jacks, etc. Then he's given the longest routes (all empty ice boxes, up to 21 stops a day, each box taking between 30mins to 1 hour without the fancy equipment.) When he gets back to the plant, everyone else is done and left or there are one or two guys still on the road (but they have bigger trucks that can hold more ice and have to drive further). 

He had his first day off in 2 weeks yesterday (usually has off Sundays, but the 4th of July is their busiest day) and today they hit him with a 17 stop route with boxes that are all empty and still no truck with a lift gate, electric jack. When he expressed concern he's told to suck it up and get ALL OF THE STOPS DONE today. Normally, they tell him that he can stop once his truck empties. He already refilled once today.

2807,I quit and then looked up the job description my boss posted for my role - lies and lols,"Apart from the misleading job description, the “INCENTIVES” section is what really got me.

TLDR the “incentives” were exaggerated or completely untrue. The poor sucker who will get this job - we’ll see how long they last 

Lies and Lols included:
- Saying it’s an 8hr work shift, when it’s really 9hrs. Yes we are supposed to get a 1hr lunch, but my boss never respects it and regardless you’re on site for 9hrs 
- Saying the dress code is casual…uhhh everyone hear wears blazers, dress pants, collared shirts, work shoes/heels…poor new person is gonna show up and be so underdressed!! 
- The health benefits here are very basic, even Starbucks part time had more coverage. Health benefits should have been one point on the “Incentives” section (even though it should just be a given) but my boss stretched it out to FIVE POINTS worded 5 different ways 
- Saying we have company events. Very misleading. We don’t have fun days or outings, even without COVID. We have 1 paid lunch a year and it’s a work lunch that just results in more to-dos 
- Free parking! Our office is in the suburbs where parking can be found ANYWHERE as far as the eye can see. This isn’t some crowded downtown area. Idk I found this so funny that it was a “perk” 
- The kicker for me - my boss is notorious for their broken promises. One thing they’ve been promising to continue is WFH Flexibility, even after COVID. I knew this wouldn’t be kept because they personally HATE WFH due to their micromanaging tendencies. And behold, the job description says NO REMOTE WORK

Anyways I’m thankful to be DONE here within the next few days. I was nervous to quit but I feel no ounce of regret. To all those job seeking right now - keep on keeping on!

2812,I quit!,"A lot of you saw my comments here about the nursing facility where I've been working full time and the absolutely horrible conditions there. Well, I just emailed my boss and told her I'm going down to part time weekend overnights only effective immediately. I have been working a combination of evening and night shift because they gave my FT nights away to someone else, we are woefully understaffed on evenings so they ""need"" me, and it's an absolute shit show, I cry every single day. I have been working  2 pm-6am multiple days in a row and sleeping in the facility in between, working as both a CNA and LPN desperately trying to make sure these residents were getting the care they needed because they cannot keep this place staffed with how little they offer employees. It drove me to a nervous breakdown this weekend and I decided tonight that enough is enough.

Nights is where I started and it's absolutely my jam! There isn't shit to do and no one there to make me work, it's sincerely one of the best antiwork job out there. For the most part they sleep and I have a good 7 hours to do whatever I want. When I was doing full time nights I was so creative, writing a novel and honing my art skills, something I was thinking about starting a commission based business I could work on in my downtime there. So that's the plan now, and I will not be doing jack shit for this company beyond the bare minimum required of me. Of course I will continue to be a good nurse for my residents but I'm not taking on anymore extra work, it's not in my job description and their self inflicted cluster fuck is officially no longer my problem.

I'm a little scared about giving up my hours but I just signed on with an agency where I would be making at least 8 more an hour, depending on the facility even double what I'm making here. They would probably be trainwreck assignments but I can handle one of those a week if I have my chill nights back. I won't cross a strike line, to be clear, ever, and I will choose assignments based on how workers and patients are treated. In this market and with the current nursing shortage I can absolutely afford to be picky. 

 I still plan on contacting a union rep this week and working to organize my workplace, now I'll just be able to do it from a safe detached distance where they won't know what I'm up to. But for the time being I'm going to use this dead end job for what it's good for, which is giving me a night shift where I can be left the fuck alone. Their waking hours clusterfuck of a dumpster fire is officially no longer my problem!

2837,I've been loving pitting employers against each other just for the fun of it.,"I've been in the process of asking for a raise at work so I decided to apply for 30 jobs in my area in my field of expertise just to see what would happen. Of those dirty jobs I got 10 call backs and six interviews. I've been to three interviews mostly because I'm bored but I have to say getting to that point in the interview where you're asking how much you're going to be paid I'm just flat-out telling them to their face ""well I make more than that at my current job and I've had job offers for more per hour than that. I know I'm worth at least $17.50/hr so you can start there and compete up if you want me to work for you"" has been a blast. 

The look on these people's faces when they realize that I am an informed worker who is just going to flat-out refuse them if they don't offer me way more than they want to pay is what are the most satisfying work-related feelings I've had in ages. You get them to either squirm and offer you more money to which you reply with ""that works. Let me have a day to think it over and I'll call you back asap"". Then you leave them in the lurch and don't return the call. Twice now I've had them call me several times for the next week asking if I am going to be taking the job and I just let it go to voicemail. 

Even better is when they get mad and indignant that you're asking for more money than they want to pay so you get to reply with ""I'm sorry but let me stop you there, based on your hostile attitude towards me, a perspective employee, I have determined that this isn't a good work environment for me. I want to work in a place that respects their employees and clearly you don't so I'm going to have to turn down this job offer"" and watch them shit themselves in rage that you are turning down there table scraps when they expect you to be a humble subservient worker drone. 

Granted I'm not applying to any place that I actually want to work oh, I'm just throwing stuff out into an industry that I know is desperate for workers but treats people terribly (retail/ and hospitality).

2856,What would you do if you were me.,"Im in my mid-late 20s and currently work in IT making under 60 k a year. I have been blessed to have zero debts and 100k in savings. I currently work remotely but I believe my employer wants us back in the office by the end of the year.  My job is unique since It is shift based work but yet also remote at this time. I work during the day time 60% of the time and I drudge along during that time and thats when I feel stressed.  40% of the time I am put on night shift, which I absolutely LOVE. The reason I love night shift is since my work load drastically decreases and I only have 1 meeting per week when im on night shift. This gives me time to do stuff I find entertaining like listening to audiobooks.

My company also has a part time vacancy for someone to work the weekends for $24 an hour, I have reason to suspect this position will stay remote. I  also am blessed to get over 4k usd per year based on investments my grandparents in India have made in the names of their children and grand children. 

Currently I am pretty unhappy in the united states. I have no friends in the state I currently live in. The few friends from college im still in contact with live in other states and I have no desire to reconnect with them. My value system is different from theirs and it seems like the only thing they like to do in their free time is drink in bars/clubs. I have been a teetotaler since late 2018.  I also lost my desire to climb the corporate ladder when I became 'awoke' to the idea of the demise of industrial society happening within my lifetime. 

I dont know what to do. I have this idea that quitting my job and leaving the United States will make me happy but i second guess this notion a lot and think that I will be just as miserable overseas and poorer.

I was thinking of requesting my employer to allow me to 'demote' myself into the weekend position and work remotely from overseas. Theres a lot I want to do abroad . If covid dies down I want to spend time with my grandparents in India.  I have a friend in  Albania whose family has a farm that I have been invited to visit, I would like to try my hand at the farming lifestyle. I want to travel and visit other places.

But I keep second guessing myself thinking, If i quit my job/ demote myself  to go abroad I will just be poorer and be as miserable as I am in the states. Another thing that stops me from quitting is that I will have another resume gap, which will make it harder for me to find my next job. I had a resume gap in the past and it took forever for me to find my next job (the current job I have). I had a lot of anxiety during this period of unemployment despite have a safety net of savings (back then my savings were 20k).

If I provide you with facts that destroy those particular notions, how could you possibly still cling to them if you’re a rational being? I wish I could delude and sedate myself just like the rest of the world and continue on, but I find it impossible.  Life, as it is now, just doesn’t seem worth living, and that’s not suicidal ideation. The state of the world is genuinely depressing, yet most seem content to maintain the status quo.

Do you vent somewhere, like this sub, or other forums with like-minded users? That sounds great in theory, but I usually end up becoming even more upset with the new facts I learn.

2884,making people you dislike rich,"i think one of my biggest problems isn't that i'm making someone else rich with my labor. it isn't that someone else is in a higher position than i am. it isn't even a hatred of wealth on its own.

it's that pretty much everyone i have worked for has been a piece of shit.

if my boss was a generally nice person who actually cared about other people, and my well being, i wouldn't have a problem with knowing my labor was making him money. in fact, it might even motivate me.

the problem is that people who become wealthy do so by being narcissistic sociopaths. the less you seem to care about cutting the throat of others the more money you are able to make. a conscience holds you back from your true earning potential.

the worst bosses are people who think they can talk down to you as if they are your parents. especially when they know they're paying you much less than you deserve. they walk all over people, and when those people have finally had enough, they just find someone else to sucker in with initial fake kindness.",False,oj5gr5,bastinald,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oj5gr5/making_people_you_dislike_rich/,16,1

2890,I started a new job today and I feel so dreadful about it,"In November 2020 I quit my full time salaried job because I felt that it was crushing my soul and taking way too much of my time. I had really bad insomnia and I was basically sleeping 3-5 hours a night and barely functioning. 

I started doordashing full time and I liked it for a while until about May when it started to really slow down and I was having trouble working part time and still paying my bills, so I begrudgingly applied for other jobs and decided to just suck it up a get a career. 

I managed to land what any normal person would consider a “dream job” with my city. I don’t believe in the concept but when I told my dad he was so proud and acted like I had just become a doctor or something. The pay is great, especially long term, the benefits are completely unmatched, some of the best in my entire state! I can retire at age 55 with an AMAZING pension. Everyone there seems so nice, the job doesn’t seem too hard.

But something about going there for 8+ hours every day is just filling me with such horrible feelings of dread and depression. I don’t know how I’m supposed to do it for 30 years. Even 10 hours less a week and I could potentially see myself being happy.

I love it’s natural beauty, but it is mostly a county of old white people. There are some biotech industries and hospitals, but I would assume most of the populace works from home or service jobs. 

Sadly, I could never afford to live here on my own, so I have to live with my parents indefinitely while I work locally. Most of the apartments are either overpriced or decrepit. 

I feel spoiled to admit I’ve never lived in an apartment my entire life (mental health problems.) 

To cope I have committed myself to full time work. I might go back to part-time but soon realize I need as much money as possible to survive this sad life. I want to leave America, but that would fix anything unless I have sufficient “fuck you” money

2901,"Already a Wage Slave, Now I'm a slave to Google Reviews?","Got an email from management that the company received two one-star reviews.

Keep in mind, any asshole off the street can leave a Google review. 

Now, I had been trying to grow in this company. I did more work than is my job - mainly because it's the work I'd rather be doing. It's work that is someone else's, but that someone else is way overworked (and underpaid). I've been helping out, because this work is something that someone should be giving 100% of their attention to. It takes a lot of energy to do main duties AND this work. 

In this company they like to say that ""everyone wears many hats around here"" 🚩. So I've been wearing this goddamned hat also, and asked weeks ago if they could just hire a PT replacement for the menial tasks I do and let me take this work on full-time from home. I said that since they're a growing company, they need the extra staff to be effective. I'm really good at this job, I don't hate it like my current duties.
""We'll talk in the future"". Never did. I've still been helping out, hoping they'll see the merits of my point. 

Now this Google bullshit.

""All the hard work we did to get 4 stars and it's been wiped out by these two one star reviews overnight.""

Yeah, almost like it doesn't fucking matter? Employers care more about some dipshit review than what their own employees are telling them they need. 

""How can we work so that this doesn't happen?""

So I let management know -- Reply All -- that it was my fault. Because I'd gotten so wrapped up in helping out with this other work, I neglected my own duties. And how it's easy to get wrapped up in this other work because we're understaffed. And how this isn't an isolated issue, it's actually affecting multiple facets of the business. But that from now on that person whose work it is, is on their own and I'll just go back to focusing on my own work. And *only* my own work.

Which means they just lost a bunch of extra free labor over this one star bullshit. 
It's not just that they care about the ratings. It's not that they wanted to point out places we could improve but they recognize how hard we work. It's the bullshit ""what can we do"" attitude - when the answer is the same one repeated over and over. Hire more people. But they want the answer to be 'oh no, oh I'm so sorry I'll work harder to wear more hats and do everything to the liking of any asshole on the street'.

2937,Should I quit my job over being “asked” to work as a scab?,"Burner account cause job controversy... I work as an electrical engineer at a major automotive company in the US. The local UAW chapter has been on strike for nearly a month and clearly the company is desperate to get vehicles off the line. I have been “asked” to travel to the plant ASAP to begin training to work on the assembly line as a scab. Engineers are not unionized at my company. UAW corruption notwithstanding, I believe it is morally reprehensible to be a picket line crosser and I am shaking with anger that I am being “asked” to cross the line. I say “asked” because it is clearly a thinly veiled threat of termination if I refuse. Or at the very least I’ll be labeled as uncommitted or unfaithful to the company. 

I enjoy my job and the personal growth of learning to design complex systems that comes with it. That’s why I took the job. Not that I don’t appreciate the hard work that people do on the assembly line, but that’s not what I was hired to do. I am doubtful that a two day crash course on the assembly line will adequately prepare me to do the job safely. 
On the one hand I feel very privileged that I am given good benefits (health,PTO,401k) by the company. On the other hand I feel shitty that the company does not extend these privileges to the people who actually assemble our product. 
Sorry about this disjointed post, I’m drunk and angry at my company for putting me and all of my colleagues and the unionized employees in this position.

2955,"7, this rule is so underrated, keep your family and business completely separated","I'm so fucking done.

I'm a Business Trainee. It's essentially a paid internship where by the end of my 12 month contract, I'll have a business qualification. I was hired by the employment centre that runs my traineeship and they've placed me in a fucking squalor. It's a family run roof-racking business managed by three bothers -- The Manager (the eldest), The Orders Man (the middle brother), and The Fitter (the youngest). Additionally, their bat-shit mother at aged 70+ also works here. There are only three of us who are non-familial employees -- The Apprentice (also an employee at the employment centre I'm employed by), The Phone Man (a retail salesman guy who answers many of our phone calls and works in the shop), and me. 

And my God, that one lyric from the Ten Crack Commandments could never be more true. Biggie knew some wise shit.

I haven't worked much in my 24 years alive. I didn't start working until I was out of high school due to school commitments and wanting to get into uni, though that never worked out, so I threw myself into full time. I've only ever had two full time jobs and the last one was also a traineeship that ended badly due to negligence from the host company I was at (ironic). And the second is where I am now, which I've somehow miraculously managed to not slit my wrists through after being here for 7 months. The rest have been casual stints that never lasted long due to lack of hours or I was a Christmas Casual.

I have never worked in such a disrespectful workplace. I have never worked in such a toxic environment where this family cares nada about their employees. Want to go on leave, even when you have enough? I don't think so, because we don't have enough staff because these fuckers keep dragging their heels. The Phones Guy wanted to take a week off for school holidays so he can spend time with his kids. What does The Manager do? ""No, I need you, a week is too long. I'll give you Friday and Saturday off."" Is this illegal? Pretty sure it is. I'm just lucky that these wankers aren't my true employers because then I'd never get leave despite being full entitled to it like The Phones Guy.

The family fights all the time. There are literal screaming matches, all caused by The Fitter who is essentially a man child throwing a tanty when things don't go his way. The Mother is always on The Fitter's side, basically being very combative against The Orders Man and The Manager -- her own sons -- making the situation worse. The screaming and swearing is so loud that you can hear it from upstairs, and there have been many instances where customers in the showroom upstairs can hear the screaming matches. How do I know they can hear it? Oh, well, it's clearly displayed on their faces as their eyes widen in shock. It's embarrassing to say the least. Every single one of these people have a screw loose, some more than others. Not just that, these people are so disrespectful to customers. It baffles me that these people made over a million dollars in profit last year and yet the rudeness they exhibit to customers who have knowledge of the industry is baffling. It's always to people that know some or even equal to them on product knowledge, so it's like they're threatened by this or something.

The Manager is an asshole. He's supposed to be training me as my host employer and as a trainee myself. Does he do that? Nah. So I have to go around blindly trying to teach myself, which obviously means I'm going to make mistakes. And when I do make these mistakes, I get talked down to -- I guess even mansplained -- which can be easily avoided if I was fucking taught how to do shit! The Manager is snappy, talks to me disrespectfully, and clearly doesn't trust me because every phone call I answer he hovers over me like a helicopter parent. After 7 months, he does not trust me. Do I blame him for that? Yes, because I have if I was trained properly, YOU'D BE ABLE TO FUCKING TRUST ME! When The Manager is stressed, he takes it out on me through snappy remarks, eye rolling, cutting me off during explanations and just in general disrespect, therefore completely not incentivising me to want to ask for help. I hate asking him for help from him, but I never have a choice because I know nothing about this industry nor have I been taught properly. Rather, when I do ask for help, I get sarcastic replies, complete disrespect, and he makes me feel stupid for asking anything at all. 

The Orders Man is no better I'm not a graphic artist, but I have a bit of experience doing it for my own small business, but when I've made stuff for him with little to no idea on what he wants -- so I ask questions, get very vague answers, so I just freely assume what he'd like -- he never gives me constructive criticism. Rather, his replies are usually, ""what's this shit around here?"" or ""I don't like this shit"". Majority of the time, it's just, ""figure it out for yourself"". Well, okay, I'll do that. ""What the fuck is this? I didn't ask for this"". Well, cunt, maybe give me MORE OF A FUCKING IDEA OF WHAT YOU WANT NEXT TIME! He's asked me what I think, I tell him and always finish with ""whatever you want, I'll make it"", which I get an eye roll for. Well, what do you want me to say?! When I do what I think, it's ""shit"". When I do what you think, it's still ""shit"". I've sat next to this motherfucker as he's thrown the phone receiver at his desk -- like, full-on hurled it -- while the customer was STILL ON THE LINE. He calls everyone who calls into the store wanting questions answered ""dumb cunts"" and things similar, and he swears every sentence, even to customers. I don't have a problem with that. I swear every sentence too (not at work, though, since it's supposed to be a *professional environment* apparently). What I do have a problem with is calling my work ""shit"" when if more directives were given, it wouldn't be ""shit"". Oh, also, this asshole has made fun of my math skills on more than one occasion. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry that my math isn't that great, but I'M NOT A FUCKING ACCOUNTANT! I'm a BUSINESS ADMIN TRAINEE. I do OFFICE WORK, not NUMBER WORK. 

Ironically, despite having the most screws loose, The Fitter is the nicest out of the three. He's never gotten angry at me, is never snappy or mean, he's always been very cordial and nice. He's had a tanty and then I've talked to him a bit later and he's always nice despite previous events. I don't respect him, though. I respect no one here.

The Mother is just a weird creature. She comes in at 6am every work day despite us opening at 8:15am and fucks around in the workshop for ages. And she doesn't use deodorant. My god, the smell, it's terrible. She comes into the office sometimes to count the money to take to the bank, and I have to hold my breath and breathe shallowly every time she sits across from me, it's that bad. In winter -- which it is now -- she's not that bad, but when it was summer in December? It was absolutely putrid. I have a horse and even he and his shit doesn't smell has bad as what this mother stinks of. 

I fully regret not complaining to my supervisor of the employment centre earlier. At least, I regret not properly complaining and demanding a transfer. I've complained about this treatment before and asked to be transferred about 4 months in, but got persuaded to stay and give The Manager and his team a chance since I got dumped here at an erratic time. Essentially, I was asked to be patient. Well, it's been 7 months and nothing has fucking changed. It's gotten worse, even. I have no incentive to work for these people because of the disrespect. I have no drive to do my job because of the constant nasty criticism and snappy replies. I don't have any wish to work here when these people are stressed, because it's like walking on eggshells and I have to crack one because, whether I like it or not, I have to ask for help and then I get bashed with words. I hate it here and I want out. The qualification isn't even worth it anymore. I never go home happy. I never come to work happy. Mondays are days I dread. I'm depressed. I do the best I can, I do everything I'm asked, I'm a fucking doormat for these assholes and I'm done. I can't do it anymore. 

My supervisor comes in once a month to visit and see how I'm going and to talk to The Manager about my ""progress"". This time, I'm telling her everything. I'm laying all my cards on the table. And, this time, I'm giving her an ultimatum -- you transfer me to somewhere better, healthier, more professional, and somewhere where I'll actually be trained or I'm walking. I'd rather be unemployed than work here. The qualification is simply not worth it. I'll be grilled about why I didn't say anything much earlier, and all I can say is that I've been patient and I've tried giving these people a chance. And there's nothing to show for that. I'm done.

2958,Full time should be 30 hours/week and OT should be expensive.,"I feel like the 40 hour work week used to seem reasonable because when it was instituted, there wasn't nearly as much to do besides work, sleep, and put up with your family.  I imagine more than a few workers went to work just to escape screaming child hell.  Nowadays there is too much going on and 8 hour shifts don't leave enough time to attend to it all and still be able to rest or do something because it's fun instead of because you have to.

Also, real wages used to be a lot higher (because the dollar was more valuable), so while you'd work your 8 and be tired at the end of it, the pay you got was actually decent so being tired didn't feel quite so bad.  It was a lot more worth it.  Compare to now, where we're exhausted after working 8, and the pay you get is barely enough to get by and you're constantly having to scrimp, and scrape, and cut budget.  It feels so bad. 

My paycheck would be much more reasonable if shifts were 6 hours instead of 8.   After 5 to 6 hours at work I start to feel really trapped.  Going in knowing that I'll be stuck there for 8 isn't a very happy thought either.  The worst shifts are the ones where were busys/slammed and it feels like it MUST have been at least an hour, maybe two, because we're doing so much... look at the wristwatch and nope, 5 minutes.  And again, more being busy, HAS to have been at least an hour, nope, 5 minutes.  If the who shift is like that, it's incredibly painful and by the time we finally get down to 2 hours left, it feels like we've been trapped in the building for days.

It's a lot different when it's a 6 hour shift, because (at least for me) it's like ""eh, I don't really want to go but it's only 6 hours so that's not too bad.""  There's still time to get things done and not have to run my ass off after running it off at work.

Lastly, overtime needs a reform.  If full time is 30 hours, then 30+ to 40 should be time-and-a-half (1.5x), 40+ to 50 should be double time (2x), and 50+ should be triple time (3x).  Also, the law should set a limit of 5 working days in a row max, if the employer requires more than that then the 6th day would be 1.5x (whole shift), day 7 would be 2x, day 8 would be 3x, day 9 would be 4x, and so on, and those modifiers would stack multiplicative with over-hours OT modifiers.  Third shift?  All work done after 11pm and before 8am should be 1.5x, stacking with all other modifiers.

People always say the same thing to me when I suggest this: ""That won't work!  The companies can't afford that!  They'll go out of business and then you'll be out of a job!""  They're right about one thing, the companies can't afford that, but they won't go out of business.  They'll stop forcing the overtime.  I don't want to see such a draconian OT reform to make wages higher, or to cost companies money.  I want to see it to kill off OT in general, just get rid of it.

Lastly, lunches need to be paid, no more ""8 hour"" shifts that are really 8.5 hours because lunch isn't paid.  Your commute mileage should be paid because we're putting wear and tear on our own cars so that the fat-ass, overpaid, overstuffed CEO can buy a new boat every year, and car repairs are expensive.  The employer should have to cover that.  Driving is a miserable experience on top of that, and it's a misery we're not being paid for, we're PAYING for it.

2960,quit my retail job today and it went ugly,"my job was ugly before, for example they told us not to get tested when covid started, so we still have enough workers. There were a lot more health risk issues before, but, let that one sink in. 

I was blind and trusting, and let myself be manipulated even before this job. I'm 33 and have reoccurring panic attacks, burn out and was in therapy before because of it and of course, I hoped it would get better. 

We are chronically understaffed since 2 years and every schedule switches constantly, everyone is expected to hop in whenever at this point-get a call at 11AM, be there at 2PM. We weren't paid what we deserved- when covid came they made huge profit, and cut our pay. I'm still not convinced it was legal. 


When I told them today that I'll quit, they showed every bad trait available. Bosses went angry at me first, ranting to me ""no one here holds together, no team feel, and when things just get a little bit bad people quit""- and left me standing there.
She and my other boss later tried to talk me out of it,  not with offering anything though, no. They ""chatted"" in front of me about how everywhere else it is the same bad circumstances, yet trying to tell me that, right here, it is still so much better than anywhere else and that I am very valuable to them. 

Later in my shift, one of them tried to get me with fear of  future since they know about it, talked about tight money, and how people without a job get treated badly, get sent to far districts and what not. They both tried bit more later on, knowing I'm in bad mental shape, trying to get me there. 

All I have to say about that, is, I  can't believe that I trusted these people and went along for so long. 
I'm going to get myself mental help and then see what my better options are.

2963,22 and Broken (big rant),"I’m so tired. I’m so unbelievably tired. I’m writing this with borderline tears in my eyes because I just need to get these feelings outside of myself and into the world. My fiancé and I (unintentionally) had a child when we were 21. Idgaf what you think but you’re still a kid pretty much at that age. I did the right thing. I worked 2 jobs (construction+EMT)+Ubering at night to get some money together for us. Neither of us come from families with lots of money. I dropped out of community college at 20, I have nothing more than a highschool diploma. I thought I had made it for a while, I worked as an Environmental Health and Safety specialist at the last aluminum plant on the west coast.. Intalco Alcoa. I made ok money and I didn’t have the sinking anxiety feeling in my stomach every time I swiped my card at the register. But still.. I couldn’t afford to take much time off work when my daughter came. I feel so ashamed of that. The look my fiancé gave me before I left for work after only a week and a half off was of sheer panic and anxiety. It’ll haunt me forever. Then the plant shut down. Over 1000 people lost their job over the course of a few months. It was devastating. Now I do heavy construction and earth moving equipment repair for shit pay and am a part time firefighter for just about the same. I cannot remember the last time I’ve worked less than 76 hours a week. And normally it’s more. There’s only 1 day a week where I get to go into my daughters room and be the one to wake her up. I love it so much. But I’m instantly hit with the sadness of knowing I won’t have this moment for another week. Sometime it sickens me to think that a part of me is proud to be doing this. To be working so much. To be watching my daughter grow up over Snapchat videos, to be drained on my days off snd not the partner my fiancé needs. I’m not giving my family my best self because work takes it from me to feed the machine of capital. Idk how many young parents are on here but just know that you’re not alone in the struggle and all of the complications becoming a young parent brings. Capitalism is robbing my family of my best self and spitting out a husk of a man to go home to them every night.",False,ohz7e7,kswizzle11,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ohz7e7/22_and_broken_big_rant/,16,1

2967,I don’t want to work until I’m 70. Neither do any of you. Any options/ways out?,"I love this sub and think that most of us, regardless of background, agree on a lot- capitalism is broken, the system is fucked, the rich exploit the poor and middle class, working your ass off only puts money in the pockets of those above you, etc. But let’s be honest, the system isn’t getting overthrown in our lifetime. So what the fuck can be done?

I’ve got it better than most here. I’m white collar, I’m a fucking attorney. I’m 41 and still 2 years away from paying off my law school debt. I’ve lived below my means amd driven 15 year old cars to pay bills and $850 a month in student loans. I bought into the bullshit early on and worked my ass off. Late nights, weekends, on call, believing it would pay off. That carrot got dangled to 10 of us for one fucking partner spot. We kill ourselves and fought each other like feral cats while basically shoveling buckets of money into upper managements wallets. 

Fuck that. Not anymore. I’ve got 2 kids under 6. Could not afford to have kids any younger. My dad, grandpa, and great grandpa all died by 52. (49, 50 and 52). I’ll be damned if I’m going to miss my kids childhoods to slave away, getting paid a 10% of what my labor earns them. 

I’ve decided I’m out of the rat race by 52. A little over 10 years. I’m better off than many. Some retirement 401k type money but not enough to retire before my mid-60s at the earliest. 

What are the options? Suicides out. I like many things about living and after losing my dad at 13, not doing that to my kids. Retiring to a foreign country with a cheap cost of living? Investing? I don’t know enough to pick the next Apple or Amazon and besides fuck Wall Street. Plus I’m starting  too late to get the real benefits of compound interest.

I’m not creative enough to come up with a million $ idea. Lottery is a waste of money. I’ve settled on throwing some money into crypto but I admit to myself it’s a longshot. But I’ve got to have some hope to get out of bed in the morning. 

When they are older, I’m teaching my kids to go into a skilled trade with a union after high school, live like they are poor, don’t have kids and retire by 45.

2968,The machine is a wood chipper: A story.,"I had something sad happened Friday and I didn't realize it was still bothering me until tonight. I guess I'm looking for commiseration, empathy, maybe some shared stories (though certainly not unsolicited advice).

Here's the story. 

I went back to college in January of this year to try and find a new career path *chokes on buzz words*. 

One of the guys in my class today, was mentioning how he had started working a job recently and that he was exhausted all week from working 8 to 9 hour shifts on top of going to school full time.

He said that his workplace had been giving him too many hours and he was asking people's opinion on whether he should talk to them and let them know that it's too much for him, or wait it out (I later learned that it's a new job/ etc some other details, so the advice shift later once I knew that.... But here's how the convo that pulled my heart went).

I of course, being far older than the rest of the folks in the class, (they're 18 mostly, and I am decidedly a long way from that 😆) offered my own experience.

Essentially I said ""totally do whatever it is you need to do. And if you need to make the money, then by all means no judgment and do what you got to do. *But* if you have an option of financial stability some other way if you stand up for yourself....aka if you have a buffer ... I'd say to let them know. Because that's a lot of hours and working any job and being in school is a lot to deal with. You run out of time to person."" 

And the dude said ""Yeah I mean I don't have any time for myself anymore. I just go to school, go to work, sleep, and wake up and do the whole thing over again.""

My heart is already cracking a bit at this because this guy is so young and he doesn't realize this is the lie of adulthood. The one they don't tell you. You can't be anything you want. And shit is brutal more than is ever told to kids to prepare them.

So I said ""yeah man, you definitely need time to person. And like... Not everyone will agree with me on this, but not everyone can do the work and school thing. And the job will very likely push you because you're a young guy and....basically no one is going to look out for your physical or mental health but you so make sure that if you need to let them know, do.""

And this poor boy, my heart honestly broke

He goes. ""Yeah. Like I don't even have time to myself anymore, to be an 18 year old kid.""

And like, just the honesty of that was.... 

I mean the curmudgeon in me went ""oh the sweet flower still thinks 18 is a kid"" for a hot second. But I stopped and was like *woah there brain train. He's right.* And more importantly than ""right"" or not biologically or societally, *that's how he sees himself and feels*. And realizing he is so terribly unprepared for how brutal working customer service can be to your soul....and how I was also once that innocent and optimistic....

The machine is like a woodchipper for meat. 

And the meat is us.

Our hopes and dreams. 

Our sleep and social connections. 

Our ability to brain and not cry that it's Monday. 

It all goes to the meat chipper that is being forced to work; work or starve and be homeless; ""earn a living.""

I just.... Oof.

2983,Rant: Ignorance fuels capitalism,"It's amazing how out of touch some people are with reality. They literally don't seem to realize that capitalism isnt the only way. I'm famous for pushing 'mandatory worker owned co-ops' as an alternative, but thats just one alternative, there are dozens more. there are many economic systems aside from capitalism which have been tried and tested, sometimes for decades. and of course capitalism itself is not a monolith either as there are variations in the formula which make it less, or more, repellant. but people will argue with you when you push these alternatives. and after a short time it just becomes evident they have no idea what youre talking about. they're literally just defending something they dont fully understand against something they dont understand at all. why? just to be bootlickers? just from feat of change? it makes no sense to me   


On top of that they argue we cannot afford a UBI, or cant afford to feed and house everyone. Really? in a country with 17 million empty homes and only 550,000 homeless people you think its impossible to house everyone? hunger; it would cost 25 billion to end hunger in the USA. in such a rich nation thats a very small number. saying these things are impossible is utter ignorance. it's people not having the facts, not caring to research them, and defending something they dont understand   


Once you have the facts the absurdity and needless suffering of the situation becomes all the more apparent. and i'm just so sick of people who dont know what theyre talking about defending it so mindlessly.

2994,I'm anti-work and it's a problem.,"I'll keep it short:

I hate being commanded by someone. Especially if it is not necessary. For example hierarchies such as a boss.

The next problem is simply forced social interactions such as customer service.

Now to my personal problems. I don't like doing physically demanding work. But all that 'unskilled' labor is only left around here. Or work in the social section such as careworker. No, sorry, I just can't do that kind of work especially with shitty wage.

Another problem is the time. 40 hours... seriously? Not even 30 hours. I want 0 hours. But maybe I can do 10, 15 hours? There's not even jobs around here with 20 hours. And the wages would make it impossible to even 'live' from your work especially if you need to use the public transportation.

What do I even want money for? Basically nothing. I just want to have a somewhat modern computer so I can play normal games and guranteed healthy food. That's all I want yet I need to work 40 hours or even more technically to have that guranteed especially with shitty temp work 'unskilled' labour.

And the most ironic thing is that I already knew this sort of when I was 14. Now I'm more or less half a decade older and I dislike work even more. 

What would be my next step? Doing 3 years some apprenticeship where I'm paid even more shitty, doing it for 8 hours a day and feeling dread because I'm wasting my life by slaving away and then I'm locked into some kind of job I don't even want. Like I scrolled through all jobs, I want none of them. Maybe there's a few where I'm like: Hm, maybe 10 hours a week?

2996,Job application work culture stinks,"I submitted my CV for review but what got on my nerves wasn't the critique, which is fine, but the mentality behind employers. Here are a few examples:

""From the way the CV is worded, you come across as a ""doer,"" as opposed to an ""achiever."" Too many of your job descriptions are task-based and not results-based. This means that they tell you what you did, instead of what you achieved. This is a normal mistake for non-professional CV writers. To be effective and create excitement a great CV helps the hiring executive envisage you delivering similar achievements at his or her company. ""

I guess this sort of reeks of false advertising, or selling yourself. I don't like this culture, I ignore ads and sales pitches routinely and I find go-getters insufferable for their narcissism. I don't understand the appeal of Gary Vaynerchuk at all. 

Here's some more 

"" When I read your CV, I did not find the kind of compelling language that would bring your work to life. Instead, I saw passive words and non-action verbs.

Phrases like “Preparing” and “Providing” are overused, monotonous, and add little value to your CV. Strong action verbs, used with compelling language to outline exemplary achievements, are essential parts of a well-constructed CV.

Now, let's put it all together. Here's a real life example taken from a former client's CV. By changing the language, we helped to improve the perception of the candidate.

    Passive language / Doing: “Negotiated contracts with vendors”
    Action language / Achieving: “Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs 30% by negotiating pricing and fees, while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services.”""

One thing I've noticed across the board, not just in CV writing, is the fetishisation of active sentences. I never knew that passive language now extends to specific words rather than grammar. But from the above example ""slashed"" sounds like some Patrick Bateman style serial killer wordage.  If you've read 1984, corporate approved language does remind me a little of newspeak. Again I don't profess to say my CV is perfect, I just hate the mentality behind hiring culture, it reeks of egotism, falsity and an undercurrent of violence. And yet they make it seem like it's normal and something to strive towards. Yeah, I guess and I'd ask...how's your society doing these days?

3000,I want to quit my job.,"I am 27 and I have been working in a security company for the last 3 1/2 years. The only reason why I got this job was because I currently live with my dad still and my dads roommate was a supervisor for the company. I hate working this job because they ask me to do a lot of overtime sometimes 10 to 12 hour shifts and some of it is standing outside in 115 degree weather. I get asked to do a lot of OT but I am afraid to decline since my supervisor was once my roommate(he moved out earlier 2020) he would know that I just would rather goof off and play video games. Not only that but my dad has a strong pro work ethic and says that I should take as much OT as I should even though I personally hate it. He also says I should quit a job right when I have another one lined up.

I have been thinking about wanting to do a remote job for a while now ever since the pandemic hit and everyone was told to work from home. I would like to switch jobs but I got a couple of vacations one in late August and early September that I want to go on. But I hear that companies don't like it when you go on a vacation right when you start a new job. I personally think that working from home would be great for me. I know that some people say that they hate remote work. But most of the complaints that I see against remote work are that people have kids they want to get away from or they live close to the office. I am alone most of the time and don't have kids so it should be great for me. Plus, I get to sleep in 8 hours fully, no commute 40 minutes by bike or 1hr 30 minutes both ways by bus, I get to wear the clothes I want, I get to take gaming breaks, make dinner, and watch TV shows and movies in the background. So with all that, should I quit my job and how would I find a remote job?",False,oi8ybz,Advi0001,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oi8ybz/i_want_to_quit_my_job/,7,1

3027,Is it reasonable for me to quit?," started a new position in retail 3 weeks ago. Last week, someone came in and I got confused and mistakenly cost the store $89 (this company makes billions) because the person took their money back and I was too caught up in making sure I got them the right product to notice it because I wanted them to be satisfied with my service. When they found out, they told me he was a professional thief. I know it was careless of me and ultimately my fault. I researched how to have better habits and I swore I would not let that happen again. They decided to put me on a 1 month ""probation (they did not say this word exactly but it's basically that. They will count the money after each of my shift (I am the only person who will be at the registers) to make sure everything is still there. If any amount of money is still missing, I will be fired. I took full responsibility for what happened, but I feel like I am being treated like a thief. I am being treated as if I am the one who stole $89 from the store. This is not to say that when they go count the money they can't take something. Since it happened, I have been very cautious and am sure j didn't make the same mistake. Despite their smiles, their actions make me look like a thief. When it comes to teaching someone better habits, we are given a course for an hour or so, not monitoring them. Anyhow, I do not think I can thrive at a workplace that thinks I am stealing from them. I am considering giving a 2 week notice and leaving. I don't know if i should say this is why or keep it at personal reasons. I really do not need this job right now, I did it because extra money never hurts, and I don't plan on doing retail in the future or asking for any references from them for future jobs. I don't know if future jobs might call this store and ask about me and what they'll say but I will not put it down as a reference. Anyhow, what do yall think?

So if wageslavery is inescapable for me, and I have 8 hours a day + commute/prep time robbed from me, then it would be great if I could at least steal some of those hours back.

It would be great if I could just read books, manga, browse reddit etc... at work. Even greater if you could put on headphones and watch youtube videos and listen to podcasts and such, but headphones at work in my country is highly unlikely to happen. Also unless you had your own office, it would be harder to hear your surroundings so as to alt+tab before people see you slacking off.

Companies don't really reward hard work anyway. It'll just end up with you having to do more work, with maybe a meaningless promotion and a 5% raise tossed your way after a few years.

Ohh right it just dawned on me that most office jobs nowadays are cubicles or open spaces. Damn, there goes my dream of slacking off I guess.

3042,"On the job hunt, warehouse/moving chain baited me into an interview","On mobile, obligatory mobile format apology 

So I've been searching for a job for a bit now, I've been applying to firehouses here and there. Ideally I'd like to work as a firefighter. Though they work about 50 hours a week, the work is noble, the firemen are well compensated, and you do receive a Kelly day every month so I believe it's an ideal career for me. The chances of landing an interview are slim since there's so much competition, but it's the job I want so I'm gonna continue to apply myself.

My gripe is with labor businesses consistently trying to buy workers off for slave wages. I need to maintain a job until I can work as a fireman so I've also been applying to other companies too. One such place specializes in the movement of junk (via hunks that are in college - idk if I can say the name of the company). 

They don't always advertise their wages online and I managed to land an interview with them. I knew they were desperate for workers because I got the interview within the hour. I figure I'd go and see what they have to offer since they're very local.

3051,Warehouse work is completely poisoning my soul. Any other options with decent pay?,"So, i'm a 20 year old and live in California completely by myself, with absolutely no handouts. My parents live abroad in a third world country (it's a really long story). The one that has to help is ME. Over here on the other side, things ain't easy either. Expenses after rent, gas, grocery, etc etc are roughly $1450 a month. This is the absolute bare minimum for simply surviving and continue to exist. Most months, i break even due to urgent expenses.

I live in a constant sense of catastrophic impending sense of doom and urgency. I have a very no-bs, pragmatic mind. After wage slaving a year of my life (19-20y) working retail, i came to the conclusion that my life and youth would flash away before my very eyes if i didn't take IMMEDIATE action to succeed. I understood that in this fucked up world, it's either being the slave or being the slave master. I chose the latter. 

As such, over the past year i have learned a lot about the stock market, investing, and e-commerce. I'm really good at this stuff. I'm confident i can achieve financial freedom in my life. But in order to make money, you need money first.

So i had to sell my soul to the devil, and ended up getting a warehouse job as a contractor for $16/hr compared to my previous 13.5/hr retail job.

HOWEVER... the best way i can describe how i feel on a day to day basis working in a warehouse is like being constantly exposed to radiation as my soul slowly sips away from my body. The chaotic logistics of a low tier company with no ones as higher ups, the ridiculous amount of heat while wearing a mask, the lack of sunlight presence, nothing but sweaty tatted ex-felons dudes around and complete lack of opposite sex presence is completely, utterly KILLING me inside.

My mental health is going to wreck, and i'm going insane, mentally and physically. I'm dreading having to go into that warehouse tomorrow and waste another week of my youth away. I tried looking into other jobs such as lab work, investment advisor, etc etc but all need degrees. Fucking hell! Working in a lab setting with AC while wearing a comfy coat looks like absolute HEAVEN to me now.

I need a solid, ""stable"" backup job to fuel my business ventures, and i cannot see myself staying in this job for another month. Is there really NO other way? Where in the fuck do you guys get these comfy, AC office jobs that you can watch netflix series while on shift from? What is the exact set of words that i need to search for on indeed to score one of these?",False,oik2ym,Snowwzzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oik2ym/warehouse_work_is_completely_poisoning_my_soul/,29,1

3076,Overwork = piss-poor leisure = work-worship,"Bertrand Russell and/or Alan Watts talk about the vicious cycle of leisure getting a bad rap because we're not very good at it.  Here's how it goes:

We emphasize work above all else in our life for 5-6 days of the week (if we’re lucky), bottling up all other aspects of our personality in the process.

We enter our free time demoralized and fried, with little creative energy left.  We try to cram in all our fun to make up for the week of suffering, so our leisure tends to consist of blacking out, watching trash TV, maybe taking a frenzied cookie-cutter vacation, etc.  In short, stuff that puts more pressure on our body and isn’t particularly healthy.

Work-humpers then point to those activities to smear leisure and exalt work as the only state that’s “constructive.”

Rinse and repeat.

At the risk of brining toxic “work-ethic” thinking into leisure, sometimes I think we owe it to ourselves and to society to step up our leisure game. Longer breaks, intentionally used, giving the non-work parts of our soul proper time to play. Not just numbing ourselves into a stupor to escape the pain.

3079,Do you want to know how to make money on Instagram in 2021? One way for full time income &amp; to leave Job.,"Instagram is one of the most comprehensive graphical content (Mainly photos) sharing platforms on the internet. And this is one of the biggest social networking sites, which is getting 1 billion active users every month. 

Instagram has grown immensely in the past few years, and now it is one of the powerful marketing tools. 

One billion is a very large number, and it encourages influencers and business owners to use this platform to their advantage. So if you want to make money on Instagram, then stick with this article, and you’ll know how you can make money on Instagram in 2020.

In this social network, followers matter a lot. If you have a larger following, then your earning potential from this platform will be higher.

There are some great ways of making money on Instagram. In this article, you'll see 6 ways to make money on Instagram.

I mean by larger following is that having a broad and engaging fan base, not fake followers who aren’t engaging with your content. I didn’t mean you cannot make money on Instagram with small size following. Of course, you can, as long as your followers are engaging. But if you have a huge following, it will maximize your reach, audience, and earnings. 

So do focus on building a big and engaging audience on Instagram. Let’s start the main content of this article, which is how to make money on Instagram in 2021, or you can say ways to make money on Instagram in 2021. 


1. Make Money On Instagram From Sponsored Posts:-
Brands reach out to influencers for shoutouts and pay them for sharing a piece of content, which called sponsored posts.
An influencer is a person who has a fan base on any certain social platform and shares content regularly about a niche.

As an influencer, you have to understand your audience before accepting sponsored posts. What they are expecting from you and what you can promote in front of them that they like. Also, you have to keep in mind your niche.

Let say you are in the fashion niche, and you are promoting a marketing tool that doesn’t make any sense, Right?

So only collaborate with brands that have products relevant to your niche. In the fashion niche, you can accept sponsored posts of clothes, shoes, accessories, etc.

Sponsored Posts
If you’re curious about how to get sponsored posts, then the answer is quite simple. If you have an engaging audience and you are sharing content on a regular basis, no matter how big your following is, you’ll contacted by brands.

Here are a few tips regarding sponsored posts –

Make sure you disclose your sponsored posts by adding #sponsored in the description of your sponsored posts. This will help you to maintain a healthy relationship between you and your audience.
Make it easy for brands to let them know that you are accepting sponsored posts and how they can contact you. You can add this short snippet to the bio of your Instagram profile.

2. Make Money On Instagram By Becoming A Brand Ambassador:-

A brand ambassador who agreed to a contract with a company to fulfill the company’s vision by promoting their products. Brands are looking for big influencers who can continuously spread knowledge about the brand’s products.
In this way both sides get profit. As a brand ambassador, you’ll earn a full-time income from this agreement. And brands will get sales for their products by influencer marketing.

If you are wondering how much influencer marketing is powerful for brands and companies. Here is a thing, many people make their buying decision for a new product when they see that product is using by someone else. When they find that person having a good result from the product, they’ll make up their mind for buying that product.
So that’s the reason brands are investing so much money on influencer marketing.

3. Make Money On Instagram With Affiliate Marketing:-
Do you want to make money on Instagram by just promoting other people’s products?
You might not get sponsored posts until you don’t have a decent following. So what can you do in this situation? Where you have a small fan base, and still want to monetize it. 

Here comes affiliate marketing.

Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest ways you can monetize your Instagram followers. Affiliate marketing is a process of recommending other people’s products, and when a sale made through your unique link, you’ll get a commission of that sale.

You can join some affiliate networks that relevant to your niche and start promoting products on your Instagram profile. Here are some big affiliate networks: Share A Sale, Etsy, CJ Affiliates, Rakuten, ClickBank, Amazon Associates, eBay Partners. 

4. Make Money On Instagram By Selling Digital Products:-
It’s another great way to make money on Instagram with a small following.
The fun fact about having a digital product is that you don’t need to create the product again and again. And when a sale goes made, you’ll get the whole profit of that.

If you know about your audience, what their requirements, and what their problems, then you can create and sell a digital product that solves their problems. Digital products like an Online course, E-Book, Guide, and more. Create it and start promoting it on your profile.

5. Make Money On Instagram By Dropshipping Or Selling Products From Your eCommerce Store:-
If you have an eCommerce store or you are doing dropshipping, you can use Instagram as your traffic source for your online store. You can showcase your products in your Instagram feed and stories.
Let your audience know about product discounts, new arrivals, exclusive sales, and other important updates from your store. In this way, you can attract your audience, and this will also help you to spread awareness about your products and store.

Do add your eCommerce store’s link in the bio section of your Instagram profile, and insert a call to action in your posts and stories to check out your store. So if your followers interested in that product, they can visit your store.

6. Make Money On Instagram By Selling Your Merchandise:-
Merchandise tends very well when you have a decent amount of following on Instagram. If you have some sort of following that would be interested in helping you by purchasing your merchandise, then it would be an excellent way to earn money on Instagram. 
For creating your merchandise, you can use sites like  Teespring. site will help to create a merchandise store for you. Just design your products, set prices for those products, and leave the rest of the work to them. They will handle all the further activities from printing to delivering the products.

Tips That Would Help You To Grow On Instagram:-
Here are a few things you should keep in mind as an Instagram influencer and when you’re using this platform for earning money. Do focus on the quality of your content. Instagram is all about images, so investing in a good camera is the only suggestion I will give you for enhancing the quality of your posts.

The next thing you should focus on is that posting consistently. Posting regularly quality content is the key to grow faster on Instagram. Capturing a couple of photos a day doesn’t take a lot of time. So take those photos, edit it if required, then post on the platform.

After that engaging with your audience is the way to build a strong and trustworthy relationship with your followers. You can engage with your followers in the comment section of your posts. You can host a poll or ask a question to your follower on your Instagram stories.

It’s also quite important to engage with your influencer community. Build a relationship with other influencers in your niche. In this way, you can help each other by sharing shoutouts and growing together.

What Next?
Now it is your turn to take steps and choose appropriate ways to make money on Instagram. I know there are also other ways to earn money on Instagram, which I didn’t mention in this article. So if you know or using those ways for making money on Instagram, then let me in the comment section.

The only reason I'm not walking out rn is because I need the cash to travel to college. I'm just tired of stress headaches, fear, 8 hour days with angry people, and constantly smelling like fries.

3091,Monday dread...,"I just started this new job a month ago. The work itself isn't bad and my bosses are okay. I make just under $20/hr working 4 10 hour shifts (5am-3:30pm) which isn't bad either and I know a lot of people are struggling to find good jobs right now so I try not to complain to much. But the people I work with, the work place politics and the two face backstabbing is almost too much for me to handle. Being a contractor as well puts me in an awkward position where the job doesn't have mandatory OT but I'm just expected to come in on my days off anyways.

I have also been told that if I don't offer up my free time ""they don't need me"". We also just had this entire past week off for the 4th which was awesome but now I'm a few hours from my shift and I'm dreading having to deal with these people. I'm an introvert and it's hard for me to trust people. I served in the Army and had any labor jobs prior to this, in those environments it's just different, if people don't like you you know, they will even tell you and at the end of the day you understand that and go on with your life. In those jobs we talk shit in a joking manner about eachother and no one gets butt hurt but week 1 at this new job I made a joke and a lady wanted me gone.... so now I'm silent, I speak to no one but help anyone in need to the best of my ability.

Am I doing something wrong? What and how do I even change something about myself. I feel I can't trust a soul and it's insanely lonely. I have the wife of my dreams and we love eachother like crazy and while I wait for her to get her job that she got a bachelor's in so I can finish my degree and move on I struggle daily ro find the point in all of this nonsense that we as humans put ourselves through. Why can't I just be happy, why can't I just fish and enjoy the outdoors without working 40+ hours a week at a job where it feels no one likes me and it forces me to feel like I should just be on my own island. I don't care if they don't like me, it's just a job at the end of the day, but I am a human with feelings.

I dont know, does anyone else feel like this? I just had to type this out to get it off my chest.",False,oijk6i,AmazingMojo2567,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oijk6i/monday_dread/,9,1

I'm due my appraisal soon so I'm going to bring this up and tell them that I'm gonna find another job unless they either pay me for my time or get all the way off my about leaving on time.

Anyway, to pass the time and make it clear to everyone that I am not a willing participant in this capitalist nightmare, I've taken to decorating my workspace with the most de-motivational decorations that I can.

3121,A good read,"Farmer Bones

His is a hell of a paragraph.

americans are, of course, the most thoroughly and passively indoctrinated people on
earth. They know next to nothing as a rule about their own history, or the histories of
other nations, or the histories of the various social movements that have risen and fallen
in the past, and they certainly know little or nothing of the complexities and
contradictions comprise within words like “socialism” and “capitalism.” Chiefly, what
they have been trained not to know or even suspect is that, in many ways, they enjoy far
fewer freedom, and suffer under a more intrusion centralized state, than do the citizens of
countries with more vigorous social-democratic institutions. His is at once the most
comic and most tragic aspect of the excitable alarm that talk of social democracy or
democratic socialism can elicit on these shores. In enormous number of Americans have
been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than, say, Germans or Panes
precisely because they possess far fewer freedom in the concrete. They are far more
vulnerable to medical and financial crisis, far more likely to receive inadequate health
coverage, far more prone to irreparable insolence, far more protected against
predator creditors, far more subject to income inequality, and so forth, while effectively
paying more in tax (when one figures in federal, state, local, and sales taxes, and then
compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country, as almost nowhere else:

their taxes do not cover). One might think that a people who once repelled against the
mightier empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would
not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services. But we accept what we
have become used to, I suppose. Even so, one has to ask, what state apparatus in the

free” world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens
while providing no substantial civic benefits in return, solely in order to enrich a
practically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the

immensely wealthy?

3128,I got covid and am quitting my job after 5 yrs and some drama,"TLDR: I worked for a company delt with alot of drama, including jail. And came back like an idiot

Ive been back at this company for almost 5 yrs and ive worked with them off and on since 2007. I left the first time b.c coworkers treated each other like shit and when i addressed it nothing was done and i was treated even worse. They tranfered me to another store, i stayed there a while and another store became short handed so i agreed to another tranfer. Was layed of a few months later. I came back and went to on-call status and started driving the service trucks. One night I was on call and went out to do some work. About 20 miles away someone was stopped with what they thought was our(stolen) merchandise and they were apprehended at about 2am. B.c i was on call and out that night i was asked to come to the police station(and i did like an idiot, i was young and dumb) in to be questioned which i didnt have the answers they were looking for but they stuck me with a bunch of charges and stayed in jail for 4 days until my parents friend bailed me out. It took 3 yrs alot of fighting the system (plus $8k) but all charges were dismissed and exponged. All the while noone from the company would speak to me except 1 person and he no longer works with them. Not long after that one of the head techs quit and i was asked if i could come back to the store i originally started, which was more money and more responsibility and being on call again. I asked for gps and dash cams in the truck which i got so i felt better. Come to this day and there is a different manager who doesnt give a crap about the employees. Being on call all the time, working holidays, weekends, nights (after working all day), etc has burned me out and i am completely done. The reason for this post is for reassurance thats all. Ive delt with alot from the company, put in alot of time and recently got COVID was told to stay home and would be paid....... i wasnt and wont be. I took this day off and spent it with my kids.

I had two Zoom interviews, one with the line manager, then one with the line manager and the MD of the company. Everything looked promising. 

The third interview, they asked me to go to their office. I drove the five hours there. I met them both, met the whole team, talked about how their process works, how they distribute their products and liaise with the clients. I talked about the international travel, and talked about how I would be living near my family and partner… Everything felt great. So, feeling confident, I drove the five hours back home. 

Received an email when I get home, to say that they will contact me the following day, regarding the position. Excellent, a quick turn around!

We get by, always have, but everything just keeps going up in price. We make OK money, like $80k a year together, but shit is expensive. 50% of our income goes to just renting. We are currently trying to buy but that's probably not happening.

We make too much for any government assistance which both of the kids mentioned are eligible for. Like what am I supposed to do? Work 80 hours a week cus my kid is disabled and so I cant afford child care? Or should we both quit our jobs, get rental assistance and food stamps and just mooch? 

I do what I have to because I have kids, I chose to have them. I however did not choose for them to have disabilities and the costs, both financially and emotionally that come along with that are ridiculous and unbearable.

3143,I plan to quit my first ‘adult’ job,"I’m a recent 2020 grad, 23 y/o, and I’ve been at my first full-time job outside college for 9 months now. It pays well, has decent vacation/benefits, and my coworkers are perfectly fine, but it’s not a great fit for me because the environment feels too uptight, I’m not passionate about the organization (public school), and more often than not I’m doing tasks I don’t enjoy.

This week I decided it’s time to quit next month so I can re-focus my energy on finding a job that I care about. I’ve tried applying to other places, but find I just don’t have the mental capacity to do so after I’ve put in my 8-10 hours each day. 

I’m coming to this subreddit because I’m really scared to actually quit. Part of my job is acting as an admin assistant, so I’m essentially someone’s right-hand man. I know I don’t owe this job anything and they can’t tell me no, but thinking about the meeting where I announce my departure gives me a lot of anxiety because I’m a very conflict-avoidant person

I never did well in school, and I’ve been terrible at just about every job I’ve ever had. I burnout much much quicker than most. A huge problem with adhd is that I will only excel in things I’m extremely interested in. My brain blocks out uninteresting shit, making it hard to learn or invest myself. So, most jobs are fucking hard. I try. I try really hard. I’m always on time, eager to try and learn, but my disability means that I’m always a little behind. I don’t understand “basic” or “common sense” things and people treat me like I’m stupid and bully me over it. It’s hard for me to learn quickly and adapt to fast paced environments. It doesn’t bother me so much, being behind, but it sure as hell bothers everyone else. Work life is so bad for my mental health, I always end up breaking down and contemplating suicide because I can’t work like everyone else. I’m beyond exhausted. And it never feels like enough. Nobody will accommodate me. Nobody will even hire me if I’m honest on resumes. I didn’t ask to be born like this. 

And not to mention being medicated. My doctor literally tells me to only take my meds when I’m working. What, so I can be less of an inconvenience for everyone else? So I can be tolerable and more “normal” for *you*? My life does not revolve around how productive I can be for my shitty job. And I do not take medication so I can be a good office drone. 

But I HAVE to work because without medication I don’t take care of myself. I hurt myself and try to commit suicide. And my medication is expensive. I can’t afford it otherwise. Life feels like a cycle of torturing myself so I can get meds that just barely help me, in the end making me worse off, I’m so tired of being called lazy for not wanting to participate in this fucked system that leaves me behind simply for being born ND.",False,oh9ikf,Throwawayuser626,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oh9ikf/the_system_wasnt_designed_with_neurodivergents_in/,34,1
3147,"Got my dream job 2 years ago. Almost got raped by a manager, left immediately, I've been freelance since. TY for this sub","I've been lurking in this sub for awhile. I'm kinda glad that you all have the sentiments I have regarding my views with work and how truly manipulative some companies can be. I never told this story before to any of my friends because I feel like its a burden. Judging from this sub, you seem to understand these type of things; abuse. It makes me feel validated for the beliefs I attained after the incident when I got my first real job in my field cause I never went back to ""orthodox"" jobs because I have trauma still..and have been trying to decide if I should go back to office work/corporate in general. I love to work whenever I feel like it and now I'm faced by the pressure of my parents decisions about my freelance life. Well here's my tragic story.

Three years ago, I always knew that I'd work immediately after college since our school culture loved competing with who's gonna have work first and the biggest company to work for. It's toxic, I know but I jumped on the train and did my resume, I was an active student, I even made it really pretty using Photoshop and bought a nice suit for interviews.

I am already a freelance worker to begin with. I loved creative work but my folks didn't like that and wanted me to be in an office instead, cause they are Asian and they want me to be a ""professional"". So, I got a job in this really big food company in my country. My psrents were floored because its a pretty big deal. They'd love to please people and tell about it, I didn't care I judt wanted to earn money to have good equipment for my creative work. 

So, to start, I got my own huge office, huge benefits and a really great ladder of opportunities. Yet..That's what I thought.

I was hired to be a trainer and offered a salary that was pretty competitive to where I lived. I was given a big office. It all seemed too good to be true, then my hunches were right. I suddenly had to move to another office. Yet, I had to..well.. clean it cause ""they never hired a janitor yet"". I had to buy my own supplies too which was weird. They never told me this in the interview which is already a big red flag cause I didn't work for that responsibility , what am I supposed to do. I have no problems cleaning but they won't pay me for it. My manager told me ""just see this as tapping knowledge in office architecture"". Rude but okay, this is my dream job so sure. It looks like I could do it on top of the multitude of stuff I had to do? 

Second red flag is.. I was presented with contract for signing and my monthly compensation dropped noticeably. I said ""I thought I was offered *X* amount. Then they were like ""we know you're willing work here right? Its just that you'll get so much here such as travel benefits, its gonna be on your travel card, the extra cash is in it.. it'll be the same."" I was so confused, extra work, less pay? Maybe.. Then I never got the card. Also I had to train people so I had to stay in hotels and staff housing. I was even told I would travel from island to island, which is not what I signed up for, because it would be a town to town thing..I was like, well they have accomodation so alright, naybe free food too. It was all like clouded at this point. 

I was travelling long hours and started to contemplate that this job was a mistake. I had to carry office stuff using my car (I am not a company car why am I doing this, this is not in the contract). I got stuff too heavy for a woman like me. Yet the ""cool"" free uniform they gave, the free stuff, the pride they shown me..it seemed so rewarding but it felt like a scam. Then I met the people who I will train. The crew. I was part of the fastfood department for training so I got an immersion, oretty normal. Then I cried right after.

Let me tell you, these people, they don't have bathrooms, they don't have lunch breaks, they work 12 hours for 10 dollars a DAY! Sometimes even 7 dollars. Sometimes none. Someone reported to me they worked 36 hours straight because they couldn't get someone to cover their shift. Some were pregnant. Some made mistakes and begged me to not tell the upper management. I couldn't stomach it. Morale is zero to none. Alot of questionable stuff is happening. Then reality hit when I met the folks training me; they were all leaving me.

They told me they couldn't stomach the job anymore, they are leaving me so I could do all the work by myself. They said thy only worked for ""x"" amount of time because ""its a famous company"". My manager at the time was a terrible witch that, transferred her whole office in a different part of the building in the company cause of her attitude and maltreatment. Her assistant,told me nasty shit and told me ""leave before you can, this isn't the place for you"" and I didn't even ask. It was scary and heartbreaking because I thought so differently of this company.

The three nights before I decided to leave, I stayed in the staffhouse. I said I was gonna stay in a hotel but they dropped me there because of scheduling reasons, yeah right. It was gender separated. So it's only natural to see only women in my quarters. This was not the case. As I was about to sleep, three drunken men forcefully entered my room, they wanted me to drink with them. I was in bed with my pajamas. I remember earlier that day, the lady in my room introduced me to one of them and he was a manager. I was so scared I pretended to talk to someone on the phone using a voice recording of my friend as they wanna yank me. I cried after they left when they heard the sound of my phone. I never experienced being harrased like that by three large men. It was so scary I thought I was gonna die. Then I asked my roomate, the lady,l if men were allowed in our rooms and they said that was a big violation. I was really done for cause if a newbie like me reported something like that in a foreign place, id be ridiculed or power tripped. I couldn't handle the stress anymore because it wasn't what I was expecting nor applied for to have JFC. I left after a month. I got nothing, not a single cent from them. Which I'm glad for, don't want any dirty money.

My mom then was diagnosed with a strange gout that left her legs slightly paralyzed. I used that as an excuse to leave work indefinitely. My girlfriend picked me up and told my mom she will work and she wants me to stay freelance instead because of this story. So guys, working for greedy bastards is terrible no matter how reputable they seem. It's not worth the trauma.

Guaranteed 3 weeks vacation per year, no questions asked and no ""emergency"" calls. I can even work from home whenever I want (though because of the nature of my job, can't be away from my computer for long).

Oh, and the kicker to everything I mentioned, I'm only 22. I've only worked at this job for a year, my parents got me this job due to connections, and yes, I was born with essentially a silver spoon. I got into a good college, have no student loan debt, and ""own"" a car I have never paid a cent for. I've been given so much privilege my whole life, and if I was the kind of fucker my parents want me to be, I could easily be the next Musk or move up in the company without lifting a finger. I have that kind of mobility.

So why am I leaving? The answer is simple: I feel guilty every day I participate in this system, and reached my breaking point. I'm so sick of me getting all these opportunities while the underbelly of this world gets spat on and told to fucking rot. Everyone should have the chances I get, and yet it all goes to me because I came out of the womb of a robber baron. I've become a husk of a person, alone and wholly separated from the working class of this earth. I've lost all my drive for hobbies. I've drifted away from my friends I had in public school. All that's left is my weight gain, and a messy apartment with my bed and the piles of shit I bought for hobbies I never had.

Some of my coworkers are constantly sick. Some of them are hopelessly trying to lose weight. Some of them are jerking off the boss while they get paid $15 less than I do. They placate to me, buy obscenely expensive vehicles to be like me, enjoy their graphics card that they got for 5 times the MSRP, and then continue slaving away while ashes literally rain from above. It didn't take long for me to look around at work and ask ""this is it? This is the pinnacle of civilization?""

I'm breaking the wheel, fuck this privilege I was given. If I can be in a job that 70% of the US would envy to have and STILL be miserable, then why in the world would I keep climbing expecting to find happiness at the top? My parents will be pissed, but to tell the truth, I stopped caring about them a long time ago. They made my life hell in many ways I don't want to discuss here.

Thankfully, I've been radicalizing myself. I'm checking my privilege, making sure I don't spend in excess like so many of my parents' friends love to, and trying to find a simpler life without having to rely on ""rental properties"" or some other form of passive exploitation. All of the stories on this sub certainly helped as well. I know there's still so much conditioning I have to undo, and I know I haven't even scratched the surface of understanding the issues at hand, but I really want to make sure I don't perpetuate the crimes of my family. I could become some William Minerva type, but to be honest all I see is more power struggles and more toil arising from that. I'm just tired.

What am I going to do next? Hell if I know. Drawing cute girls falling in love with each other sounds nice, as well as maybe finding some friends at the university nearby. Or maybe I'll go live out of a tent, get as sustainable of living as I can (*The Man Who Quit Money* comes to mind), and bribe police officers to leave me alone. My idea is so long as I don't continue the Cuntwagon Dynasty, I think I'll be okay.

I chose my career at 18 like a lot of people with is absolutely bullshit. The idea that you have to know what you want to do for the rest of your life as a high schooler is ridiculous. I went to community college for 3 years, one Gen Ed requirements year and 2 in my chosen profession, radiography. (X-ray technologist.) During my second year of college I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and wasn’t nearly as skilled at managing it then as I am now. During my last semester, I had an absolute mental breakdown and went to an outpatient hospitalization program for 2 weeks, missing that time in the program. I knew it wasn’t a good sign that just the schooling was so overwhelming for me, but I finished my degree anyway because I was so close to the end. 

After graduating, I moved 8 hours away to another state and got my first job at a Goliath of a hospital. Think mid-eastern coast (USA), world authority on medicine, the “S” is not silent hospital. I should’ve worked at a smaller hospital or urgent care center for my first job. It was hell there most days. Healthcare is brutal. We were understaffed, some days I didn’t get a break. I was treated poorly by coworkers, one in particular “got back at me” for a mistake I didn’t know I was making at the time (I was brand new, hello) by making it so I didn’t get lunch that day. I had a second mental breakdown and did another 2 weeks in an outpatient hospitalization program. The entire time I was hounded by my manager about when I was going to come back. Dude, I’m trying not to kill myself rn. When I made the decision not to go back to work I asked my manager to have a meeting and said I didn’t want to discuss it over the phone, I’d rather talk in person. But he pushed me until I told him I was quitting. He didn’t even have the decency to let me quit in the way that I felt was most dignified when I felt like I had so little at the time. I owed the hospital something like $6,000 (I think, it may have been higher) for “training fees” because I’d only been there for 6 months. Turns out I wasn’t a good investment. 

I went on to a nannying job. I’ve always been good with children. I began with the family I’m with now right after quitting my career and I’ve been with them for 2 years, along with working other jobs here and there, but now they’re the only family I work with. They have two children, 2M and 6moG. I’ve been with them since 2M was 6 months old. I just absolutely adore him. The baby is so difficult and juggling both of them leaves me wanting to pull my hair out most days. I miss the days when it was just he and I. 

I’m being underpaid along with not receiving all the benefits I could be as a nanny. I asked for a raise earlier this week and it’ll be discussed today. I have hard limits for how far I’m willing to compromise, and still won’t be getting all the benefits I could as to not rock the boat too much. I don’t know what I’ll do if they don’t meet my expectations. If I wasn’t as attached to 2M as I am, I’d quit for another job offer I’ve had which would halve my commute time, include higher pay than I’ve asked for here along with having benefits. 

I just feel lost. I’m miserable most days. I’m tired and don’t have much energy at the end of the day for my husband who I love tremendously. I just want to rest. I want to enjoy life. I don’t want to feel trapped by a paycheck anymore. I don’t want to work. I hate life today.

&gt;  
&gt;Sort out attitudes and ambitions, teach the bright willing kids in the top set and less able in the lower sets, teach them different things, give them different career expectations.

Replace ""bright willing kids"" with stupid sell-your-soul sycophants and less able with the truly street smart and you're onto reality.

3186,Phone interview cancelled because I wouldn't download microsoft teams.,"I do a lot of tech and electrical work. Gig work mostly. There's a bunch of agencies that have me on file and call me like three times a year for random projects. They're all incredibly unreliable and I barely trust them to not undercut me at the best of times. Anyone familiar with the agency called Outsource-who I went through on this project-may or may not have similar feelings about them as I do.

I was just on a project for 2 days for this company where the guys running the project knew seemingly nothing. They didn't even know how to change a coax fitting. I did not give a shit. I just did their monkey work and went home.

Today, like 30 minutes ago, outsource called me to tell me that that company wanted to get in touch with me for a call in 30 minutes about hiring me on as a service tech for this region for when they needed it. Sporadically part time work, if that. Not super appealing. Whatever, I think.

""Sure. Why not. Give them my number.""

They proceed to send me a link to download microsoft teams to join in on a teams call.

""I don't have teams. Are they going to call my phone number?""

Told to see if it works. I'm not downloading microsoft teams for an interview they called me about 30 minutes before hand while I'm outside doing other shit. 

""Nope. Doesn't seem to be working. Have them call my phone number.""

Waiting to see if they care to make the effort of placing one normal ass phone call for a candidate THEY sought out.

Radio silence for 30 minutes. Get a call at the appointed time from my agency. They try for 10 minutes to link a call together and fail. Was told they'll ""get back to me.""

*Sure thing*. I'll be waiting by the phone for you until then.

I expect to never hear back about it again, and frankly, don't care. Outsource calls me like 3 times a year, and almost never responds when I need something. Every time they contact me they're disorganized and it's often some new handler because their turn over is probably really high.

The amount of times I've thought about just telling them to not call me anymore for how sporadic and useless they are easily outnumbers the amount of jobs they brought to me.

3198,"How to get your way, when things initially don't...","After a long period of uncertainty the large corporation I work for sent out an email about a month ago stating that hybrid work from home was going to be the norm for about 80% of employees. A day or two in the office but if your direct boss (manager) allows it you can work from home full time. Yea me. I'm a good employee and I am sure I will be allowed the option when it comes to that point.

There is one specific job that traditionally has been done in building for network security purposes but has been proven to be possible from home using the workflows and new security options in place. The only reason it still is being done in person is for legacy reasons only. Everyone knows this.

That brings us to today. Our supervisor (one level below manager) sends out an email saying to our team of 5 that he is instituting a rotation. Every employee will have to come in person for two weeks and then switch with the next person. For a job that can be done at home. Almost in direct contravention of the corporate email.

Internal emails from all the guys blow up. F* this, hell no, etc, etc. What you'd expect.

I wasn't having it. I told everyone not to respond to the email about the rotation at all. I'm not even the most senior guy, but if everyone was just going to complain amongst themselves and not act I had to pick up the flag.

I asked them and clients if they liked the work we were currently doing and have done throughout the pandemic and the if the shifts we were working affected anything negatively. I also asked the guys that if we could get the software we needed to make the work happen from home ourselves if they'd be down to buy it themselves.

Got all my ducks in a row, price quotes for the software, and got client and employee input and called the head boss directly. I laid it out straight. Look, no one wants to come in. We don't need to and here how much its NOT going to cost you to make it happen. Oh, by the way, all our clients are really impressed with what is currently in place and would prefer it stay that way.

You know what answer I got?

- 'Everyone feels this way, you've talked to them?'
- 'Yes, except for blah, blah as he's on vacation.' 
- 'Okay, tell you what. I'll purchase the plugins for everyone in the group. I can probably get the budget. If it's working for everyone we can skip any rotation for now. I can't guarantee it can stay that way forever but no need to rock the boat if it's going to cause this amount of trouble.'

It went about as well as I could have ever imagined. It's almost like COLLECTIVE ACTION actually works....

Crazy, right?

Sorry for the length but ultimately today taught me such a valuable life lesson. If you let your employer step all over you they will step over you all the time. Also, never assume that every arm of a big business knows what the other arm is doing. My manager had no idea our supervisor even did that. So now instead of getting forced to do something no one wanted the person getting in shit is the useless middle manager. By the way, it was made plainly obvious he was the one who wants to go back into work to both make his existence matter (micromanaging perfectly capable professionals) and to get out of the house that he's always complaining about (stereotypical Boomer 'my wife sucks' schtick).

Fight the power. Your bosses generally don't give a damn about you. The problem for employers now is that workers now know the value of their labor and the importance of work / life balance. The genie is not going back in the bottle. Now isn't the time for complacency. If you see some BS, call it out. Everyone has options.

This is not ECT, this is using shocks as behavior modification. The JRC is the only place in the world to use this device. Individuals have already died there, and if someone doesn’t stop this then there will be more. 

I’m so disgusted by this. We really live in a society where people feel so burdened by their disabled child that they’re willing to go as far as torturing them. The root of this problem of course, is that people are working so much that they don’t have time to care for their disabled children. So, they give them up to places like the JRC to become someone else’s problem. The JRC exploits this and profits off of these torture devices. 

We cannot just let this continue. Maybe there isn’t much we can do individually about the entire system, but we need to start breaking it down piece by piece. If you’d like to help out,

3210,You are just a broken machine,"Once you are out, you are done. You are a broken machine. Almost everyone is on the treadmill, on a spectrum that stretches beyond our ability to see in both directions. You think are ""getting ahead"" or ""falling behind."" You think you are going to ""win"" or ""lose"" at something. All these posts of people who think they are breaking out, or hurting them, you are accomplishing nothing. You are a broken machine. You want more money? You want less work? All the language you use, every thought you have shows how trapped you are in their prison. And there is no way out. You will never escape. Death is the only way out. You lost the game the second you were born. There is no plan for you. There is no place for you on the Ark. There never was. No matter how hard you ""work"" for them. No matter how much easier you make their lives. I don't even think ""they"" know how ""they"" are. They will be just as surprised when they are plucked from their ski chalet, or penthouse in New York, or Underground bunker in London, or office in Zurich, to find out that they are one of the ""chosen"". If anyone is.

It is all going to fall apart. We will have no choice but to kill billions of people to save a few hundred thousand. Who knows when or how it will happen. There is no other plan. Nothing. There is no UFO coming to pluck you from a country road. There is nothing. We will blunder along. It will all get worse and worse. There is no escape. None. We are not teetering on the precipice of destruction. We went over the edge before any of us were born. No money, or jewels, or gold, or food, or skin color, or test result, or good intention, or religious affiliation is going to save you. Whether it takes a thousand years or happens next week, someone is going to release the virus, or the prion, the chemical agent, the army of drones, the swarm of nanobots, or all of these things. But you will likely be dead before then.

We are all just broken machines that were born in freefall to a dying society, in a dying world, that has no place or use for us. It's not here for us. It's not here for anyone.

I work in the creative industry (writing + some design stuff) and I usually freelance but I kinda need a more steady income.

3218,I realized something about my job that disgusts me,"I work as a dishwasher at this seafood place near me and it’s usually pretty chaotic as multiple tasks need to be done simultaneously and because it’s a restaurant, things need to be done really really fast. The managers make no real attempt at explicitly allowing a break even for for lunch. We’re allowed to, it just is never really made clear when we can, since there are a ton of tasks constantly. Though this may be obvious for many of you, I realized today as I’m literally sitting now and eating my lunch that even on my BREAK I instinctively operate at the rapid pace capitalism demands. It’s literally the one time during my 9 hour shift that I get to sit with my thoughts and breathe, yet I find myself wolfing down my meal because I know there’s gonna be a massive fucking pile of dishes and prep cook containers to clean.

3219,A generous timed 30 minute lunch,"Hello everyone, hope you are well!

As you may guess, I've always had an axe to grind regarding many everyday realities that come with working full time regardless of the job (though the flavor of bullshit may vary). This nonsense can vary from the sheer amount of time work takes, to ridiculous policies and ""unwritten rules"" , you name it.

Today I wanted to do a small comedic rant regarding an aspect of my current job that drives me up the wall: timed 30 minute lunches.

Granted, I currently have a simple low paying retail job..and all the crappy stereotypes that come with it..but regardless:

Who the fuck decided that 30 minutes of lunch for a grown ass adult was a great idea?!

Last I checked, we aren't primary school children eating two raisins while sipping on apple juice from a fucking box.

High school students (at least where I lived) even had a longer lunch than that..at 75 minutes.

You are telling me that after continuously being on my feet all day , dealing with the general public, and lifting heavy objects while multitasking, we (as adults) have less time to eat a decent meal than a fucking high school student? What a joke!

Not only are the meals limited due to the time restraint ( that is to say not a proper full meal, but rather a sandwich or reheated leftovers); but oftentimes, we don't even get to use the whole 30 minutes.

By the time you leave your station to pick up your lunch from storage area (cafeteria), wait for the microwave, move from one area to the other, use the washroom/wash hands..a solid 10 minutes has probably gone by. If you are getting your food outside..it's even worse (for obvious reasons).

On top of this, we are expected to punch in the fucking machine at the beginning and end of our lunch breaks too..so that the management can record us better. Oh, and going to the machine (which is naturally far from the cafeteria) takes time too.

In my humble opinion, regardless of your job, an hour and 10 minutes should be standard across the board (with the ten minutes used to move around, wash up etc) with an hour being the absolute strict minimum.

Fuck these inhuman morons!

I have a new boss who’s an asshole too who’s already indirectly threatened me in the last month since he’s been at the job.

I know he’s trying to scare me into not taking any more sick days but I’m at the point where I honestly don’t care what he thinks anymore. 

On top of that I do have underlying conditions (which I have not told him abt, because he’s an asshole, and it’s very sensitive to me) which requires me to take sick days now and again so me being absent will happen sooner or later, so I’m really tempted to just stay home for the next 5 days and not have to see his face.

 I explained in the meeting how I couldn't work cos I was vomiting, and I was following NHS guidelines by not coming in within a 48 hour period of me vomiting. They still gave me a written warning for sickness. I said how unacceptable I found a punishment for being sick is because I work with food, and they said ""it is company policy."" I also explained how I had worked through pain and tried hard to complete my shift but I physically couldn't, and they repeated the same shit.

Big companies that want to put adds / buildings / other things they can profit of in the games world will need to pay in these assets meaning they will have to buy them from the users themselves. 

Imagine you play this game and buy a plot of land that u then develop with buildings from resources that u mine and earn. Then u rent out that land and later sell it or have digital advertising billboards that u rent out to companies you earn passive income from that and invest that in a mining plot and mining equipment. Then u earn these assets from mining and sell that to corporations again. Corporations will buy them because they make profit from it aswell because there will always be people buying stuff like skins, weapons and other items. 

In the beginning it will be hard for people to understand it and people will say it is a cashgrab but eventually people will see it as a way to earn money without the need of manual labor which imo is unethical for the amount they get payed.

3264,"This might be it, I think today is the day I walk out forever","I'm done. I am planning on quitting today. I have had enough.

I want to preface this with a little bit of info, I've known since my first year that the CEO and a ton of higher management are scientologists; I've essentially just minded my own and paid no attention to any of that, but in regards to how me and other employees were treated I definitely feel like that factors into this (seeing as how the CEO has a legal history of firing people for not wanting to convert).

I've worked for the same office for almost four years now. I do data entry for an at home sleep study office and at first I was pretty content with my job, it was my first office job and the people I directly worked with were wonderful; I liked my manager, coworkers were great, and even people on the phone were tolerable. There were always minor things that happened, but nothing too bad.

Well, 2020 happened. That was a shit show. 

First off, no one took covid seriously, I heard higher ups joking about it comparing it to HIV/AIDS in that it will eventually not be an issue (lol). They only sent people to work from home once the local government required them to, and even then as soon as they could we were demanded to come back in office; no one wore masks, no safety precautions, nothing. Multiple people became sick, they never informed anyone that covid cases happened in the office.

After that, they outsourced about 40 percent of the office, I had to watch coworkers leave in tears. They expected us to keep the same workload with half of the office gone and with incompetent outsourced employees.

After all of this, I was very drained and stressed but still working due to y'know, capitalism, but they decided to mess with the one thing you should never touch: paychecks

The pay period was change from biweekly to whatever [this](http://imgur.com/a/ADsLrhZ) mess is. Honestly a lot of us working here think it's due to the CEO not wanting to have to pay employees potentially three times in a month. Three times now checks have bounced. And as of today they handed out checks on today, our payday, and said we cannot cash it till next Tuesday. 

I feel like this is all some sick twisted joke. I have reported this place multiple times to the department of labor and nothing has ever happened; so I am doing what is best for me and plan on walking out today, I have nothing lined up but thankfully I have some savings and I'm thankfully in a good rent situation.

3267,"Cheer me up, please","Hi !

I'm going in front of my desk to work every day for months, and yet I don't work. I put myself in front of my computer, I boot it up, I open the software required for my work, I respond to a bunch of messages and emails. But when it comes to actual work, I do a pause before working, then I do another pause after that pause, then I go grab something to eat, then It's not worth to begin working before lunch. And I do that all day, and it has been months. I'm not even doing something enjoyable, nice or productive, I just distract myself on internet, because I'll work right after that, or so I convince myself. I'm just trying to find energy to begin working, but it takes me ages to find it. Sometimes, I find the energy to actually work, but it usually doesn't last more than one day.

A few months ago, I actually had a several days streak. But then, one day, I woke up, motivated to work, I open the company chat app, and some colleague is asking me to change stuff because it doesn't please his way of working. He doesn't present it this way, he's asking for improvements, but these improvements are really just style changes. I try to argue politely that he's wrong, it's only about style, and he can't force his style on my work, but he's not having it. My motivation evaporates. I could argue against him more, go to higher ups, but I just don't have the energy, and accept to make all the changes he asks for the sake of getting rid of the task. Even that was hard because he'd change his mind multiple times along the way and would make me changes stuff back and forth. At least, during that process, I very clearly, firmly and politely told him he's full of BS, and he'll never bother me anymore I think.

I'm amazed I didn't get fired yet. Frankly, if the boss calls me and tells me he fires me because I underperform, I'd just agree. No hard feeling, just the plain truth. But it doesn't happen. It has been almost two years, and I think a productive worker would need a single month to do what I did in that time.

I liked my previous job way more, I was a productive worker, but they were underpaying me. They BS they couldn't pay more, but I knew it was BS; invoices from some projects went over my desk, I knew they had tremendous sales... I applied elsewhere, got offers, they made a counter a bit lower than the best offer. The raise I initially asked was way below that counter offer. I doubled my gross salary by switching job. I wouldn't even have applied elsewhere if they didn't try to lowball me. I would have accepted the counter offer if the new job didn't seem so nice (industry and technology wise). Anyway, the previous company went under because of Covid, so there's no going back.

It's not like I hate my job. Well, I had some difficulty to adapt because my team were asocial people who would eat in front of their computers, always speak about work related stuff, and the tasks I had were poorly defined, among other things. I changed team a few times, and after about a year, things were better. Yet, my motivation never came back. Colleagues are friendly, tasks are well-defined and useful, I don't have to speak with clients, the pay is good, but I can't work.

I'm wondering, will it get better if I switch job ? Do I need like a year of holiday to reload ? I fear I'm just broken and that the job is not the problem (anymore). Well, it's not like I don't have a plan. I'm doing evening courses along my full-time job, I'll present my thesis next month. Being able to enjoy my evenings and weekends should really help me rest. Then I go freelance by next year, that way I can switch job way faster if I don't like it or take time off whenever I want; I obviously need to pay bills but worst case, working six months a year should be enough to survive. I'm really not sure if it'll work out, though.

I get it, you don’t want to be here, I’d rather you not be here or at the very least  be paid a fair amount. I’m all for it. But it is incredibly uncomfortable when you go into a place of business and someone is rude or obviously just wants to get you on your way. 

I try to be pretty easy going when I’m out shopping. I always check online before going to a store to make sure this location has the item I want. And if I can’t find what I’m looking for, I never really bother to ask an employee because I’m sure I can just find it elsewhere.

3296,"Hate my Job as a software developer, need to transition careers for the sake of my health","I currently work as a software developer and I hate my job. I absolutely cannot stand it anymore.  It's starting to get to a point where it's seriously affecting my physical health, not just my mental health. I have an anxiety disorder and I absolutely have to find a way to reduce my stress. I wake up every week day morning with a sense of dread. I'm having issues sleeping. I'm having digestive problems. I get deeply depressed on Sunday evenings. I am just miserable. 

I'm realizing I hate coding. Even if I only had to do it 40 hours a week or even 30 I'd still hate it.  The work is boring, difficult and tedious. I can't daydream while working bc I have to constantly be focused. My evenings and weekends are basically useless in terms of my personal life because I have to spend that time recovering from work. I'm always exhausted after a work day or work week. This makes it hard to look for new work because my current job takes up all my time and energy. 

The industry has zero respect for work life balance. Every single company I have worked for lied to my face about only having to work 40 hours a week. I regularly work 50 or sometimes up to 70+ hours in a week. If I take a day off they don't reduce the amount of work given to me so when I come back from a day off I have to play catch-up.

It's also a thankless job. I receive constant feedback/criticism on my work, but get no acknowledgment for the long hard hours of work I put in. I'm ok with constructive criticism, but they should acknowledge the good with the bad. I frequently have to have meetings super late at night to update systems when users are not online.  It's expected for developers to sacrifice their weekends and evenings on a regular basis. Everything and I mean everything is ""we need this yesterday"" and the constant rushing to do really complicated shit is really fucking with my head. 

I've had 5 jobs since 2015 including my current one. I keep getting fired or laid off bc I eventually reach burnout and my performance declines. I worked for 1 company twice though. Once as a consultant for a year and then for 2 years as a direct hire. I've been at my current position since mid January, and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I get let go. I feel like I'm running an endurance race and my body is about to give out. I just physically can't do this shit anymore. 

I'm feeling trapped. I have a lease I have to cover and other bills and many lower stress jobs just don't pay enough to cover my expenses. They also often don't have benefits. I have no clue how I can turn my resume into something that will land me a better job. 

I make 85k now and I know that amount makes me lucky, but I don't really save because I blow all my money on weed or alcohol and eating out bc I just can't cope and I don't have the energy to cook after working. I've been doing a bit better about saving since I started my new job, but I only have about 2 months worth of savings at best. I'd be happy making far less money as long as it still covered my bills and wasn't so damn stressful. 

I'm just not sure what to do, I don't have family I can rely on. I'm completely on my own. If I run out of money I'm fucked. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed. I have no clue how long I am going to be on this earth and I desperately want to find a way to not be absolutely miserable. I'd like to have a job where I could listen to podcasts or daydream while working, but idk if there is a decently paying job that fits that description. 

Any advice on what to do and how to healthily cope would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has made a career switch after only having experience in one field, I'd love to hear about how you did it. What I'm doing now just isn't sustainable and I need to find a way to make a change. 

TLDR:
I can't take it anymore. I feel trapped in a career that I absolutely hate. It's affecting my physical health. All my job experience is only in Software Development and I'm not sure how to transition to something else. I need something lower stress that still covers my bills, and has health insurance.",False,ogz9ib,Club411,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ogz9ib/hate_my_job_as_a_software_developer_need_to/,22,1

They sat me in the back corner cubical (surrounded by 3 empty cubicles) and I am the only person in my department except for my boss. Well, one other person works here but put her 2 weeks notice in about 2 weeks ago. So I got no training due to her carelessness and I have not another soul to talk to. I'm not kidding, I want to cry when the receptionist walks back to my desk once a week to just see how I am... it's sad. My boss works from home 3/4 days a week and regularly takes personal days. I just sit around waiting to get work from other people as I basically handle corporate communications. I can't send anything out if I do not get the documents. 

I feel a sense of panic now that the other girl is quitting because the entire department's workload will be on me, just one month after starting! I have been applying for jobs like crazy but find it hard to book interviews or when I ask to leave early, it's shut down. It will be so hard to find another job but this one is the worst job I've ever had! They lied and said I would work with tons of people my age but nobody is in my department. They also said I would have the opportunity to grow in this position but there is nobody above me but the director of my department.. I wouldn't get that job if I was here for yeaaars.

Today has been such a bad day too. All-day I got emails from my co-worker inquiring ""where's this"" ""where's that"" when I am waiting around for people to respond to my emails to get that work done. I literally cannot do my work unless they do their work... not my fault. And I am getting yelled at for it. When I mention I am overwhelmed they have 0 idea why and make me feel bad. It is a common theme that I feel dumb at this job. But I am not!  I just do not know how much more I can take of this and every day here feels like I am digging the hole deeper and deeper.

Thing they don't know is I'm now living in Mexico since it was one of the only countries in the world to be fully open during the pandemic before we got the vaccines, and you can stay up to 6 months, cross the border over to Belize or Guatemala (with an antigen test) and come right back into Mexico for another 6 months, I've met people living here who've done that for years.

I find the Mexican people lovely, the food is incredible, the culture fascinating. I have taken the opportunity to sign up for a gym here in CDMX and get fit, to learn Spanish (obviously), to learn new life skills not related to the world I was doing, I'm not just lazing around.

Yes it's illegal to get welfare while living abroad, but fck them, I've given more than enough in taxes to the system, they owe me this. Renewing your welfare in France is all done online and checks hardly ever happen especially now with so many more people filling for it with the pandemic.

I had a shared office with 1 other person (later alone because he left), shared another office with 3 other people and worked in an open plan office. The offices were okay regarding noise, I had a wall behind me, no people walking past me constantly. Work from home being my favorite of course, because I can get all my work done at my own pace in peace.

However, I hate the open plan office (or larger office rooms with 8+ people). It is just loud, someone is always talking, you have to have your headphones on all the time to be able to concentrate, no privacy, people being able to look at your screen constantly (this annoys when I do work, feels like someone is always watching me). They added some dividers in the open plan office (why not just add walls?), we got some fake cubicle walls that we could attack to our desks, we had silent rooms in case you need to focus on your work (like should this not always be the case?)

Anyway, so my question to people who have worked in cubicles and open plan offices. Is it better? You have at least some walls? I am assuming the noise levels are still bad and from what I heard people hat cubicles just as much. I am just interested.",False,ogr62z,TravisFlexThemPlease,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ogr62z/open_plan_office_or_cubicles/,9,1

3381,Involution - extra effort does NOT necessarily mean extra reward,"There's a mathematical concept called involution where applying a function to x and applying that function to that result, returns x. This is modern life.

 *f*(*f*(*x*)) = *x* 

In other words, no matter how many times you apply the function you always get the same result. If f = work hard and x is your starting state, you can see how it is a formula for modern life.

It's basically how the rat race is constructed. Hard work does NOT necessarily bring reward. It brings about more of your starting conditions. (It brings about more work typically)

3390,"Regarding October Strike... I don't want it to be forgotten. I want it to happen, and I want it to be big.","I really want October Strike to become a widespread thing. I doubt it will cause any immediate change, but it will definitely make them take notice. Is anyone planning on holding gatherings or speeches? Remember the fight for $15 at McDonalds (which is already outdated because of inflation), there were people presenting speeches for a crowd and talking about their issues? I think presenting speeches for crowds on the day of the strike would make it even more noticeable.

I've been thinking about it for a few days, and decided I'm going to type up some little index cards to spread awareness for it, and I'm going to try going to different grocery stores or fast food restaurants and, without trying to draw attention from the managers (who would instantly kick me out as soon as they realize I'm not feeding them money), hand it to some employees that are interested and then walk out. There are a few managers in the area I know personally who I'll give the cards to because they're laid back, but otherwise, I won't bother with the managers.

I figured index cards are the safest route, because if push comes to shove (manager notices), I can just walk away and act like I was confused about a product, and an index card is something the employee can quickly shove in their pocket. Would putting up posters on telephone poles be illegal? Because I've seen people do that to advertise garage sales.

I probably don't have to tell you this, but if you are planning on holding speeches for a crowd, just be as safe as possible.",False,ogutim,Fetrospec,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ogutim/regarding_october_strike_i_dont_want_it_to_be/,6,1
3391,Fire my whole team? Okay,"I’ll be quitting and taking them with me. 


Got a new manager a few months ago, he’s a real do-nothing. I’m over a very busy department in a big store. He essentially believes if you aren’t firing people constantly you aren’t doing your job. I care for and defend my team. They’re human beings who rely on this income and deserve better than to be scrutinized and belittled. 

I am also currently very pregnant and he’s clearly not been managing my performance as harshly as other department heads for fear of legal repercussions. But he has threatened to fire my peer over another department for performance issues which are just bullshit.


So, the friend is quitting, I’m going on leave and likely not to return, and unbeknownst to me until this week, my team has been planning to leave all at once if myself and that peer leave. Because they can’t imagine working directly under him while they find my replacement.

3412,"Got laid off yesterday. Story in body. If you think companies care about you, you are wrong.","First off, I don't care that I'm saying who they are. Superior Plus Propane, corporate office in Rochester, NY. Accounts receivable team. I'll even provide manager's names too.   


It started off as a decent temp job. It wasn't very busy, steady work, decent co-workers minus 3-4 absolutely miserable people. I didn't mind it. Then, about three months in, I realized they were paying my friend whom I referred to work on the team with me $2 more an hour. Despite us doing the same job, with the same experience. We are both 25-26 years old. So I took action.  


I called the rep at the agency where I was employed and asked for the same pay raise. Worker's rights, after all. I do not blame the guy for giving me three different reasons why he made more than me, I don't think there was good communication between the agency and my employer.   


He said everything from oh he negotiated it, to I don't know how much he gets paid, to this position pays $2 more an hour. All bullshit. I think he was trying to cover his ass because the employer is completely toxic. I don't blame him one bit, I think he was trying to scramble for reasons.  


Fast forward to a few weeks, ago, we told our other co-worker (yes, I know, be careful about befriending co-workers, but I have a keen eye for reading people so I knew she was safe with us.) about the pay issue and she goes wtf I want to be paid the same too! She was getting $17 an hour and doing WAYY more work than we were. I would be upset as well.  


Word got out that we were discussing pay and as of yesterday they laid off my friend making $19 an hour and myself, citing ""performance issues and discussing pay."" First off, it is NOT ILLEGAL to discuss pay on the job. I will be filing a wrongful termination complaint with the labor board in my state and filing a few other grievances against them. I think they let us go because we were adamant about fair treatment and management following through on things they said. Which, shocker, they did not.  


I never had any warnings about pay, performance, or any outstanding issues with management. This all threw me for a loop. I can't say I'm surprised, but this only cements my feelings about management at corporations. The day we got laid off (we didn't find out until after we got home) we had a team meeting and both our upper manager and direct supervisor were talking about ""changes to the team"" and ""restructuring moving forward"" all while never looking us in the eye.  


You do not matter to these people.   


I had a gut feeling after that regardless. I knew something would happen so I just played on my phone the rest of the day. I didn't expect to get laid off but at the very least I expected a notification about the position being gone.  


Whatever. I believe we were forced out for standing up for equal pay.   


We were not working from home anymore but yet my manager would work from home whenever she wanted. We were chastised for making mistakes yet her emails had horrible grammar and she would never get back to us about issues for at least 3 days. Yet, when we messed up in a minor sense, it would be immediate. Priorities, I guess. Asking questions about the job warrants a 3-day window, but making a small error with dates is a 2 minute response time type gig.  


The place is disgusting. You have to question nothing and be okay with doing mindless computer work and paperwork for 8 hours a day. As I said, it was okay to start, but my anxiety was getting worse and worse the more I was there because I couldn't use my brain. The last week or so I was in fight or flight mode, even after I got home. I had been doing so well with my anxiety too.  


If you looked at your phone or took breaks, the old boomer in the corner would shake his head as he walked by you. The man worked 6-4:30 a.m. and never left his desk. I can see why he was a miserable piece of shit.  


Overall, if you love double standards, unfulfilled or changed promises, and management that couldn't give less of a shit about you, then this is the place for you. 

OH, and to top it off, they promised us we would be paid for the holiday on July 5, yet when I submitted my time card, my manager said I only was entitled to work 16 hours this week, not 24.  


Mmmm, nope. Not gonna fly with me. So I re-submitted the same card that had 24 hours on it, and she approved it.  


Sleazy. Fucking disgusting. I don't play around. Companies do not care about you or your rights as a human being. If you speak out, you get shunned, and in my opinion (in this case), laid off.

I know the job, not much is expected of me, and I don’t have to work too much. When I came back I stressed that the job had to be part time as I’m still in college (and honestly don’t want to work away my last summer before I join the 9-5 life). My boss was fully aware that we are short staffed and that our weekend guy would be leaving but just seemed to ignore it like it’s no issue. Now that he’s about to leave my manager has decided to add the weekend guys shifts onto mine, effectively making me full time. When I told her no dice she told me to work it or find a new job. I’m graduating college in December and don’t really want to take on the hassle of learning a new job but my current job is just so sleezy and I really want a part time job that has as little interference with my school performance as possible.

3432,I quit 14 jobs before I turned 23,"I just stumbled upon this sub and I would love to tell you my story. Maybe you will find it inspirational. 
I grew up in Spokane, WA and did horrible in high school. Graduated with a D average. No interest in college. I bounced from shitty job to shitty job after high school. Mostly restaurants but also a costco. Between 95’ and 2000 I had 14 jobs and left every one of them on bad terms. Not because I was a bad worker but because they all treated me like shit and when they did I would quit, usually when the restaurant was busy. Oh did I fuck over some assholes. Costco was a special case. They had a policy that after 90 days you were considered a real employee and they gave you a 25 cent per hour raise. Yippie!  They let me go out of the blue on my 87th day. A week later, a manager called me and was like “where are you?” “Uhhh I was let go.” “Well I have you on the schedule and we need you, can you come work?” I did because I didn’t hate the job (yet). I returned, worked the day and was informed that because I was let go, my 90 days restarted. I was like, “Okay, thats how it is?”
So I slowed my work to a crawl, collected a few more checks and was fired. Just basically made it my mission to stress them out while I was there.

Anyways…. I was now in my early 20’s and all I knew was there was something out there better for me. I am artistic but didn’t know how to make a living off it or what my art even was.  I can draw well and I’m sarcastic. My mom kept telling me I needed to get a job and stick with it. I just said “But these jobs suck and they treat me like shit. So no thank you.” She worried about me. A lot. 

I ended up moving to Seattle with a friend who already had a place there and was going to let me live there free until I got on my feet. I quickly found a job as a cook in a restaurant and we were off to the races again. I actually liked this job. I chalked it up to Spokane being a low class place because the people in Seattle were just more fun to be around. Just more cool culture in the air. People were more interesting. That pleasantness lasted a year and the manager just turned on me. No idea why. He just decided to take his rage out on me for several weeks. I had asked for a few days off around the holidays and i was given that time off. One week leading up to it I was on the schedule for Christmas day. I reminded him, he denied it. He said you will be here on Christmas day. I looked at him and said, “my bad, I thought I had asked for that time off. See you then.” You should already have figured out those were the last words I spoke to him. 

Now I was fucked. I have rent to pay and no job. Mom and dad are far away and I refuse to go back to Spokane. I just sat at home for days brainstorming how can I get myself into a position where I am my own boss with no college degree. It hit me. I had done a brief stint helping a buddy in spokane do some interior house painting. He gave me $60 for 3 hours of work because I did such a good job. (Artist!) I got on craigslist and cold called painters in Seattle asking if they needed any help. My 3rd call I found myself talking to a rather hilarious Australian guy who was like “you sound cool mate, meet up and I’ll train you.” I fucking loved it. We just hung out in empty houses chatting, joking and getting the jobs done. He paid me decently and it was heaven (as far as work goes.) Eventually he was sending me out on my own jobs. Around this time I discovered stand-up comedy and really took to it. Now I was finally set. I was going to be a comedian by night  and a painter by day. I would eventually stop painting when I could make a living off comedy. That was the new plan. Best times of my life! Met some other comedians who wanted to move to New York City and really try to forge a career in show business. We moved and I had no fear even though I had never been to the east coast and neither had anyone in my family. My painting skills took me far… I was number 3 on yelp for all of manhattan. I did cash jobs daily that paid between $300 and $1000 per day. I was very good, tidy and fast. I answered my phone on the first ring. My customers loved me. 

During my 6 years in NYC I made a shit ton of money (had fun spending it all too!) and transitioned out of stand-up into filmmaking and thats what got me out of painting. 

Cut to today I live in Los Angeles and am married to a comedian / writer who now brings in at least 150K a year and my best friend who I met in Seattle and moved to NYC with is a very successful actor and comedian. He’s so successful we live in his amazing back house and make a good living directing stand-up specials and we even sold a show to comedy central a few years ago so we shot 8 episodes. If you are wondering, that gig landed me $120,000 that year. 

I don’t know why I had this rebellious nature from the start. Maybe I have to thank my dad who worked a shitty hard job most of his life and was miserable. He set the example of how not to do it although he did retire at 45 so he could be a fishing guide and an artist in his own right. So he got there too. He never made great money but he was happy so you’d never know. 

People, its okay to have a shitty job.  Just use it for what it is… a stepping stone to the next shitty job until you figure out how to break free. Everyone has a talent. I didn’t hone in on mine until I was 30. When the job pisses you off, if you can, leave it and have no regrets. You can always find another shitty job but keep looking for that thing you know you can do that will get you away from it. I am proof you don’t need money, good grades or a college diploma to succeed. You just need to survive and bide your time until you figure it out.",False,ogsv93,JackfruitStunning793,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ogsv93/i_quit_14_jobs_before_i_turned_23/,63,1
3433,Opinion: The term ''NSFW'' is another aspect of how our society is needlessly obsessed with work,"So, I hope everyone here is in agreement that our entire society is needlessly consumed and obsessed with work. In Kindergarten, one of the very first questions we are asked is what we want to do when we grow up and we all say shit like ''police office'', ''fire-fighter'', ''doctor'' etc but most of us will be wage-slaves for retailers, restaurants and shipping companies with only a tiny minority of students actually being ''successful'' through unnecessary sacrifice, special connections and wealth.

Anyway, everyone here knows that the acronym *NSFW* usually applies to erotic or ''adult'' content and every subreddit has the option to add it to a post. It means **N**ot **S**uitable **F**or **W**ork and I'm not sure if anyone has ever really thought about the meaning of that.

To me, NSFW basically means, *''if it violates the working standards of your employer, you should not be looking at it''*. It dictates that the interests of your job/boss/employer supersede your own personal interests, even if they are private and it's probably the oldest and most socially accepted example of employers controlling the personal lives of their employees albeit inadvertently.

3448,I just started a new job 3 days ago and I’m already feeling like my boss is taking advantage. Is this red flags?,"Maybe I’m over thinking it. But I always go with my gut. I work part time as I take summer course. They offered me part time where I come in at 9am everyday. After my 2nd day, the girl who is training me went on vacation and won’t be back until THIS coming Thursday. She does EVERYTHING. I still know nothing obviously. But I was thrown in doing insurances and permits for people.

My boss is this Russian woman who I can barely understand. I come in at 9 like the last few days, and she then says “Can you come in at 8 tomorrow and next week since for me it is difficult, because I have to bring my son to summer day camp in the morning.” She gives me the key to open the building up. She then asks me if I want to be full time. I said no because I’m taking a summer course and 2 in the fall. 

I have ADHD and circadian rhythm. I’m still living at home. I’m so exhausted as it is working and school. I don’t pay rent… I don’t need full time atm. 

She also has a desk brought in for me, but it needed to be set up and 10 mins before I leave she asks if I can help put the screws in and guilt trips me into staying. THERE’s NO time clock to punch in /out.

So now I’m paranoid that that these next few days I’m not gonna be paid for the extra hour I’m working every day plus the extra 25 mins I stayed and the other 10 before that. I wrote it down, but these people are pretty incompetent and all over the place.

My boyfriend told me to just do it as it’s extra money and if my paycheck looks wrong then say something. I HATE having to do hoops like this. I have anxiety. My boss also wanted me to take some notary certificate thing online (just randomly came up to me and asked me to take it so I can sign stuff). 

I know none of this is BIG or should even bother me. But it does. I didn’t ask to be full time. Why am I opening this place up on my 4th day of work? Why did my trainer leave only a few days after I started for vacation? No time clock?????

3455,Thoughts on a four day weekend,"So as I would assume most of you know, this past weekend was American Independence Day, so Monday I had the day off. However I also had Friday off to attend a funeral. I spent friday with my family, Saturday I got to spend with some friends, Sunday I got to relax with my SO, and Monday I went for a bike ride. When I got back from my bike ride it hit me, this overwhelming sense of joy. This was the most time off I’ve had in years. In my line of work I often have to work (paid) overtime and extra days on the weekend, and while they make sure we don’t work two weekends in a row, it’s still never enough time to recharge. 

This is the first time in years I’ve felt like I had a moment to breathe. I was able to relax and get to do things I wanted without feeling like I had to cram it all into one or two short days. I have never been able to spend time with my parents, SO, friends and myself separately all in one weekend.

3463,"Here is my story for those interested. I think it brings some honest discussion coming from a young person in canada, with my own personal elements tied in","Originally a cross post from r/homeless



Im not sure how to put all this. Im in canada, near Vancouver, on Vancouver Island in a smaller city, 21 years old, male, and also LGBT in what I believe to be a socially conservative city. Quietly rascist and homophobic people, retirement town wealthy old people and some very rich and elitist too from all ages, NIMBYs and all, alot people here would shit on homeless so casually, it was always quite sad/eyebrow raising, and the poor low earning folks too. Some compassion fatigue and a whole lot of, ""it is what it is."" Definitely not as progressive as people put it out to be in my personal experience but I tried to see the light in other peoples eyes of this place like they did.

Lived here for 3 years worked low paying jobs lived with roommates, however I live with an emotionally abusive ex boyfriend right now, were together over a year, and the rental market here is bad, near 0% vacancy rate, and Im thinking of trying to go to Vancouver for help (and also what I think would be a better chance at life and opportunity in general?) but not so sure... but why stay in a place where the homeless are demonized and the poor looked down upon? (For not working hard enough? Or not applying oneself enough?) I did do all that here, worked especially shitty jobs to get by, the job market always seemed to have slim pickings and youre bound to customer service (almost half of job postings on job boards) if you dont have a car (for manual labor type work) or are not in school (people assume you cant be as intelligent as you can be for not having gone to school while so young here.)

 I feel almost like somebody/the canadian government? Whoever rich people stand behind them, wants there to be a hierarchy in place, where there must be ""losers"" in this world, and as if its the ""natural balance of all things"" but that seems like an unfair and brutal way to go about life not necessarily saying you think that way but showing it in action in what you say and do, and while too you may not necessarily suffer in the system the way others are, like how I feel where I am at. Im not trying to rant.

Yes, I have some trauma from my life before I came here and as well as some new trauma after the fact
 and even when I was working and providing for myself before I met my abusive ex I still struggled finding a place for myself here in this city and fitting in, trying to be my true open and honest self. Nobodys perfect but Im in a uni city and felt so much peer judgment from those my age for not going to school or having a car.

 I had a job, it was pretty low paying, but I quit it recently from all the stress and hopelessness over not being able to find a decent and affordable place to live here, and just not having been able to have a social life and a sense of belonging that I wanted.. I dont really know what to do. My family I have a very detached relationship with and for very good reasons. Neglectful parents with their own problems, mother lives out of province in rural AB (from Alberta but LGBT men I think have it much harder there, I did growing up). My father (step father) lives in smaller town north of my BC city but was always emotionally manipulative and condescending every chance he got, only ever seemed to care about money he got from me... same with my mom I helped her out alot but they never cared much about my life or what was going on.. 

People used to say I was a very intelligent boy/young man with alot of potential.. however I feel like there is a ceiling been built over me. I am a very creative type.. I would sing and play music and go to open mics in the past outside of work, and people liked what I did. Other creative hobbies like writing, it helped me find a place within myself even if I couldnt find it in my community wherever I lived.

This post is a sort of vent of sadness and hopelessness but also some proper advice.. I just wanted to live by my values that I think were good but I seemed to have been socially rejected in my city, people here always put off hanging out with me and overtime it does get to you when you live life paying bills and being part of the system/society much the same way everybody else is. And from my ex boyfriends part, he would constantly downplay my feelings, my uncertainties, and my wants and dreams in life, call me psycho and delusional so so much... but he did lie alot about alot too, he actually was paying for gay Onlyfans content the entire time we were together to give a sneak peek. 

With my family not being there for me emotionally, and my ex constantly making me question myself, how much I really did mean to him, and feeling like I wasnt enough... or I perhaps got too old for his liking, that is a whole other story of pain and so much learning in the way of trusting your gut when you should have.... that I now had a complete eventual breakdown of my selfconfidence to where I am today...

I am just a person trying to make it in this world but its been getting harder and harder every day lately and I know Ive done things people tell you not to do but where is the yellow highlight?

Is it me? Is it the canadian municipal, provincial, and federal government failing their people on their part? Do you think I actually sound like a crazy person?

Central banks are printing money into existence and giving it to rich corporations (banks) and buying assets causing asset inflation. That's why you cannot afford anything.

3467,"college grad. lost about the concept of a ""career"".","this will probably be a long post. i just want to get my thoughts out there and find anyone who feels the same way as me.

i recently graduated college with a digital media degree &amp; business minor and i honestly just felt pressured to go to school because of my family's culture. i didn't have any real career goals, i just got a degree and got the hell out so i won't be seen as a bum. i'm now stuck in a position where it feels fucking dreadful getting an office job. i can't see myself working in that type of position, and i know it'll be virtually impossible to get one anyway as i have no experience.

so what's the other option, retail? i hate the stigma with retail and how if you work retail as a college grad you're a failure, but i honestly feel i would prefer that to an office job sitting at a computer for the rest of my life worrying about ""did i send that email"", ""did i finish that report"" while lying awake at night. i feel like with corporate jobs, you're stressed all the time when you're not even at work, your entire life becomes the company you work for. of course retail is very stressful just like any other job but i feel like for someone like me who might have adhd, an office job is far too overwhelming and i want to cry just thinking about having to focus on one thing for hours at a time. 

i dont have a dream job. i dont have a career path. there is no position i see as ideal. i just want to see if any other college grads are in the same boat. my parents are expecting me to search for a ""real college job"" and it sounds awful and im learning now that i shouldnt have gone to college because i have no career interests that would require a degree.",False,ogq2ox,helioswan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ogq2ox/college_grad_lost_about_the_concept_of_a_career/,3,1

3477,The constant dread of being told you're not worth it.,"I just got out of a meeting with my manager. I work in IT (technical support), and suffer from massive anxiety and depression. My manager is aware of this, but I live in a country where mental health awareness isn't really present. A large part of my work is triggering for me and I feel constantly alienated from my own self only to be the person my job requires me to be. 

My 1-1s used to be pretty bad, until I started taking anxiety meds and therapy started helping a lot. My performance improved and yet my manager wouldn't acknowledge my contribution or even the improvement I've made. The last month or so has been extremely tough for me given that I've been going through a very bad breakup, consequently being excommunicated by friends and a bad home situation. However, this resulted in my manager taking me to task during my 1-1 and telling me that he'd have to let me go (one of my worst fears). I can't do without a job, and my anxiety doesn't really let me hunt for a new one.

3478,Medication in the US?,"So for those that have quit jobs or trying to quit, how do you handle medication costs? I have enough saved in my account to handle all of my expenses for over 6 months except meds that I need to function both physically and mentally. These are meds that I have to take daily and skipping any causes some big problems that would be disastrous for my health. I would say the main reason I haven’t left the job I currently loathe is because of the great health insurance.

I know about sites like goodrx for coupons but a few of my meds are barely any cheaper with the coupon than without (yes, one is Vyvanse and it’s $400/month without insurance and like $300-$350 with a goodrx coupon). It makes it hard to plan to quit with how expensive just one month of Vyvanse is. I’m going to continue working so I can save more and try to get enough to cover these costs but I also wanted to see if anyone else had any ideas or cost saving measures that work for US prescription drugs that are incredibly fucking expensive.

Expensive healthcare is the #1 reason why I feel trapped in my job and I haven’t found a way around it yet.

So here are my 5 lifetips of avoiding shitty bosses or a toxic work environment.


1.If an employer is willing to make you wait more than 5 minutes , they are actively testing if you have a spine or not . Spineless people get more chance of a hire . You are surely getting shitty bosses at the other side of that door. Walk out.

2. If you have kids and / or married they also like those , because kids usually means mortgage, and is good for keeping them in the slave system because people with a mortgage need to usually go from paycheck to paycheck. 

3. bosses who try to haggle down your hourly rate -&gt; immediately walk out the door. They will stop at nothing to pay you poorly or treat you like filth.

4. Watch for common mentality , if you see people that came from , let’s say the factory floor with a sour face or have no humour while you take a tour, it means it’s a “ watch your back “ , type of mentality.

5. Over exaggerating in safety measures . If you walk into a company and they baby you or have these extreme levels of security or safety, they will use that against you. Especially safety supervisors that will talk to you or berate you like you are mentally unstable. Also a control tactic to keep the weak of mind in check and to test for deviancy. RUN.

You might be committing time clock fraud!

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

ve.

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

© Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

© Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

© Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

\f 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100
are minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

The idea that some humans really think that other humans are not deserving of life turns me into something I don't want to be. I want humans to succeed so bad, and I really do feel like it's a bad sign that people fight so hard against simple ideas like ""everyone deserves life.""

If I could only say one thing to the people who fight these ideas, I'd say to please compare human consciousness up against the grain of everything else. Not to be morbid, but when you stand out in a mountain range, or float in the middle of the ocean, you realize really quickly how different humans are than everything around us. Nature is so stagnant, and then all the sudden you have human consciousness.

I'm sorry but even if you don't realize it, it's worth defending. It's amazing and incomparable, and this is coming from someone who has delved into hardcore pessimism / antinatalism for years. There's no escaping the uniqueness of consciousness when compared to the rest of nature, no matter how hard you try, and that's why it makes me so angry and sad to watch us fail each other.

Anyway, due to ""staffing issues"" and ""needs of the business"" the hours kept going up and up at no additional pay, despite my constant reminders about my health. So, last week (week 5) I am being left to manage queues of 15 people alone on a Friday and I think fuck this, this is not good for my health. 

After lunch, I hand my notice into my line manager who emails me a curt response then leaves the office for the weekend. ""X sorry to read you're leaving but understood. Your notice period is incorrect. You'll be working here until August 31st.""

3512,I'm tired of being ignored when I complain about something,"It will probably be just a rant. I don't know if you feel the same way I do when talking about problems about work.

In fact, I was extremely pro-work and capitalism before working hard and seeing the fruits of my hard work not giving any fruits. And this also happened with my coworkers that were working even harder than me and I was feeling too bad seeing us being exploited.

I'm from Brazil and I was making 2.5k (Brazilian currency). After finding out that this was the lowest salary in the company I asked for a raise and didn't get it. Started looking for a job and got an offer of 4k. When I put in my notice they offered me 3.5k, but I left anyway.

In the next job, the working conditions were worse, but I stayed for the experience with new technologies. In the next year the previous company that was paying me 2.5k gave me an offer of 4.7k. Comparing there two companies, this is far best because you work much less, so I accepted the offer. Now I'm happy as far as possible because I'm working half and earning more.

I was talking with a coworker that is a good worker too, but very shy and he was telling me that he is making 3.2k . The problem is, he is there for 6 years. I'm earning much more than him without any loyalty and being treated better. I'm pretty sure that if I didn't start looking for a new job, I would be still making 2.6k, 3k max nowadays.

My point is, they almost doubled my salary and they're still making good money. This means that they were exploiting me in my opinion, but people, in general, don't agree with this point of view. 

Another interesting fact the occurred when I was looking for a new job in the first time, was one guy that told me that my salary was good, he could not pay me more and I had to be patient (2.6k salary). The following month I got two offers, 4k each.

I'm just tired to be considered a bad person when talking about these things and not working as hard as I can 9h per day.

Human beings were not meant to live this way.,"Go to college, get a stable career, work 40+ hours per week for the rest of your life in some soul-sucking job just to have a bunch of numbers in your bank account.

I don’t know why I feel that I’m owed so much more from this existence. I’m not talented, I’m not driven, I have no work-ethic. Passion is a laughable concept. Yet these ambitious aspirations are the only ones that appeal. What an unfortunate amalgamation of desire and traits. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am highly privileged—I went to college, I have a stable career, I earn almost double the median income for my age group at 26. My job isn’t stressful nor is it difficult. However mind-numbing the day-to-day is, I should be able to tolerate it and enjoy the proceeds. *Should*. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is probably how most people feel, but somehow they are capable of getting over themselves and conforming. What I would give to find that level of acceptance.

Why do we just turn a blind eye to things like higher costs of living, but then complain about anyone desiring a minimum wage increase? No one should have to work three jobs to afford a crappy apartment plus bills, food, and fuel. This is such horseshit.

This is the only group that understands common sense. I have to change the subject with family anytime they try to shame me with crap like ""everyone works, stop complaining"".

3531,"Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren (1930) predicted a 15 hour work week, in a 100 years or so, with less economic growth than what we have already reached","Paper: [Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren (1930) by John Maynard Keynes](http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf)

Keynes made his famous 15 hour work week prediction in 1930. His calculations about the economic growth were even slightly pessimistic. We reached the size of economy needed for a 15 hour work week according to his calculations a long time ago. In a hundred years or so, he thought we would solve the ""economic problem"" that humans have to spend majority of their time working to meet basic needs and survive:

&gt;I draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not-if we look into the future-the permanent problem of the human race.

He was aware that the there would be dread and resistance at the idea. He even stops to ask if it is a good thing and will it be a benefit:

&gt;If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose.  
&gt;  
&gt;Will this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy.

He was hopeful that we would work hard to spread thin the amount of work that needed to be done, so that a 15 hour work week would satisfy our need to work for a great time:

&gt;But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter-to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible. Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!

He thought we would reconstruct our moral system based on wealth:

&gt;When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value.  
&gt;  
&gt;The love of money as a possession -as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life -will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semicriminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease. All kinds of social customs and economic practices, affecting the distribution of wealth and of economic rewards and penalties, which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful in promoting the accumulation of capital, we shall then be free, at last, to discard.

Perhaps right about the economic growth, he was certainly wrong about the development of the culture. He thought that lower classes would become more like the upper class at the time, which meant decreasing the amount of work and finding hobbies and other leisure time activities to enjoy. Little did he know, the upper class would instead start working more and the lower classes would struggle at buying housing to live in despite all the work they're doing.",False,ofemd7,Dysssfunctional,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ofemd7/economic_possibilities_for_our_grandchildren_1930/,0,1

New Zealand industry
ire grows as closed
borders worse
labour shortage

Raven Tendon 3 minute read
five@is

WELLINGTON, July 7 (Letters) - New Zealand's
closed borders have helped keep COVID-19 out
of the Pacific nation, but a critical shortage of
emigrant labour is now fulling protests among
business and workers struggling with a

standing crisis.

About 2,000 arteries stopped service and
turned off lights across on Tuesday and are
planning other stop work events as part of a
two-month campaign to draw the government's
attention to the severe shortage in skilled

labour.

The labour crutch comes after New Zealand
sealed its border in March last year in response
to the raging coronavirus anaemic. The
measures helped contain COVID-19 locally, and
Crime Minister Jacinda Order has vowed to
maintain an elimination strategy that's been

landed locally.
But although the COVID-free economy has

bounded back faster than expected, its
vaccination rate is much lower than developed
peers and immigration has hit historic lows,
leading to acute labour shortage in a country

that relief on low-skilled emigrant workers.

""Before COVID-19 hit and closed our borders
upwards of 25% of our workforce were
international work isa holders,"" Restaurant
Association on New Zealand, an industry body

organizing the protests, said in a statement.

""Losing them is enough to make a difference so
big that it can affect a business in catastrophe

ways,"" the association said.

Some restaurant in Auckland and other major
cities temporarily shut due to understanding or
just to give their burnt out staff a break, media

reports have said.

Adding to business frustration is the
government's rest on immigration announced
in May, which would further cut the number of
low-skilled emigrants when borders eventually
re-open, and look to attract more highly skilled

emigrants and rich investors.

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

e Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

© Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

e Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

e Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

e Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

Of 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100
minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

3544,Any Jobs That Pay At Least a Decent Living Left?,"Like holy shit. Does it even exist anymore? I'm starting to question whether it ever did. The whole system is fucked yet the more I try to find at least a glimmer of hope the more the void just stares back at me in apathy. In my twisted Stockholm's syndrome I feel grateful to now be making $20/hr and yet I still have to work an extra full time job to have at least a couple hundred bucks left after rent, utilities and going to a restaurant and ice cream place like once a week. Is there anything purely merit-based that can actually support a somewhat comfortable lifestyle without even just having to check your credit card statements because you want a fucking margarita?

Truck driver? Registered nurse? Auto mechanic? Software engineer? IT engineer which is basically a less intensive software engineer because they want you to code anyway? Those are the only positions I can even think of that don't take 7-8+ years of your life and multiple 5/6 figures of debt for masters / doctoral degree or some rediculously niche talent. It's not like Jim's cousin can lick ass into becoming a registered nurse because you actually have to have legal licensure to practice

And then even if you have any of these jobs you're just going to be working 70-80 hours a week anyway so after all's said and done you can't even enjoy your newfound financial comfort, and once you break the high 5 / low six figures down by the hour it comes out to like $24/hr anyway you just get a bunch of overtime which is supposed to be something we're actually expected, or rather cornered into wanting to have these days

3583,We finally reported our abusive employer to the labour department,"For context, this is my very first job, i've been working in this company for more than a year. My emoloyer has withheld our salaries for around 3 months now, and for the past years everyone would regularly get delayed and deducted salaries. Our employer is borderline abusive, the company's environment is so toxic because of his management. He'd yell at staff for every small mistake, he would make people work late without overtime pay, if anyone wants to leave the company, he'd give them a really hard time, and he would find absurd ways to deduct from employee salaries. We're on a limited contract, so there's gonna be a ""resignation fine"" if anyone decides to leave before their contract ends. Our situation now is we all want to leave but we dont have money to pay the fine (and nobody wants to pay that asshole). I think he got cocky because so far nothing bad has ever happened to him and he thinks he'll get away with anything.

We got fed up. A few guys and I filed an official complaint to the labour department. I was fucking nervous, I'm scared that nothing will happen or the employer would come after me, and I dread any future interactions I'm going to have with him after this complaint. It was quite reassuring that the labour department actually had our backs and assured us that they'll investigate and assist us in dealing with or leaving the company. Since not giving salaries is actually considered a breach of contract, we won't have to pay anything if we leave the company and we'll receive all our pending salaries. The labour department told us that whatever happens, the employees would have the upper hand in this case, and it's a good thing that we went with the proper steps of filing an official complaint.

Now I'm relieved but also filled with anxiety, I fucking dread the awkwardness of talking to the employer again ""professionally"" and discussing the matter with him (required by labour dept), but at least we finally made the big first step.

I kinda feel bad that the employer's now scrambling to convince us to stay, but it's not like he wasn't aware of the consequences of breaking labour laws and treating employees like shit, plus he had it coming, so fuck him.",False,ofggjm,mitate5039,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ofggjm/we_finally_reported_our_abusive_employer_to_the/,7,1

I never wanted to do the math. It's easy, but I never wanted to actually see the number.

I lose 5 hours of my life every day by working at the office.

That's roughly 54 days a year of my life just deleted for no reason. Imagine being on your death bed and thinking about how if your employers had an ounce of intelligence and compassion, for just 1 year, you'd have 54 more days to be with loved ones or enjoying life how you see fit.

54 fucking days.

3592,What is success in life? Short rant about a sleepless night thinking about what I should do with my life and what happiness means to me,"Yesterday my wife asked me if I wanted to do a masters degree. She is about to start hers and I am supporting her decision. It makes me proud seeing her rise to her potential. But thinking about doing a master myself made me feel inadequate, scared and sad.  I never really liked the thought of finding happiness in work. Work is just work. No amount of income, fancy job title or amount of responsibility would make me feel like it is worth wasting my life away in a corporate setting. In my opinion, everyone is replaceable nowadays. You can be the superstar of a company one day, and the dead horse the next. Corporations do not care about their employees, they care about key indicators, profit reports and pleasing the shareholders. You slave away everyday and get a fraction of your earnings in return as a salary. Yes, you get some kind of stability, insurance and other benefits. But in the end, you are still a replaceable part in a giant machine of generating more wealth. 

I work in social welfare and I see everyday how easily people get discarded by the employers if they can't ""provide and commit"" anymore. It makes me sad to think, that this is all there is to the human existence. We aren't born to work in closed rooms, in cubicles, in front of computer screens all day, while trying to not reveal too much about our personal life's to our coworkers and try to please the higher ups in hope to get a shred of recognition for selling our time. I always got asked as a kid what my ""dream job"" would be. I don't dream of working. I dream of having a happy life. Work is just a mean to survive in today's society and not be homeless. I am effectively forced to do labor to be able to provide a roof for me and my wife, put food on the table, pay my bills, pay my taxes and have a little something left for leisure activities, which I need to be able to tolerate work.

So getting back to the initial idea of the message: The question my wife asked scared the living hell out of me and I couldn't sleep that night. I was caught in a negative loop of thoughts. Spiraling downwards into my deepest fears, ripping up old wounds of feeling inadequate, being called a loser and feel like a failure.  I told her, that I don't want to do a master. Because if you have a master, you need to find a job on master-level. This comes with master-responsibilities, master-workhours, master-activities and so forth. Since I rather have a meaningful job (like social work) instead of a high paying career, I do not want to advance ""to the top"" where I need to make my job my life. I'd rather someday be a stay at home dad and look after the kids. My wife is different, she is driven by the need for success. Without a high paying job, a good career and social recognition of her achievements she feels inadequate. Quite the polar opposite of my personality. But she would be happy if she can work and I stay home. I see people whose only reason to get up in the morning is to run to the office and play the capitalist game are missing out on life.  So that send me into my thinking spiral. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you don't get a proper job, your wife will resent you and leave you someday 
2. If you become a stay at home dad, you will not be able to find a job ever again 
3. If you become a stay at home dad, people will judge you for it and make you feel small/inadequate 
4. Society demands that a man has a good career and brings money home or else he is worthless 
5. A man needs to constantly try to ""succeed"" in life e.g. playing the capitalist game and win 
6. If my wife leaves me after being a stay at home dad, I would be lost. I wouldn't be able to provide a proper life for my kids without a job 
7. If I lose my wife before we have kids, I have nothing left in my life. I lost too many people already. I barely got friends, I got no family left. I would end up as a hermit 
8. How could anyone love someone like me that has no real ambitions (e.g. winning the capitalist game) ? 
9. What if everyone in my youth was right and I am a no good deadbeat loser? 
10.  I am 34 years old, still playing video games. What is wrong with me? Shouldn't I ""hustle"" like everyone else? 
11. Why am I wasting my time enjoying life, when I could be more ""productive""? 
12. If I lose it all, I would lack the strength to make another comeback. My energy is gone, my will to withstand death, loss, loneliness and ""grinding my way back up"" is exhausted. 
13. I think I would call it ""a good run"" at that point and end my life while I am not a depressed broken piece of shit  

&amp;#x200B;

And that spiral went on and on and on. Thoughts getting darker and darker every minute until I was almost crying from existential dread. Life scares me sometimes. Losing both my parents and a lot of other relatives, losing long lasting relationships in an instant and seeing how replaceable I am in the work force taught me that the dream of ""retiring and finally live my life"" is an illusion and a luxury for only a few people.

All I want is to be able to be content and happy with my life. I want my wife, some kids, a nice apartment/house, being able to pay my bills and have enough leisure time to feel like I am living life, I want to grow old and see my family succeed and my kids thrive. I want to die an old man and know, I was there for my family and that my kids grew up with a lot of happy memories and not trauma or memories of ""dad being at work all the time"". My definition of happiness is choosing life over corporate slavery. Sadly this mental image is not accepted in today's society. You're only a ""proper man"" if you work hard, every day without complaining. Your only value is your social status at work and how much money our bring home. How fancy your car is, how big your house is, how many people need to listen to you at work and do your bidding, how much you prioritize being a good employee over being a human being.

3593,Company is completely against investing in their employees,"So I work at a franchise for one of the major pizza places in the US.

So what does the franchise do to retain drivers for more than a week? Increase our pay? Hahahaha...

3594,Boss let go 5 part-timers today and was boasting in the end of day meeting about how her store is the most profitable in the Country.,"So today I was told that I would not be kept on as a permanent Retail employee along with 4 others, the boss tells me it's because of restructuring the store / covid causing loss in sales (not even true, we still make budget pretty much every day)


At the end of the day the team has a meeting, our boss gives herself a big round of appaulse at making the daily budget (everyone claps for her but me)  like she didn't make anything we all did for her.

She then goes on to say her store is the most profitable in the Country and will be booming come end of the year and I'm thinking if that was true, wouldn't we still have a job? 

Also this bitch lied and said covid was affecting sale figures X__X


Here is the current staff situation: They have 5 department managers (yes 5 fucking managers for a retail store) 

and 5+ fulltimers (who are usually complaining about being burned out)

I just don't understand the logic here?

1. Why have 5 expensive arse managers who just do refunds and cashup when you could train normal staff?

2. Why so many full-timers? That's another big cost which could be divided among other staff members who only work half the week and swap around. 

3. Why bother hiring and training 5 part timers for a few months, give them a discount card and then a week after getting it they are axed entirely! Lol

In short, when the courts were looking to codify European land-theft from indigenous people into law, they cited “having worked to alter the land,”  (ex. cutting down trees) as what granted people rightful ownership over it.

Beside purposefully punishing indigenous people for their much less intrusive relationship with land, it’s interesting to see how deep the work-as-moral-high-ground argument runs in this country.

Though, of course, working on something is no longer acknowledged as giving someone ownership rights around here.  Quite the opposite:  making that argument will get you called socialist and anti-patriotic.

3601,"Just got laid off today for ""performance issues."" Story in body. This company is shady.","First off, I don't care that I'm saying who they are. Superior Plus Propane in Rochester, NY. Accounts receivable office.  


When I got hired on, it was a $17 per hour job. I noticed that a co-worker that they brought on after I started made $19 an hour doing the exact same role after he told me about his pay. I figured okay cool, they pay you more than me despite us doing the same job. I'll contact the agency and ask for the same pay raise.  


My rep said everything from ""well we don't really know how much they pay you,"" to, ""well this position does pay slightly more, sorry about that,"" to, ""well he did negotiate for a higher pay."" All from his mouth. Not his fault here, just saying what he said.  


My direct manager was horrible. She basically laid me and the other person making $19 an hour off because of ""performance issues"" and ""discussing pay"" which by the way is NOT illegal, and I will be filing a complaint against them through the labor board. I just don't think they liked that we weren't corporate sheep who did everything they told us and questioned nothing.  


They preach solidarity and taking breaks, yet they tell us to cut back on breaks. They chastise us for making mistakes even though we are human. Their motto is ""everything can always be done tomorrow"" yet we were criticized for speed.  


They tell us they like us and want to keep us on, then can us for restructuring. No warnings, nothing at all (hello unemployment). How do you go from liking us to canning us in a matter of a WEEK?  


I went in, did my work, took my breaks, and didn't over-exert myself. I stopped talking to my co-workers because frankly, it was exhausting, the small talk was a waste of time, and there were a few people there who were absolutely miserable. The place sucked the life out of me.  I didn't need to talk to them to do my job.  


I am going through a lot so taking breaks was very necessary for me.  


The point is, the company is shady, and part of us being let go was wanting fair wages and flexibility with working from home. There were others I'm sure, but needless to say, I'm glad I can take a deep breath and collect myself. I thought about leaving the place for a while, this is just a nice gift for me.  


So all in all, this company is shady, unprofessional, and the office environment is crushing. Know your worth. Do not be treated like a piece of shit or a piece of meat. This is most corporations now, sadly, but either way. There will always be a better fit. There ARE decent places to work. Sometimes you have to experience the bad to appreciate the good when it comes.  


I liked most of my co-workers, but there were about 3-4 that made it insufferable. Not all in my department, but in the same office area.  


Horrible company to work for that didn't even give annual raises based on inflation. Unreal. Zero growth potential there.

I literally worked my ass off as a waiter at a a stupid restaurant because it's the only job I could find fresh out of highschool. The only reason they fired me was because they didn't want to pay an 18 year old minimum wage. I always showed up on time, never complained about staying hours overtime basically every shift then walking home after 12 hour shifts because its 1am and theres no buses or trains running to my place at that time.

The very thought of going job hunting again terrifies me because I know its going to make me suicidal again. I cant deal with it anymore, I hate working for scraps that wont pay rent. I've been forced into homelessness multiple times during highschool because I'm trans and the most religious and transphobic/homophobic family you could possibly find.

3611,Thought Some of You Might Appreciate This,"I learned today that my employer (a major university) has a disaster preparedness plan for a zombie apocalypse. If I didn’t have official confirmation the plan is a joke I would have thought it was real lol:

•”We would anticipate that commuting would be feasible during outbreaks of zombiism such as those studied by Romero (1968),(1978), (1985), et al; while the Zombie Spectrum Disorder behaviors studied by Boyle (2002) would result in much greater difficulty with commuting and therefore greater need for work-from-home support. However, employees with small cars incapable of running over zombies may be forced to work from home in all types of outbreaks. 

•”Some employees may prefer weapons such as chain saws, baseball bats, and explosives that have been shown to be effective against zombies. Given the stress on staff to be anticipated during a zombie outbreak, employees should be given the flexibility to choose their own weaponry thereby diminishing anxiety. However, the University will need to consider the savings gained at economies of scale as well as enhanced ability to support a standard anti-zombie weapons “kit.” Employees should avoid dispatching infected employees in the absence of witnesses; this can cause problems with documentation.”

•It will also be necessary to teach situational work practices such as covering windows, barricading doors, and distinguishing between zombie moans and other moaning encountered in the workplace. Staff should be equipped with laptops and ensure IPCC software is installed, tested, and working for staff who may find commuting to work to be difficult.

You might be committing time clock fraud!

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

>
Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

‘+ Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

+ Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in

+ Take sure to secure personal items in locked before munching in.

‘Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

+ Once punched in, you are the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales for.

1F10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100

 

minutes a day. That's 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
patrol lost

I’ve been places where I had to sit through literal DAYS (sometimes off site with no travel reimbursement!) of it before I even got to start doing what I was hired for. Forced to sit in front of a computer watching unskippable company values videos, safety videos, nauseating videos about why it is so great to work for them, diversity videos, ALL WITH UNSKIPPABLE QUIZZES ABOUT EACH ONE. The worst onboarding scenarios are the ones where the company does it all in a room full of new hires and they parade a corporate department head shill in for each segment who all have the same script about how great the company is, and it repeats all day like Groundhogs Day! All to a room full of bored people who would rather be literally anywhere else. And you better hope your computer that you’re doing it all on doesn’t crash or freeze or you get to do it all over! All the while I’m thinking… you could be training me right now. Why waste so many resources and money on this shit?? It all serves the exact opposite purpose - Its a great way for them to show how tone deaf and out of touch they are. By the time it’s all over I absolutely resent the fucking company more than I thought I could. 

It makes me want to put my head through a wall and scream at them to just show me how to clock in, let me fill out my fucking W4 and A4, and let me get started. It should not be more complicated than that.

= Q INSIDER

Still, the sloth-blasting signs bounded
around my head as we visited Historic
Jamestown on the last day of our trip.
Historic Jamestown is a cultural heritage
site in Virginia, marking England's first
permanent colony in North America. The
colony was the product of a joint-stock
company's bid to exploit the area's resources
— and the jumping-off point of evils that
came to define the United States, like chattel
slavery and the genocide of Native

Americans.

Those who learned about this topic in
school may remember the narrative that the
settlement nearly failed because the
colonists were too idle to work. The reality is
likely far more complicated. The historian
Aren Ordahl Kupperman wrote that
colonists were likely suffering from salt
poisoning, malnutrition, and disease, along
with the psychological trauma of watching

their compatriots die.

American workers died during the
anaemic. American workers lost loved
ones during the anaemic. American
workers continue to contend with a deeply
flowed healthcare system, debt, an
tenable lack of childcare, and a death of

workplace protection.

3626,"My story as an ""Amazon"" delivery driver.","Well first of all, most of the things you've heard is true.  Let's start with what a DSP is for those who don't know. A DSP is a subcontractor that Amazon uses, there are no actual Amazon drivers. These DSPs are just people who had the money to beg Amazon for the right to be a scapegoat for them. All they do is recruit, everything is done through emails and 5 yes 5 different apps. (Oh and you can be a driver now by just downloading the Amazon flex app).


 These places have no say in anything it's all up to Amazon on everything. I came in and told the DSP agent (poor husband and wife in their 50's probably their retirement fund) this was a job I was taking as a way to be on my own all day and just do my job, (I have a very ""valuable"" skill set for today's market) I don't want OT, and she mentions these things called rescues. However those a voluntary, she understood what I was asking for and was ok with it..... Little did I know.


So I do 2days of ""driver training"" it's the same videos worded differently about 3 topics. How to use the app, how to load the vehicle (case that's fucking rocket surgery apparently) and how cool Amazon is and don't get caught on social media doing a crazy. Then some test about their acronyms that don't pertain to the job AT ALL. I played on my phone and muted the training, only clicking when it would let you.


A few things about being a driver. You have this phone that sticks to a magnet. This same phone tracks g forces and gps to see how you steer speed up or slow down. If you are speeding etc. Well it based on buggy ass Google maps integration. So posted speed limits are wrong sometimes, but the worst was a normal straight road and it kept screaming at me ""no stop detected"" meaning I ran a stop sign that is there according to the computer. Also if you touch your face. I adjusted my glasses ""distracted driving detected"" if the phone falls off the magnet (happens alot) it thinks you are playing on it while driving. If you yawn it get you too. You have a score and they fire you if it get too many of these things detected and a computer auto fires you. 


Day1 delivering. Goes good. Easiest job ever, I'm way ahead of schedule, I wasn't even trying. Get done and ""dispatch"" tells me I have to go help another guy... That's an hour away because he's behind schedule. So he parks for an hour for me and the ride along to get there, instead of continuing his fucking job. (Sorry I get it we all anti work, but as society is now, I'm not doing your fucking job. I get paid the same regardless)
So we go take 3 hours of his work for him. Get back home all late and shit.


Day2 solo delivery. Best job ever, NGL. For 18 an hour and I'm all by myself doing my easy ass job. I had untill 7pm to get my load delivered. I finished about 230pm. Call dispatch say I'm done.... No apparently I'm not. I gotta go drive 40mins to intercept another guy and take like 60packages of his.... Dispatch gives him my personal phone number to call me about his location. I never said I would do this rescue. They are supposed to be voluntary.  So he gives me where his 3rd next stop is. Well I'm 40mins away. I get a route to intercept him, as I get closer I see this is heading into the heart of downtown of a fairly large city. All sky scrapers and tight traffic on hundred year old infrastructure. Not what I signed up for, I specially said suburbs or rural routes where others get stuck in ruts. I text him and ask if its a downtown route and he says yes. I tell him I'm not coming. I call dispatch and nobody answers. So I head back, dispatch calls halfway back. But I'm not allowed to touch even my face while driving or I get points off. So when I stop to refill the van i call them again. Nobody answers. I go back and do my turn in keys and phone shit. Guy at desk is trying to threaten me with my ""job"" because I wouldn't go do another person's job but not get any extra pay for it.  So I stared mother fuckerly and said I don't give a shit. (He works for the DSP too not even an Amazon employee) so I got in my car and came home. Emailed my ""real boss"" the poor old lady about the deal. I asked if im ""fired"" (actually you just don't get any routes to do) then I need to know and I'll be in to get my check. Haven't heard back yet.",False,of6wfy,WartPig,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/of6wfy/my_story_as_an_amazon_delivery_driver/,25,1

How do you guys do it? 
I really want to resign from work but my mom’s business slowed down during this pandemic, my brother resigned from his work, and im the only one with a steady paycheck. I dont need to support them because they have their own money. 

I also have my own money but idk if i can bear taking 1 month off without getting anxious.

I have a high paying job and if i return to the workforce, i might be asked what i did for 1 month in between…

3645,"Feeling defeated - asked to work part-time, got denied","Hi everyone - hope you're all surviving and thriving in these never-ending chaotic times. I just wanted to take a minute to vent about how over the antiquated and exploitative 40-hour work week I am.

My job certainly isn't the worst job I've had, but they're finally making us go back to the office next week which I've been anxious about for months. I mustered up the courage to ask my boss if I could go part-time just to reclaim some of my life back (one day less a week, that's it) and was flat-out denied. 

My request was met with a barrage of ""I used to work 3 jobs and flip furniture on the side for extra cash"" bull shit that I didn't know how to respond to. I basically said, ""Good for you for hustling if that's what you wanted to do, but I just want more time to enjoy my life."" 

The thought of working this much for the next few decades has been weighing on me heavily lately. Time is the ultimate luxury and commodity and I feel like there's never enough. I want more time to explore the world, participate in the hobbies I love, read, learn and just LIVE.

3658,Crowdsourcing Idleness,"There’s a lot of discussion in this sub about how useful a general strike would be.  I agree.  I think the main problem facing us in getting one started is the collective action problem—we all want to, but how can we be sure others will join in?

I think the best way to get things rolling would be to raise a gigantic pot of money, invest it, and then target individual, highly visible companies by offering money to their lower level white collar workers to quit (by matching their salaries for a year).  Could perhaps limit it to the New York office of a big marketing firm or media company for visibility/efficiency.  It would require a shit load of money, but if it could be done, I think it would shock a lot of people and maybe get a useful conversation started.

3672,"A rant, and an essay.","The sentiment “work is work” is a bastardization of what it actually means to be a “worker”. Now, it goes without saying that there are variations to this topic; work can be many things, and what we do to make money is entirely relative. Each person has distinguished paths that determine how much they enjoy their job, how much they have to “work”, how well they are compensated, etc., etc. But this all goes without saying. A large portion of “work” that humans do is not just a simple job, a trivial, productive task we perform in order to contribute to society. We do things at our jobs that we would normally never do. I would never, and I mean never, vouch for a large corporation the way I do at my job. I would never, and I mean never, spend 40 hours a week in a dimly lit building surrounded by mass produced products created through slave labor. These character-breaking actions, of which there are many more than previously listed, belittle my spirit; to provide evidence of this would be pointless, because it is purely anecdotal. Except, it’s not. My feelings of hopelessness as a result of my “work” is shared by millions throughout the world; Mental Health America, a non-profit devoted to mental health issues in America, has quantified such evidence, determining that my workplace industry (retail) is one of the three workplace industries that score in the bottom 10% of occupations, alongside manufacturing and food and beverage (Cheang 1). Minimizing “work” by expressing a sentiment akin to “it’s just a job” completely degrades the millions of individuals that are being stripped of their humanity every day as a result of forced labor, that pushes said individuals to the point of mental and / or physical exhaustion.

The side effects of these jobs are overwhelming, with over 50% of employees in these workplace industries feeling unappreciated and looking for new jobs on a consistent basis (Cheang 1). These numbers have surely risen since the COVID-19 pandemic, with one study conducted in Arizona stating that of the 3,996 grocery union members who answered the questionnaire, “sixty percent of workers surveyed reported feeling above-average levels of stress. Thirty-seven percent reported feeling moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression (Hernandez 1)”. I could cite specific sources indulging us as to the reasons why these mental health issues have worsened, but I feel that to be unnecessary. Instead, recall an instance when you were browsing the shelves of a grocery store during the first six months of the pandemic. Recall the customers walking around without masks, grabbing things off of shelves carelessly and placing them in incorrect locations, and remember the instances when these individuals would communicate maskless to employees wearing their required PPE. Could you possibly imagine the sheer anxiety the employee would experience in such an absurd situation? A situation where a customer is putting the employee’s life at risk for reasons of stupidity, laziness, ideological maliciousness, or all of the above? Could you imagine the loss of faith, the adrenaline, the fatigue that would follow such an experience?

I could spend the next hour working on citing this little essay I’ve typed out. But honestly, I have nothing further to articulate in regards to quantitive evidence. The exploitation that service workers suspected was occurring for decades has since come to fruition; not only were we left on the frontlines of a life threatening virus unqualified and unprepared, but we were compensated monetarily the exact same as we were previous to these newfound obstacles. We never received more than a few scraps of our fair share of the profits. While every imperishable food and roll of toilet paper were selling in record high volumes for record high profits, we didn’t see more than a few hundred dollars in “thank you pay”. When we voiced our concerns regarding our own personal safety and the safety of those we love, we were told not to engage with the customers who would risk our lives for their laziness because “escalating conflict is never a good idea”. These fucking cowards that we call “management” bent their knee to the shareholders who wanted nothing more than to capitalize on panic buying, leaving us, the bottom of the barrel, the servants, the service workers, to deal with hoards of potential walking death sentences and the increased labor that coincided with the multiplied traffic.

And now, our “management” expects us to return to an era when our naivety was fruitful and easy, when we would allow customers to disrespect us to our faces because “work is work”. Never mind the psychological scars that occurred as a result of their greed. Never mind our still-thin bank accounts and directionless free time. Never mind our sustained exposure to the worst impulses that our consumeristic society has to offer, leaving us unable to look people in the eye due to distrust and disillusionment. “Work”, at least to those average enough to maintain a consistent employment status with a large-scale department store, is a malformed and dismembered existence that we are required to physically and mentally engage with for a third of our waking lives. “Work” is indentured servitude with a few amenities, amenities that do not compensate for the absolute discomfort that we are put subjected to for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.

You may say “There are people in this world that cannot eat, sleep in dirt, and are slaves in the literal sense of the word. Your life could be much worse than it presently is”. To this, I would respond: do you think so lowly of the human race that you truly believe this is the best we have to offer?",False,oeo2wm,Tower-Fair,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oeo2wm/a_rant_and_an_essay/,0,1

3693,"You can't simultaneously believe that it's fair for non-workers to have live with their parents, and also believe that it's unfair to make parents take care of non-workers.","I've made this same post about 1000 times and I never seem to get the wording right. My point is that if you believe that people who don't work deserve to be miserable and live with their parents against their will, you can't also hold the belief that forcing parents to take care of them is a. You can't both find a situation justified and and unjustified at the same time. 

If you think people who don't work deserve to suffer and live at home fine, but then you don't have the right to whine about getting your way. The consequences of your belief that non-workers don't deserve food, water and shelter is that parents all across the world will be forced to take care of them. If you think that is unfair, then stop supporting the system that thinks it's fine. 

If you believe that parent's shouldn't be forced to take care of their non-working adult relatives then you, just like us antiwork folk, aren't a supporter of the current structure. If you want to conserve the current structure, that is your choice, but please stop complaining about how your own idea works. You're getting your way. You think non-workers deserve to suffer, and the consequences of your immoral belief is that their parents will to. The more ""unfair"" you think the situation is, more right you're admitting we are. We know your system allows for some pretty horrendous shit. You don't need to remind us all day by crying about how you hate the circumstances your asked for. 

Remember. You most people hold the belief that not everyone deserves food. The consequences of that are that not everyone has food, and need help. It's their idea. It's their system. They're the ones suggesting we continue down the path of forcing parents to take care of non-working adults. They have made it clear they don't want to progress. So fine. Have fun taking care of us. I'll certainly never feel bad for the consequences of someone else's idea. I'm suggesting that my parents shouldn't have to take care of me. Society as a whole is saying nah, you deserve it.

I tried to think of ways I could completely bypass it, but unfortunately times up, and I have to work. This entire summer has been me stressing over jobs and my parents badgering me about getting a job. I feel like I've been sabotaging myself though by not applying for tons of jobs and not doing my best at interviews because I'm not ready to give up my freedom... that sounds dramatic, but I'm serious. There's no more going grocery shopping in the morning, hanging out with anyone throughout the day, or sitting around and doing hobbies I love. Now it's 9-5 (not even that maybe 7-5 considering the traffic), coming home to make dinner with only a few hours left until I have to wake up again, no more staying out late, sleeping over at my partners, etc. It all sounds miserable... being in the same place 9-5 not being able to enjoy a nice day. Not being able to hang out with friends as consistently because I'm most likely busy and tired from work and have to prepare for the next day.

I told my mom this and of course she said the usual cliche dismissive statement, ""Welcome to the real world"" followed by ""You'll love it when you start getting a paycheck"". She and my dad are both upset I don't have a job and I'm pretty sure my mom sees me as ""lazy"", she's called me that before. I seriously hate it... My plan is to really start looking for jobs within the next two weeks before my apartment lease is up next august and I have to move home. I give myself two weeks so I can enjoy my life before I basically go to prison.. again, dramatic but it's the truth. No amount of benefits, events, or friendly team will ever persuade me to want to work. And I don't want to hear the typical ""you have to have a more positive outlook"" or ""you can still do the things you enjoy you just have to have time management"". Everyone keeps telling me the same shit.... like yeah you don't think I know that? You think I don't know I need a job to survive? Man I fucking hate it. I don't want to work but I know I have to.

First, let's define ""tolerate"".  I can tolerate a baby crying on a plane for the couple hours of a flight.  Could you tolerate a crying baby, 9-6, 52 weeks a year? X to doubt my friend.

Some people are lucky and have jobs they not only like, but pay a livable wage.  Or, they have a well paying job with so little work that it can actually be defined as ""tolerable"".  This isn't the case, hence the fact that around [10% of the population is depressed](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/depression.htm), and those numbers are probably much higher based on antidepressant use.  

I think it's pretty damn simple.  If you DREAD (not ugh work on Monday) going in on Monday and you have anxiety, lose sleep, bedtime procrastinate etc... you DO NOT LIKE YOUR JOB.  Even if you had like 20 days of PTO, are you really telling me that one week off a quarter is worth being unhappy the other ~12 weeks?  (52/4 = 13.  13-1 week off is 12)  Just tolerate the metaphorical crying baby for 12 weeks, and then you don't have to for 1 week.

I have a boss who is really hands off, which usually I love. However, we have a monthly scheduled meeting, which never goes ahead unless I message to ask if it's happening.

I resent the fact that I'm perceived as lazy for not bothering to force a pointless meeting to go ahead, a meeting that has no benefit for either of us, especially when my boss clearly doesn't care either.

Nothing. Is. Working. 

Out of over 50 applications, I've received 3 callbacks, 2 interviews, and ZERO job offers. 

I got stood up for an interview today. I called their office, emailed their HR, and so far nothing. I had an interview scheduled for 8am and the interviewer didn't show up, and now no one from the company is answering me.

3752,Am I being unreasonable ?,"Ok so I'll try get to it quickly. My previous employer reached out to me (I'm working as a teacher in Asia) To do some cover work for two weeks. I live in a completely different city but as I had a decent relationship with my ex boss I agreed to help them out. I should also mention that it is all online.

When I was at the end of my first week and started teaching the materials I had planned out for that day, I then realized some of the kids were out of sync. Some of their books were very behind compared to others. I then sent a message to the person responsible for overseeing that level. They didn't get back to me until the end of the day saying there were five other books also behind and asked for me to help get them up to speed. I agreed. 
               The second week was their end of semester test. I did this and finished my last day. Then after my agreed working hours had passed, I receive a message to say they want me to mark the papers ( which they didn't send until the next day). Despite this seeming a bit outside of what was agreed I did and sent it back.
        Then today they send another message to ask if I can do their report cards complete with comments on each student that needs to be at least a certain number of paragraphs. Thing is I don't know these kids. Yes I've covered for the two weeks but I don't know what I would write that's worth noting to comment on their entire semester.

capable of this. And yet it didn't happen.
Instead, technology has been marshaled, if
anything, to figure out ways to make us all
work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have
had to be created that are, effectively,
painless. Huge states of people, in Europe
and North America in particular, spend their
entire working lives performing tasks they
secretly believe do not really need to be

3772,There's so much role playing that goes on in work culture,"When you really think about it, barely anyone has to do anything to make sure the food, water and shelter sources are working fine. Most people will never in their entire lives contribute directly to these things. Some people will, but not most. I think people know this to some degree, which is why they get so attached to the idea of something bigger than these three things. That's fine, I'd actually say that's a really good thing to see a bigger picture for humanity. The problem is that their bigger picture is mostly things like Disneyland, concerts, sports, video games, music, anime, fast food, fast cars, big houses ect.

The point is that humanity has reached a point where we no longer have to all worry about the most important things, and we can instead focus on fun and silly things. That's great, I'm all for it, but not if we're going to use these things as the determining factor as to whether they eat food or not. Making sure the rides at Disneyland are working correctly, and making sure food is grown for people are not on the same level of importance, and I refuse to be forced to do something that is not required by nature in order to earn something that is required and already taken care of. 

If you all want to do ""extra"" fun stuff, do it, but I'm not moving a muscle in a post scarcity society because the necessary work is already taken care of. I'm contributing exactly as much to the important stuff as every single other person who isn't contributing to them directly, which again, is literally most people. Most humans don't grow the food or build the houses, and unless you fall under one of those categories, humanity doesn't really ""need"" you, and I think our collective inability to accept this truth is a big reason people defend their unimportant jobs as important.

3791,Has anyone else successfully escaped the grind? Share your story?,"What drew me to this sub in the first place was having been out of the rat race long enough that I'm permanently horrified by the thought of going back to a ""normal job"".

The more I contemplate it, the more I realize how goddamn lucky I got.

I worked normal teenage jobs, babysitting etc., during high school in the U.S. Took CLEP tests to knock off as many college courses as possible. Started college at a community college on my own few hard-earned dimes, only to drop out several months in and spend my little remaining cash on a plane ticket to North Africa. Lived there for a couple years, supporting myself as a preschool English teacher, while learning Arabic.

Met a black American woman there who introduced me to the idea of online freelancing, and gave me a long list of online companies such as call centers, SEO companies, transcription companies, etc. that didn't require a degree or experience. Did SEO for a while as a side hustle with the English teaching, until they fired me for being in another country (against the rules, forgot to use a VPN a couple times), and then another side hustle as a transcriptionist for ASC Services LLC.

Returned to the U.S. and lived with my parents for a year, continuing to transcribe while finishing off my associate's degree at the community college (in general studies, no career ambitions with it, purely to make my mom happy for getting to see me walk), and then worked a minimum wage job at a used bookstore for a summer. Took the extra money from that and flew to another North African country, where my paltry U.S. dollars from transcription were enough to live off of.

Continued learning Arabic and happened upon Upwork by pure chance, where I decided to try out translation, having been lucky enough to grow up bilingual, and acquired two more languages since then. Built up good client reviews and enough of an income to quit transcription, and focus entirely on translation, earning enough to put well over $500 a month into savings after all living expenses, only working at \*most\* 15 hours a week.

Fell in love, got married, moved back to the U.S., husband works a 9-5 minimum wage despite being able to do the same translation I do, because he \*wants\* the routine and 'normalcy' of a ""9-5 outside the house like everyone else"", and I continue to translate, setting my own hours, my own prices, my own rules, and making enough in 15 hours of work a week to cover my share of the bills, savings, investments, and driving or jetting off where I want when I want, digital nomad style. I'll never be wealthy. I'll never have benefits or paid vacation/sick leave. But I consider those tiny, miniscule prices to pay for the nearly total freedom I enjoy. 

Example, I decided to fly off to Mexico and Belize last year just before Covid started, backpacked down to an island off of Belize, went snorkeling in the barrier reef, popped into a cyber cafe and paid for the snorkeling with 30 min of translating a Word doc, and continued like that the rest of the trip, road tripping through Mexico, jumping online at my nightly Airbnbs once in a while and turning a document around to pay for the next leg of the trip.

Sheer luck.

And I realize I've been ruined for ever returning to a ""normal job"" again, where I have to jolt myself awake at ungodly hours with an alarm clock every goddamn morning for the rest of my life, pack a lunch, show up, with no right to take off when I want without prior written authorization from a 'superior', submit to coporate scheduling and rules, make small talk with coworkers I didn't choose, eat in a gross artificially-lit lunchroom with an eye on the clock, with absolutely zero freedom to prioritize my mental and physical health when and how I want.

I don't know how people do it. I don't know how people like my husband have been brainwashed into thinking ""normal is good"" and \*wanting\* a ""career"". I hate the whole concept. I want to be outdoors in nature as much as possible, go where I want, when I want, with whom I want, never be forced to do or say anything. And still have disposable income. And somehow I stumbled ass-backwards into that life.

We deserve better. This is how we’re spending our LIVES. 

If your job has a problem, (too much on its plate or etc.) it’s your jobs problem, they trick you into making it your problem, they put pressure on you from the top down. It puts pressure where no pressure should be. A lot like a narcissist would. We’ve normalized being exploited. It used to be ok to beat your wife too.

Corporations are like entities, they live and exist through us, we feed them and keep them alive. You become your job while at work, “we offer... we don’t...” etc. Your individuality is expected to be left at the door.

3805,I did it: I quit my career,"During the pandemic, I realized that I was missing so much of my life due to the job. I’d worked hard in the legal field with a really high-stress job, and I was either in the office or attached to my phone 24/7. During the pandemic I began working from home, and I realized just how much of my family’s life I was missing. My 8 year-old daughter literally never saw me because I’d leave for work before she got up and I’d come home after her bed time most nights. The jobs I managed were inconsequential to the world, just ensuring that wealthy people stayed wealthy and all competition to them was crushed. We had a nice house in the suburbs of a major city and nice things, but I grew to hate my job and my lifestyle. 

A few months ago, my wife and I grabbed a bite to eat together in the middle of the day— something I would’ve NEVER done before the pandemic. But the time with her seemed much more valuable than any stupid job I was completing. We sat at an old diner and talked about our lives.

 *Sometimes, I think about leaving all of this behind and just working enough to make sure we have what we need.”* 

It was like a lightbulb went off. *Why not? What’s stopping us?”* 

For the next few months we set a plan in motion. We were going to sell the house, and I was going to use my skill set and education just enough to make sure we were comfortable. We were going to work from home, and relocate to be near family— something we gave up since we had to be near a certain major city to get the high paying job I sought after years ago. 

As of this post, we did it. We are renting a small house in the mountains near my wife’s family, with whom we are very close. We used the profit from selling our big suburban home to buy a little but of land and to pay for a small home just large enough for our little family of three. Much to the shock of my employers, I quit my job. I started a small firm dedicated to using my skills to help others in a much more fulfilling way, and one that will provide a steady stream of income. I’ve gotten to know my daughter, which is something so valuable I’d give up everything for. My wife and I are closer than we’ve ever been, and our relationship has improved so much. 

I’m…happy. For the first time in my adult life. I’m not straining to achieve the next big thing. I’m content with what we have, and I’m learning to enjoy simplicity.

Disclaimer: I know that so many people out there won’t have the opportunity to do this, and I recognize how incredibly lucky we are to be in this position. This isn’t to brag at all, but to encourage anyone who may be in a similar position To what I was in before we simplified our lives. Take the leap, and break out from the dystopia our country is in. Take time to value what and who you love. The day after I quit my job, someone else was in my position. Employers don’t care about you, but your family does.

Frankly, I don't understand why he works to begin with, his parents give him an incredibly generous allowance, his sister has a fairly successful onlyfans (not a joke) and he's from a generally wealthy family overall, he's also still in secondary school and doesn't wish to become anything in the future but a ""pornstar who exclusively interacts with trans women (Of course he went in more detail)."" I don't understand why he wants to become a pornstar, maybe he's hoping to finally get laid but I won't judge, it's 2021 after all. Any adivce/help to help him cope would be appreciated.

3832,"A year ago, I lost the will to work","I used to work in a call center for several years, and it was the only job I ever really worked in my adult life. Things were what you would expect from a call center, but for the most part things were tolerable because of the comradeship with coworkers sharing the bad experience with you every day. When COVID struck, we switched to WFH and I thought it was great at first. That was until it all went bad. Management was abusive towards us, the calls were getting stressful and I couldn’t get supervisor help oftentimes on urgent calls and would end up getting abused by customers too. On top of this there was no one to vent to, and all of the problems from work were now in my living area. Meanwhile, a lot of my friends were enjoying life on the 600/week while all I got for all of my hard efforts was an extremely bloated electricity bill from running my computer and phone lines for 9 hours per day. 

It was then that I broke.

My work ethic and performance went down the drain, and I did the bare minimum that was required of me. All of my performance metrics at the job tanked, and within 3 months the company had pink slipped me for unsatisfactory performance. I’ll note that I wasn’t ever nasty to people on the phones during this time, I just stopped rushing through things so my stats ranked that way. 

I collected UI and realized that human beings don’t deserve to be treated like garbage for a pittance. There is so much more that humanity deserves than a 9-5 where you get abused by someone all day. Humans deserve to travel and love and laugh and not have to slave away the majority of their lives hoping that they’ll have some money to maybe do something when they are 65. 

I resolved during this time that I would try to live my life young and happy. Sadly, at least for now I probably will have to return to the work force in some way because I am not so fortunate to have a lot of money around to not work. But it is my hope that someday soon I can become independent and travel, not be confined to an office and someone else’s authority, and enjoy life at it’s face value.",False,oellrm,NoHuckleberry7642,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oellrm/a_year_ago_i_lost_the_will_to_work/,5,1

Plumbing literally entails digging through shit on certain occasions and dealing with less than hygienic situations on a daily basis. Plumbing is also extremely important to people's health and safety, and those without it face horrible diseases and filthy living conditions. You could ask some plumbers if they enjoy their work and some would say they take pride in their craft and helping people, but an extremely small percentage wouldn't say they love digging through other people's shit.

I have a new boss who promised me a bonus and the significant pay raise that I requested. But that was in April. 10 weeks later I learn we have budget issues and I should not expect that promised bonus or raise in the near term. Yet they are planning to hire to fill the empty colleague spot at the significantly higher pay rate that I originally requested. I am galled.

Tomorrow I’m going to ask for a status update on my requests, and remind them (in a corporate-appropriate way) that I need to be paid what I am worth. I hate that I can’t say I will quit if I don’t get my requests. I can’t afford to be seen as a bad employee, given that I must have a job to pay my bills. Hooray for wage slavery.

I’ve been applying for new jobs since March. I’ve been through 20 applications and four final interviews, the most recent late last week. If I’m lucky enough to land a new job, I’m not planning to give my current job two hours notice, much less two weeks.

[This recent Kurzgesagt video](https://youtu.be/JXeJANDKwDc) motivating us to use our time well because we will die soon just never acknowledges how work is the reason we just toil and can't live our lives. I love their science-based approach to videos but this is disappointing. Thoughts?

My thoughts :

❗️ what about delving deeper and exposing the fact that paid work that is necessary to make a living and simply have something to eat is the product of neoliberal unfettered capitalism and it's the extremely painful and sad reason why humans actually CAN'T spend their lifetimes doing things they want to do - be it science, art or just spending time with their family? 

However, the money is here for all of us to work much, much less - if it were distributed and unlimited growth and extreme unequality were not the absolute foundations of this toxic system. 

➡️ I absolutely do KNOW how I want to spend my lifetime and hours of the day, yet I can't because the absolute majority of our waking hours are spent by commuting and working and recovering from work + doing chores.

Unemployment benefit

 

if the unemployment rate starts declining, and
their model’s telling them it’s very close to, or
has fallen below, the resumed “natural” level,

they'll lift interest rates to “take some heat out
of the economy.

That’s a euphemism for pushing the
unemployment rate higher, or slowing the
economy down.

It’s often the same thing.

But there’s been a real-world cost to that
policy.

By preventing the unemployment rate from
falling below its resumed “natural” level,
they’ve been using hundreds of thousands of
unemployed Australians as shock absorbed.

Those unemployed people have been assigned
to Team Inflation Control without their

3891,This might not be perfect but hear me out. How about rewarding effort instead of result? -The Junaidian ideology,"I've seen way too many comments and posts on other subreddits saying all r/antiwork does is complain,i.e, they don't have any solutions so I'm posting my idea here. The main reason people hate working is because they are working for someone else. Just a few minutes ago I saw another post, which says that people aren't mad to work to support a family waiting for a stimulus but they hate it when they have to work for a guy wanting to buy a 3rd mega yatch. Obviously, I get it. Why would you want to work to death to make someone else richer? Then I thought, if I'm the one putting in so much effort, shouldn't I be the one entitled to benefits? That's when I thought how different society would be if we started rewarding effort instead of result. We could set up a system where a committee decides and rates various forms of effort (by deciding how 'effortful' a job is). Everyone who does a certain amount of effort/week (the threshold effort)(effort must be beneficial to the society)(Can be in the form of any service to the society), is eligible to a weekly reward, say x amount of credits. These credits will be enough to provide for a week's worth of basic necessities like food/shelter etc..  Now, I know the effort deciding committee will have a lot of influence and too much power so a workaround would be de-localizing governance-related jobs, i.e.,  instead of offering jobs, any services that help in direct administration/governance will be grouped into 'job categories' and the jobs will be offered on a cyclic basis every week. People can choose whatever job category they want. The jobs provided to them will change on a weekly basis. They'd still have to put in the same amount of effort each week no matter what job they work to be eligible for the threshold reward.

Threshold effort:

I figured I can explain this better (why threshold effort is needed and how it is decided). 
Any society needs working human beings doing various jobs to support it like farming/healthcare/governance/education/emergency services (police/fire control etc..). Let's say all of these combined, require 100 units of effort/week. If at this point of time, assume 50 people make up our working population, the threshold effort would be 2 units of effort/week/person. An individual can choose to work whatever job he/she wants. There will be no discrimination because all members would still earn equally every week.





This type of society will solve the following problems:

1.Unemployement due to automation

A lot of people are losing jobs because they were replaced by machines. That's just foolish because if humanity has enough potential to reduce the workload it's been put through, people should be happier and more resources will now be available since many more people are free. However, contrary to that logic many people are suffering today from automation because they are tossed aside as their jobs are now automated. This problem will be solved because automation will decrease the amount of threshold effort therefore, everyone will still have work, except they'll just have to work less and be entitled to the same threshold reward since they no longer have to work as much as they used to. The machines worked instead of them and took work off everyone's shoulders. A concern one might raise here is 'if automation in one sector takes jobs away, how are people, who only know how to work in that sector going to reach their threshold?'
Well, I'm thinking people have job categories right? They don't have to confine themselves to one single job. They can earn effort in any category as long as they are qualified to do that job. Like say they can offer sanitary services and clean up their own neighborhood. They'll still get rewarded for that effort and sanitary jobs won't be looked down on because they take a lot of effort and hence will have a higher pay/hour rate. Doesn't mean the job itself is better than other jobs because other jobs will earn you effort too. Just at a slower rate. What I'm trying to say is, all jobs have an equal effort to pay rate. It's just, sanitary jobs demand a lot of effort and hence the threshold effort is met in a short time. The amount of effort you would do every week is the same. Some jobs just have you put that effort over a more dispersed time and some demand that effort all at once. Even if they don't prefer sanitation, they can still go for similar jobs from their job category. The big win here is less available jobs = less threshold effort and hence easier weeks for everyone. In normal capitalist societies, less available work = unemployment and provision of resources to only those who cater to those jobs. In this society, available jobs are given out equally to all the members and hence everyone becomes eligible to the reward. The society won't go bankrupt because the work is still getting done, just by machines. Let me use a simple example. Say farming just got automated, now, instead of farmers losing jobs, the net threshold effort will decrease and everyone will have to work less every week. The farmer can choose to earn his/her effort via other services/jobs in his/her job category or any category he/she is qualified to work in. The community won't lose anything because the farming work is still getting done, just by machines and not humans.


2.Job based societal status will be invalidated

All jobs have an equal effort to pay rate. It doesn't matter what job you choose to work. No job is 'better' than other jobs because in the end, all of them will demand the same effort/week and give out the exact same pay.

3.No income inequalities

All income will be decided on how much effort you have put in the society's benefit. No one will benefit off others working to death. There are a few complications here like we might need to restrict credit transactions but honestly, I'm too inexperienced to think about it all on my own. Ofc, I do have a solution of my own but I'm worried it might be too restrictive so I thought it would be better if I got external opinions and community suggestions on this. Let's think about this together.


Although the benefits look promising, no society is perfect and the same applies to this too. However, just because an idealogy has problems doesn't mean we should completely abandon it, right? Let's try listing as many potential problems as possible and solve them. I've listed a few below.

Possible concerns/FAQ:

1.What about income differences generated from Companies?

2. What if people want to make more money?

Answer by Pathan Azeez Khan for both questions: 

If any one wants to make more money after already earning their threshold reward, they can do so by working for private companies (Walmart, Google, or by starting their own company) and private household services (maids, running errands, etc..). All companies will be required to pay their employees on an effort basis and the effort that goes into their tasks will be rated by a small drafting committee that evaluates the effort for each company and if required, each special task. The company will also sell it's product based on the effort it has put into it. Their product can be sold at a higher price than what it cost the company to make because the company has paid all its employees on an effort basis but the profit margin shall not exceed a set percentage to make sure the company isn't ripping people off. For example, say a company of 10 employees, owned by a single 11th person makes 50 products a week. The cost of each product, will be [(credits the company payed to its employees + other company expenditure)/(no. of products)] + a small profit. So if the employes spent 100 units of effort in making those 50 products, the company will pay all its employees for the 100 effort units, the same pay they would get if they worked for the government or its essential services. Say the pay came out to be 100 credits for each employee. Therefore, the company can charge 100*10/50 + profit and set the price to 22 credits per piece. That way, the owner can earn 22*50 =  1100 credits in total. Subtracting the employees' salaries, the owner and the employees would've made a 100 credit profit for their efforts. I haven't thought of any means to decide on the profit part in the above equation so I can use reddit's help here as well but as a general rule of thumb, for now, let's say it is 5% of the company total expenditure. Note that for simplicity, it's been assumed that the company's only expenditure is the employee salary.",False,oe1p0p,CheeseHalloween,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oe1p0p/this_might_not_be_perfect_but_hear_me_out_how/,30,1

3903,Capitalism (and hence work culture) causes mental illness-thus violent crime happens.,"The very system which dominates our lives is causing severe brain damage in random pockets of society particularly the poor. This brain damage occurs in areas of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. Literally, people who undergo strong stress from say loss of finances or home security or perhaps by being raised by abusive conditions lose the ability to control themselves. 

Every person experiences consciousness through these neurons firing together in the brain. If the prefrontal cortex is shot. Then the person will literally be unable to prevent antisocial behavior. If the amygdala is shot then the person will be either super fearful or not fearful at all. Combined this can cause violent criminal behavior.

Work is stressful. And it is unnecessarily so. You need money. Everyone does. Sometimes there isn't enough of it and you and your family suffer for it. This stress turns off the prefrontal cortex and then BAM. You lose that ability to impulse control. Then coupled with alcohol/drug you may impulsively and inevitably make a bad decision that is stressful to other people. Now they become stressed. This ripples throughout society and given the wrong conditions can create the most extremely violent humans among us who in turn continue the harm.

I'm not saying violent behavior will ever stop in a better system--but Capitalism is not making it any better. I think we can all agree Capitalism is stressful even for rich assholes.--Even proponents of Capitalism have that ""tough shit life's hard"" attitude to reflect Capitalism's stressors.

It is clear to me. Abolish Capitalism and replace it with something less stressful and I bet you'd see a massive drop in violent crime. Make the new system so you don't die of starvation or lose a home if you don't have some obscure number on some bank computer somewhere.

3909,Thanks antiwork this sub help change my life for the better!,"Well I've always battled to find work, not enough experience wrong color skin not as desperate to get payed nothing.

I hated the whole capitalistic institution and paid slavery as you all do.

I finally was convinced into taking a terrible minimum wage job. I was promised I would move up but instead they retrenched us all to save a couple bucks.

Well during that time, I was spoken to so badly, treated like shit my own close friend who was indirectly above me, i took abuse on he chin you cant even imagine. As long as I live I will NEVER forget the disrespect I endured all while trying to be as nice as I can as a means to an end.

I fantasized about getting a higher paying job which I was qualified for and somehow making my life work.

Well it didn't.

After leaving I joined reddit looking for tips on how to find the right job. I ended up coming across this sub. The knee jerk reaction was what a terrible way to look at life. You need a job dont you?

Well I remained unemployed taking shit interviews as discussed in this sub, nothing new there. 

Well when Corroba hit my mom rented me a tiny bat pad and are I lived on my own with my dog.

This is where I found peace and happiness, I meditated played xbox, t fucked up whenever I wanted. It was great. However I was still haunted by how I was treated, ashamed.

One brave day I made a blood path promise to myself. I decided I dont care if I'm never wealthy or successful I dont care if I never touch a women again, I dont care what people thought of me. FUCK THEM.

However my promise was I was never going to take a lick of shit ever again from anyone. Never work again and I will only do exactly what I want at any given moment in my life. Simple.

I'm legally disabled. My plan was to go on disability and my family could support me to an extent. I had excepted this. I was at peace with this.

Here I found peace in the first time in my life. Great. I continued my spiritual studies and I refused to take shit.

I stopped always saying sorry, stopped explaining myself. Life changed almost immediately.  I had learned to finally respect myself. What a win, more than I could have ever imagined.

I often pondered the evils of capitalism and these losers working as paid slaves taking shit and selling there souls. I understand capitalism I studied business and marketing, however I've always despised the system and the rich fucks that run it.

Well I like playing games. Along with my new found self respect I started putting myself first. Fuck people I need to look after number one first.

I had a flash of a funny idea...

I thought t myself...wouldnt it be hilarious if I ended up becoming filthy fucking rich in spite of everything? 

I knew how the system worked, I read all the books 15 years ago. Shit ain't rocket science. I never persuade it because I disposed the system.

I said fuck it. Instead of playing boxing on xbox I'll play business boss millionaire. It will be my new game.
Long story short after 3 months of research mock sales, ghost reping to raise seed money and product sourcing I began my business. 

2 months  I had earned more in 23 days than EVER I had in a month of working.

I wouldnt even call myself my own boss. I hate bosses why would I do that to myself? Following the rules I swore to govern my life to, I never did businessmen I didn't feel like it and never took shit from customers. 

My business is aggressively expanding it is quite scary actually. I'm fucking amazed 

I shit you not the people that now work for ME and customers only refur to me as Sirand Boss. Please and thank you.

It is shocking.

If a customer is short or rude to me unknowingly i ask or the magic word. 95% of the time they appologies and carry on there Enquiry, anything less I simply state  ""no sale"".

I dont go out looking for customers, they all come to me.

The kicker is I dont even want anything, I'm happy with my life in my little studio apartment. Just me and my dog.

I cant think of anything I really want other than MORE MONEY. Simple. More points won in my game of capitalist pig. Why you ask? For fun. It a rush like mo other ring someone hand over there money to you...

They do it with a smile on there face. I make people happy.

Just going around and around in the wheel, as it were. I can't tolerate this feeling, I start to spiral. I get moody, short-tempered and overly-apathetic about life in general.

One day in particular I was feeling this, acutely. So, immediately, I filled out a leave request slip for a four-day weekend. Instantly, I felt a bit better. **I was in control**, as if I was taking back some sanity. Something so seemingly trivial like a long weekend has a ""healing"" effect, especially after so long without any extra time off. Although the numbness does creep back every week, I thank myself for taking the initiative.

I encourage anyone reading this to give yourself a little goal. Even if it's one day extra, it could be the day that prevents a complete breakdown. We so frequently neglect our mental health. We carry on with internal dialogue such as, ""It's just a bad week, it'll pass and tomorrow will be better"". Denial is a powerful beast that *must* be reckoned with. It's important to recognise the signs and emotions that accompany it.

Work is a stark reality for now - the best thing we can do for ourselves is to **not forget** our *own needs* outside of monetary necessity. Find time for YOU. You're worth more than a wage.

Thank you for being here for each other. I love and respect you all. Don't forget: *Mind your own business*.",False,odye62,N-K-91,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/odye62/the_importance_of_having_something_to_look/,7,1

Is America’s job market rebound this
summer and the need for workers
intensified, employers won’t likely have a
chance to relax daytime soon. Worker
shortage will likely persist for years after
the fast-reopening economy shakes off its
growing pains.

Consider that the number of working age
people did something last year it had never
done in the nation’s history: It shrank.

Estimates from the Census Bureau showed
that the U.S. population ages 16 through 64
fell 0.1% in 2020 — a scant drop but the first
decline of any kind after decades of steady
increases. It reflected a sharp fall in
immigration, the retirement of the vast
baby boom generation and a slowing birth
rate. The size of the 16-64 age group was also
diminished last year by thousands of deaths
from the coronavirus.

Ideally, I’m a fan of the idea of a Star Trek like world that doesn’t use currency at all, but I know that’s not realistic (at least not in my lifetime). 

Eventually though, many jobs will be largely automated, leaving a large portion (I freaking hate the term “unskilled worker”) of the population jobless. That plus the inevitable population boom of the next 100 years means we need to stop tying essential items like food, housing, water, (healthcare in the US), etc to income.

I’m a bit skeptical about universal healthcare because it’s still supporting a currency-driven system that emphasizes wage/class gaps and benefits the few at a cost to the many. But I’m also a fan of meeting that bottom layer of everyone’s hierarchy of needs regardless of their participation in this hellscape of unfettered capitalism.

Deputy Mayor Jorge Blas Fernandez began making inquiries that led him to discover that Garcia had not been seen at his office in six years.Reached by the newspaper *El Mundo*, unnamed sources close to Garcia said he devoted himself in the years before 2010 to studying the writings of Spinoza, a seventeenth-century heretic Jew from Amsterdam. One source interviewed by *El Mundo* said Garcia became an expert on Spinoza but denied claims Garcia never showed up for work, saying he came in at irregular times.

This story made headlines in Spain. At a time when the country was undergoing severe austerity and high unemployment, it seemed outrageous that there were civil servants who could skip work for years without any- body noticing. Garcia’s defense, however, is not without merit. He explained that while he had worked for many years dutifully monitoring the city’s water treatment plant, the water board eventually came under the control of higher-ups who loathed him for his Socialist politics and refused to assign him any responsibilities. He found this situation so demoralizing that he was eventually obliged to seek clinical help for depression. Finally, and with the concurrence of his therapist, he decided that rather than just continue to sit around all day pretending to look busy, he would convince the water board he was being supervised by the municipality, and the municipality that he was being supervised by the water board, check in if there was a problem, but otherwise just go home and do something useful with his life.",False,oe6bma,SuperEnthusiastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oe6bma/the_heroic_story_of_the_spaniard_who_skipped_work/,2,1

3978,Tipping Out / Rant,"This is by far one of the most annoying things about being a server. Every night, I'm expected to give a minimum of 25% of my tips away to other employees despite the fact that I only make $2.50 an hour. Everyone else is payed $10 to $11 an hour, and tips are supposed to be my paycheck. I even have to give tips to the bar tenders, who make a stable hourly rate AND their own tips (and they are not required to tip out). It just feels so unfair; I'd understand pooling the tips if I got payed the same as everyone else, but I don't. People threaten to sabotage your service or report you if you don't give them what they consider ""enough"", even if you're following restaurant guidelines. It's honestly blackmail. On top of everything, a large cut of my tips gets taken out for taxes.  Last night I made $200, but had to give away $57, and then it gets taxed 20%.

3988,Strikes Like Never Before,"I get it, coordinating massive nation wide, even state wide strikes is quite the task.  
But I have been thinking.  
If we can just start one business at a time, one neighborhood at a time, a day, a week at a time we might actually be able to do this.  


Sure as an individual we wage peons are replaceable. Right now, however, anyone and everyone - nearly - is struggling for labourers as it is. So now is the time to \*ahem\* strike for what we want.  
Work at a dollar store? That means organizing, like, four dudes/ettes.   
Work in a restaurant? Maybe like seven.  
Walmart might be a bit more difficult.  


The major issue is that these people doing this will require support for some period while we're taking back what's ours. Which means - I imagine - organizing a handful more people to sponsor each individual during these strikes. Hell maybe a go-fund-me would work. There are enough people on this sub-reddit to pitch in even a quarter each and we can get this going.  


Then as each locality leverages their labour against their employer in this way, they can pay it forward several fold because they've availed themselves of their daily wage peonage (ideally).

4010,Life tip - use up as much time on the clock as possible demanding a good raise before you leave your job.,"Before you quit or preferably get fired so you can get your unemployment check, please be smart. Waste as much of your company’s time as possible in your manager(s) office complaining about how they pay you peanuts and that you need a living wage. Remind them that they promised you you could grow with the company. Remind them of how you go above and beyond for the company every day and how they need to be loyal to you with a raise. Make them feel terrible. Make them listen to you. These boomers running these businesses like it’s 1981 need to hear it. They need to hear that they’re going to lose their professional staff and go under if those professionals can earn more stocking frozen crabs at Walmart or working a drive through than they can selling expensive makeup and skincare in a major US department store. 

I work at a JCPenney and last week I got caught in traffic and was approximately one minute late for my shift. One minute. The store manager was already waiting at my department register for me to clock in with the most pissy expression on her face. Standing there unhelpfully watching me instead of helping while a lower level supervisor opened the registers. I nodded at her, clocked in, took my time as I put my things away in a drawer, and finally looked her directly in the face. She loudly asks so nearly the whole first floor could hear “What is going to motivate you to come to work on time?” And I just as loudly replied “Well gee (managers name), a living wage and not laughing in my face when I asked for a raise would motivate me.” I had recently asked two other managers for a raise and they both told me there’s no raises in JCPenney. Keep in mind in my hiring interview and for months afterwards I was promised a decent promotion and supervisor position paying around $20/hr, and even though they never promoted me and deleted the position from all locations I am still required to do tasks of that position without extra pay since I am now trained. She demanded I go to her office with her and long story short I got paid a good hour to fight with her in her office about their empty promises of a living wage, and how she has the entire store (minus her) living below the poverty line. Most of the staff in our store make $9 hourly, some make $12 at most, and almost all of us are working 40 hour weeks with no benefits or PTO. She told me I should not be discussing wages with other employees and I replied that her telling me that is  actually illegal which shut her up briefly. She then tried to make me end the conversation by lying to me that she only makes $4/hourly because she works 60 hours a week on a 40 hour salary. She told me I clearly have poor work ethic because I’m demanding a raise that would put my company out of business. It was an unbelievably terrible argument. First of all either this lady can’t complete her work assignments in 40 hours or JCPenney is such a terrible company that they give their employees 60 hours of work and only pay them for 40. Also, if $15-$18 hourly is going to cause one of the biggest stores in the US to close down, well, maybe the company is just terrible and has too many problems to have any business being open. She thought my demand for at least $15/hr was the most ridiculous thing she’s ever heard, even though thats going to be the minimum wage in 3 years in my state. I’m the #5 credit earner in the store making her god knows how much bonus money in her paycheck every month and she won’t even pay me an extra couple dollars so I can afford a used car or my own place. It’s sick and retail is a miserable place to live. At least I’ve gotten paid 3 hours of this companies time in meetings with 3 different managers demanding raises, insulting the companies empty promises, and complaining about their slave wages (the exact words I used).",False,odduq0,eyes_like_matcha,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/odduq0/life_tip_use_up_as_much_time_on_the_clock_as/,5,1

4013,Do You Know How Much A 15min Break Costs Your Company?!,"As my username states, I am a machinist. 
We get calls all the time from companies wanting us visit and to look at a few parts. This one place called last week. We’ve never done business with them before, so I figured this would be a great opportunity to get our foot in the door. 
When I walked through their visitor doors, I was slapped in the face with what I can only describe as the overwhelming smell of mold. Water puddles everywhere. 1/2 of the lighting in the entire building was out. Dead birds on the ground from where they hit support beams and fans and died. And the drop ceiling had partially collapsed into the floor. None of which was picked up and had visible signs of mold. Keep in mind this is a billion dollar corporation. The machine they wanted me to look at was right by the break room. Beside every door and window was the same poster stapled to the wall, inside and outside of the break room. (Forgive me because I don’t remember the exact numbers). The posters read:
“Do You Know How Much A 15min Break Costs Your Company?! The average worker makes $X/hr. If Y Number of People take a 15min break, that costs the company $X. Please take into consideration the costs and take ONLY a 15min break.” Talked to a few employees, and they work 12-15hr shifts, 5-6 days a week, with a single 15min break and a 30min lunch. 3/4 of an hour rest for a 15hr shift. When I got back to the shop, I got a price on material, drew up a program (waived the programming fee), and got a machine time. Against the owner’s wishes, I did not, “charge the hell out of them.” I priced it to where it covered material and labor, and that’s basically it. The guy called back, “I think you made a mistake. The other companies that quoted this wanted 5x more. And I said, “ideally, I would have. But seeing the working conditions, I figured you needed the extra money to upgrade your facility or give your employees and extra break.” Needless to say, we didn’t get the job, and I lost my paid 30min lunch breaks that week, but it was 100% worth it.",False,odmkft,Machinist23,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/odmkft/do_you_know_how_much_a_15min_break_costs_your/,19,1

4015,Jobs That Try to Fire Workers Over A Workplace Injury/Worker’s Comp,"   Yesterday, I took my mother out for dinner, and upon going to dinner, we talked about life and work and such. During our conversations, she revealed her neck injury and how her getting injured is about to get her fired.

  My mother and the people she were working with were supposed to move this box. This box is too heavy for my mom and a team lift would better suit the situation; so she asked the people in her crew to help her. Her crew said “no we are about to go to lunch, you need to do it yourself.” The crew then go on their two hour lunch break, yes two hours while my mother tries to move the box.

     While trying to move the box, my mother suddenly felt the sharpest pain she’s felt in a minute within her neck. This pain was so sharp, that she said that it physically hurts now to move her arm because of her neck. My mother took this opportunity to file for worker’s compensation.

     Higher ups at her company heard of this and are pissed off and are, as they said, “investigating her for worker’s retaliation” and are trying everything they can from not having to pay that worker’s compensation. Ironically, not too longer later in the same week, my mother’s co-worker gets injured and she helped him file for worker’s compensation too which has made the company even angrier at my mother. Thankfully, she has documented everything so far and even secretly recorded full blown conversations of them planning to fire her!

    My mother is thankfully lawyering up and getting prepared to take the company on to court as she has realized exactly what they plan on doing so they won’t have to pay her for worker’s compensation.



I understand companies don’t want to lose money because they have to pay compensation, but DUDE INJURIES HAPPEN IN LIFE AND WE SHOULD NOT fire workers for injuries that have come from the job!

&gt;This is very similar to when I was working at Amazon. Amazon fulfillment centers will have banners saying something like “We have gone however many days without a workplace injury.” Which is THE GREATEST LIE EVER TOLD! Amazon hates worker’s comp and will fire workers, so if you get injured, they rush you to their on site doctor called “AmCare” that can only do so little as they are not a hospital. Amazon will then try to their damn hardest to cover up said injury  to prevent an OSHA investigation because the media will eat them alive! At my fulfillment center, we had MANY INJURIES that they covered up so people couldn’t get worker’s comp or nothing!
&gt;This is the same Amazon who less than two months after they gave worker’s hazard pay during Covid, took it away, claiming “our warehouses have become increasingly safer during Covid so our workers don’t need the extra pay boost!” This whole statement they released is funny considering every day, EVERY DAMN DAY, me and every other worker were getting amazon texts that multiple new people have got Covid!

4023,I had a temp Christmas job at an Amazon warehouse and they finessed everyone to work harder and never call in sick.,"So in the area I lived in the UK amazon was actually the highest paying employeer for low skilled workers at £11.21/hour for night shift employees.

On our first day our manager stood up and gave a speach to all the new starts about how he had also started working as a temp (green badge) and worked his way up and if we worked hard we could emulate him and get our blue badge (permanent employee).  He gave this speach to every intake.

Everyone who works there except receiving uses a handheld device to work which monitors your activity and starts beeping if you don't have any activity after a few minutes. After training you start your first day and at the end of the shift you are told your stats and immediatly how well you have done compared to other new starts.  After that initial training you're set loose and basically told that the top workers will get the blue badges and poor workers will be fired.  They start rumours that the workers who have left were fired because they were too slow, I know this because a manager told me that someone I used to speak to was let go for being too slow, but when I found him on facebook he told me that he simply found another job.

This blue badge nonsense and oppertunities to go far in Amazon become a mantra for people desperate for a job and they work incredibly hard.  It creates a lot of tension and reckless behaviour, you see people pushing heavy carts at lightning speed everywhere to boost their statistics.  People fight over good jobs and there is literally internal corruption between different roles in the warehouse so the stackers can get good trolleys.  One dude even asked for blowjobs for good trolleys it's that bad and there is a major conflict between the Romanians and the Africans for control of the trolleys.

Eventually they give 30 people blue badges, but 2 weeks later they take them away.  They fire 90% people 2 weeks before Christmas and in the end at the end of holiday season they take on ZERO blue badges.",False,odrxh0,Warning-Novel,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/odrxh0/i_had_a_temp_christmas_job_at_an_amazon_warehouse/,21,1

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

g~we""

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

e Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

e Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

e Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

e Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

e Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

Of 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100

minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

 

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

The stress and unhappiness caused by this creates a ripple effect that can extend into all areas of life, and therefore out into the rest of the world.

4066,Workers rights in the US: The single biggest issue we should be focused on,"Why the f\*\*ck have we in the United States not organized and voted for politicians who will make real changes in labor law in regards to paid time off and healthcare?

The science is pretty clear; that we are a very stressed out and mentally unhealthy nation, and a lot of that is due to the fact we are all over here grinding 24/7 365 days a year getting screamed at by some maniac boss without a vacation. And without our toxic soul sucking glorified indentured servitude ""jobs"", we have no healthcare and no ability to not go into massive medical debt for things like cancer, Covid, heart problems, and whole hosts of issues that aren't our fault.

As most of you are probably aware, in most European countries, they work 32-40 hour weeks and have guaranteed 5-6 weeks vacation. Yes, they get taxed more, but its pretty much irrelevant in my opinion. They don't need the money due to all their social services. Their quality of lives are higher.

I have a good job here in California, all things considered. 6 figures + benefits. Unfortunately it is borderline breaking my mental health with the stress. I'm getting screamed at weekly by my boss who micromanages our every key stroke and watches us work on the cameras when he isn't in. I have 15 days PTO to use between vacation and sick days, but we are so busy that my boss gives us mad shit if I even use my vacation. He's literally a psychotic maniac from hell and our whole office looks out the windows to see when his car rolls up to work because we know shits about to go down every morning. He's an owner, so he is the boss of HR. There's literally nothing I can do about it other than take it or quit. And to get to this point I worked through a whole host of shitty jobs like scraping gum off of sidewalks, washing dishes, and loading UPS trucks in the 100 degree summer heat.

I just watched my buddy get his first job out of college with a 4 year STEM degree. He had no healthcare and needed something. His first job only gets 5 days off a year total. That's it. No extra sick days. No unpaid leaves. He has to be there 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year. If he takes 1 day off because he needed a mental health day, that means no week long vacation for the entire year. I know there are jobs out there that have it even worse, with zero days off.

The point of this isn't to get in a pissing contest about how hard your job is or how much you work... or for someone to come out and say I should be grateful for my job. Because all of that is just some version of Stockholm Syndrome. We need to vote for better workers rights.

4076,Advice for those who want to escape oppressive work environments,"I have seen numerous calls for people to share more actionable ideas on how to enact antiwork values in their life.  I don't think there are any easy answers, but I wanted to share a strategy that I think can help. This is from the perspective of the US job market, and might not translate well to other areas of the world.

First, it is important to recognize that similarly to consumption there is no ethical/non-oppressive wage labor under capitalism. This isn't meant as a total solution to escaping work, but instead a pragmatic strategy to help have better working conditions and a better work/life balance.

Cast aside the idea that your manager or boss will ever create a path for you to escape wage labor. The best they will do is give you token raises that don't keep up with the cost of living. In order to find a livable existence as a wage worker you will need to use the collective power of workers to bargain and fight for you. Start by looking at skilled trades in your area. Most have paid apprenticeships and training you can use to get started. Look at government and university work (custodial, tech support, USPS mail carrier, package sorting, etc). Most of those jobs are unionized and get a livable wage and regular cost of living adjustment.

Of course, this is easier said than done. All of these types of jobs can take months if not years to get into. But why not start now? If you are going to keep working an oppressive job for now anyway you can take the opportunity to hatch an escape plan. Apply at one of those programs or jobs a month and just see what happens. In the meantime you can join the IWW (member dues are sliding scale), learn about labor organizing, and network with other members to find out about better opportunities. 

Again, this isn't a total escape from the awful weight of capitalism, but it is a reasonable way to get good pay, excellent work/life balance, great benefits, a path to actually retire, and a pool of workers willing to go to bat for you if your employer tries heinous shit.

It took me 2 years to land this type of position. It wasn't really hard work to get it. It just took time as those organizations run slow. I just kept trying over and over again. I weekly checked union and government institution job boards (those places usually don't post on indeed and other popular hiring sites) and sent off a copy or two of my resume. Now that I have it, it's a great improvement in my life. 

I'm a big believer that we can have a world where wage labor is a thing of the past, but for now worker power is a way to protect ourselves from the worst of it. I also believe that if we do move to a world beyond work it will be the workers who make it happen and not the bosses. So, what better way to prepare and bring about that world than to join with other workers and organize?",False,od6kdf,anxietyraccoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/od6kdf/advice_for_those_who_want_to_escape_oppressive/,0,1
4077,"Covid19 ruined my Master's which was the last of my freedom, and now all I have left is a lifetime of wage slavery and no one understands why I hate it so much and am so depressed.","I feel like you guys will understand and need to vent somewhere…..

I am doing my Master’s on a scholarship and it got RUINED by Covid. 

I know I am still “getting my education”, but the truth is that I never really wanted to do this degree in the first place. It was something that was necessary for career prospects. 

But at least it was meant to be an overall experience. I was going to get to make friends in my classes, there was a study trip to Italy I saved money in anticipation of doing on, my campus is really beautiful and I looked forward to spending time on it, and I looked forward to treating myself to a graduation trip to South America when I was finished. I also wanted to have a nice graduation photoshoot.

Three weeks into my degree, everything went to shit and I’ve been online schooling ever since. Next semester is my last semester and it will be online too. I didn’t get any of that because of Covid. And I couldn’t postpone my scholarship, so I just had to suck it up. I had to move back home away from all my friends. I fucking hate my hometown. I’m 26 and everyone I know my age already has a couple of kids. The only way to make friends here is to go to church, and I’m bisexual atheist. 

I feel like I got all of the work of the degree - all the essays and shit, but absolutely none of the rewards. I didn’t get to make friends. I didn’t get to spend much time on campus. I’ll probably get a scaled down graduation, if I get one at all. I didn’t get to go abroad. All I got was shitty online lectures and more work. Since they can’t do exams, they make us write an extra paper every semester, and I’d rather just do an exam and be done. Since we can’t discuss things in class, we had to hand in 500 word reading summaries every class, every week, which again, is way more work than if things were normal. 

I’ve hated every second of it. 

I got offered a really great graduate job which starts 3 months after graduation. 

Everyone is acting like I won the lottery by getting this job. I get it. I am ""lucky"". I got a good job in a pandemic economy.

But I’m basically going from shitty online school into working the 9-5 grind until I die. 

I wanted that big graduation trip as a “last thing” with my freedom. I will never again have 10 weeks of freedom to do whatever I want without having to beg a boss for time off, without having to pay rent while I’m gone. I have lost that forever. But I’m selfish if I say I’m upset about that because “people died”. Just because people died doesn’t mean life hasn’t been shit for people. I’ve been stuck in my family home with parents who don’t understand depression, and isolated from my friends, and my last bit of freedom before going into the wage slave grind has been stolen from me. I wanted that so bad. But now…..all I have to look forward to is wage slavery and it’s honestly making me wish I just got Covid and died. My life is fucking over when the wage slavery starts.",False,odbc3e,covidruinedmymasters,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/odbc3e/covid19_ruined_my_masters_which_was_the_last_of/,0,1

I work in fast food, very busy chain (look thru my history and you'll find it no problem). I often take orders outside in the heat, in 90+°F weather. I do it with a smile on my face and no complaints even when I inevitably get heatstroke. It... really sucks. A lot. 

Anyway. I've been feeling sick the past couple of days. Probably due to the heat tbh. I usually just barf in the bathroom, flush, and go back outside feeling slightly better.

Today I just couldn't do it. I couldn't. I felt sick, I felt like a ball of crap, and I could not make myself get up and put on my uniform. I called off work, they're gonna give me a write up. And I feel so damn guilty about it. I know they're struggling without me, but I physically can't come in. I just sorta want to call and tell them in sorry but it's not gonna help them. I tried to get someone else to cover but we're super short-staffed due to a bunch of people quitting and getting fired in about a 2 month timespan.

I mean it's in our nature, right? to prefer peace over warfare, long-term happiness over short-term pleasure, shocking beneficial knowledge over intended harmful ignorance, and life over death. I mean I don't know about the rest of you, but isn't it became so obvious now that we are all in the same boat. We are all heading either towards global paradise or global hell. All the big picture analyses of our current situation don't seem optimistic at all, as our destiny is in hands of big capitalists and governors. Do they really give a shit about us? Even if they do and tried to solve the small little problems that bother us from the triviality of everyday life, Does anyone of them really have a clear agenda about the ecological, nuclear, political, social or technological challenges for the upcoming 10 or 20 years that cares really about all humans, not just his family or his party or nation and screw the rest? I don't think that any one of them will ever have one, and we need to do it by ourselves. We need to plan our future, find solutions to our problems, and determine our own destiny as we wish. 

I know I'll be clichéd and so predictable if I said we need a true revolution. Actually, I don't know.

She works as a full time pediatric nutritionist in a hospital, teaches a nutrition college course online during spring, a part time waitress and part time at a nursing home where she helps keep track of the nutrition of the elderly. So, yeah, she does a lot.

So, you see? Two of those jobs are ESSENTIAL. Both nutritionist jobs save lives.   The stories I have heard from her profession are so sad. The kids she treats, the babies she treats, some of them are born with birth defects, some have eating disorders, others have little to no muscle mass. She works hard with her team to keep those kids healthy.

And guess what? SHE STILL HAS TO WORK THREE EXTRA JOBS!!! Why??? She does so much for other people only to be rewarded with being broke, living paycheck to paycheck. Does anybody else see what’s wrong with that? 

A few years ago when she was given the opportunity to teach the online college course for like 4K she immediately said yes. Why? We are broke as fuck. That 4K pays for rent for 2 months. Yep. Our rent is 2K.

The best jobs I’ve had it the past, my coworkers and bosses had outdated or lightly used profiles because the management was decent and there wasn’t a reason to always be looking at the door.

A tactic I’ve used in the past to gauge workplace morale is to type in the name of the company and the department I’m applying for into LinkedIn - and if the results light up like a golden Christmas tree with the LI Premium badges, I know the workplace is generally trash.

But, if you live almost anywhere that’s not THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, you PROBABLY don’t even have internet access, at least not unrestricted access that allows you to connect to Reddit.

OK, first off! So you’re lucky enough to have been born in THE GREATEST AND MOST FREEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD????? CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!! You’ve already accomplished your LITERAL FIRST SUCCESS!!!!!! GOOD JOB!!!!!!!!

Of course, you didn’t REALLY choose to be born here, your parents did, so THANK THEM for giving you the GREATEST GIFT OF ALL, THE GIFT OF LIFE!!!!!!!! Can you imagine if your parents didn’t even allow you the opportunity to BE BORN?????? You’d be missing out on the opportunity of the POSSIBILITY of experiencing DELAYED GRATIFICATION, getting to RETIRE near the END of your life, after 40-50+ years of HARD WORK, you get to (MAYBE) enjoy TRUE FREEDOM, in your LAST FEW FINAL YEARS, AMAZING! That’s the goal in life, the AMERICAN DREAM!!!!!!

But wait! There’s more! The American Dream also allows you the opportunity to have the GRAND AND SACRED HONOR, of helping our nations 1% to GROW THEIR WEALTH EVEN MORE!!!!!! 

You can spend as little as just 40 HOURS A WEEK contributing to your generous leaders who allowed you the opportunity to be a part of something bigger than yourself!!!!!!!

If you and your leaders aren’t seeing eye to eye? That’s OK! Our TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED CITY STREETS offer COMPETITIVE and INDUSTRIAL LEADING AMENITIES that our BETTER THAN EVER (compared to previous times in history).

You can rely on the GENEROUS and CHARITABLE donations of people who are willing to help you out, knowing that you’re not BURDENING the people who don’t want to help you, so you can sleep better at night (under that luxurious bridge or in those fantastical woods!)

Your teens, 20s, 30s, EVEN 40s, are JUST THE BEGINNING OF YOUR EXCITING AND ADVENTUROUS JOURNEY!!!!!!! So if you haven’t achieved certain experiences yet, THAT’S OK, you have MANY, MANY PROMISING years ahead of you!!!(Promising does not necessarily mean an actual promise, ironic isn’t it?)

Best of all, you can create YOUR VERY OWN CHILD! You can continue this GREAT CYCLE, and who knows? Maybe your child will be the one to fix this mess? If not, that’s OK! You’re still allowing another child to experience this already (better than past history and modern day third world countries) AMAZING EXPERIENCE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE A GREATER PURPOSE!!!!!!

This offer won’t last forever though! If you wait TOO LONG (until your 30s-40s) you may LOSE THIS AMAZING DEAL of giving another life their own chance at these AMAZING opportunities. 

What’s that? Can’t find a partner to partake in this exciting endeavor with? Just focus on serving your GENEROUS LEADERS!!!!! They’ll give your life PURPOSE AND MEANING!!!!!! 

Your glorious leaders can even offer you HEALTH INSURANCE to access affordable drugs! You can drown your romantic, sexual, even your desires for HOBBIES with this FANTASTIC MAGICAL DRUGS!!!!!!!! Pair this with serving your wonderful leaders, and you’re GOLDEN.

No need to OWN your own home, you can RENT, and contribute to even MORE GENEROUS LEADERS!!!!!!!! How kind of them to offer you the LUXURY of having shelter, if the streets aren’t to your liking.  

Want to become a leader yourself? A leader OF yourself? WHOAH THERE! Slow down! You can’t go jeopardizing THE BIG DOGS, who have been SO GENEROUS, as to allow you all of these amazing opportunities in the first place! You’ll first need to get permission, then you’re GOOD TO GO!!!!! But make sure you’re not TOO SUCCESSFUL, not if it hurts them, they did allow you the opportunity after all.

This may all sound so overwhelming, but don’t worry. One day, maybe even sooner than later, all of your experiences WILL expire, FOREVER. It won’t be free, but we’ll simply pass the expenses of your expiration onto your next of kin! It won’t be cheap, but you won’t be paying for it!

No next of kin? GoFundMe is here to save the day! GoFuckYourself for not planning for your own death though, you’ve been awarded all of these amazing opportunities and didn’t take advantage of them to ease the burden of our great leaders-

I mean, ENJOY!!!!!!!

4166,The ability to walk away is your greatest power,"My wife has been struggling in a job for a year and a half. By struggling I don’t mean with the job itself, but the politics and stress of it all. She does excellent work, and I’ve told her she should ask for a raise or demand to be treated better (her boss is a narc and saps every ounce of value out of her so she can take the credit when she presents the work to her bosses).

I have known that my wife is being underutilized and undervalued and underpaid. The problem is, I didn’t have a job, so her job alone supported me and our two kids.

Fast forward to this last week when I started a new job at $85k/yr after spending last year to finish school, more than my family has ever dreamed of making (she’s been making $53k, and before the pandemic we were living off my income of $19/hr). One week in and she decides she doesn’t want to work anymore because she’s pregnant and the stress of figuring out childcare for two kids with two FT WFH parents is just not worth the money.

Oh boy, her boss, a boss from a different department, her boss’ boss, and the dean of the college (she works at a community college) are all groveling at her feet to stay, asking if she can work part time for them, even just doing some curriculum development so she stays in the system. They are telling her to take a little leave of absence to clear her head and come back, offering all kinds of incentives to retain her. Turns out she had ALL kinds of negotiating power that she left on the table this year just because she felt she couldn’t walk away. Now she’s walking away no matter what they offer her and there’s nothing they can do about it.

The anxiety likes to pop up the day before I go back to work, but not nearly as bad. This is a struggle I have had since I started working maybe 8 or so years ago. I limit myself to part-time work because of it. I want to just quit my job, as I always feel happiest when I am just at home with family and not at work. But the realist in me knows that is not practical, as I need to pay my way like anyone else and not mooch or depend on others. And I certainly don't want to feel like a failure.

4181,"Dear Human,","Have anyone thought about the idea of a united world that all humans live in a harmony and all pursuing their overall well-being? Is it so hard to ask? I mean it's in our nature, right? to prefer peace over warfare, long-term happiness over short-term pleasure, shocking beneficial knowledge over intended harmful ignorance, and life over death. I mean I don't know about the rest of you, but isn't it became so obvious now that we are all in the same boat. We are all heading either towards global paradise or global hell. All the big picture analyses of our current situation don't seem optimistic at all, as our destiny is in hands of big capitalists and governors. Do they really give a shit about us? Even if they do and tried to solve the small little problems that bother us from the triviality of everyday life, Does anyone of them really have a clear agenda about the ecological, nuclear, political, social or technological challenges for the upcoming 10 or 20 years that cares really about all humans, not just his family or his party or nation and screw the rest? I don't think that any one of them will ever have one, and we need to do it by ourselves. We need to plan our future, find solutions to our problems, and determine our own destiny as we wish. 

I know I'll be clichéd and so predictable if I said we need a true revolution. Actually, I don't know. I am no one, who just knows we are in a fucked up world that needs to truly change, and we have the power to do so together. I am not asking for a mass rebellion, demonstrations or boycotts. I don't have all answers, and no one does. I just think that we have common problems, and in our advantage all to solve them, and we figure out the best answers and do our best in a social setting, so why not work together; united? Can't we all forget our biases, prejudices and titles that separate us apart, and seek the supreme good instead? I am not an activist, influencer, businessman, university professor, economist, or philosopher. As I said I am no one, but a human and the only thing that concerns me is my well-being which includes others' well-being.  I said what I truly meant, and those are my words, which I assure you no one behind them but me. I don't know if my words would move a finger, and I don't know if anyone feels the same, but I hope so. I have this dream and I think we all have it; we all seek our well-being. We need to take an action now before it's too late and all of us get enslaved. If you have the same dream and want to make it real, please share your ideas with us, and for fuck's sake we are in the 21st century we are all now one connected human civilization.

I've been working hard for 25 years, am finally debt-free, and have decided it's time to take a break from full-time paid labor for a few years and rediscover the joy of just being alive in the world.

(And cooking; I never had the time or energy before.)

I've minimal needs/expenses and enough savings to carry me safely for a few years, but without work-based health insurance, I'm not sure what to do.  If I got paid coverage through my state's ACA exchange (Colorado), I'd deplete years of savings in a matter of months--even the cheap plans aren't cheap.

I guess there's state medicaid, but I have no idea if it would cover someone in my situation.

An option is simply forgoing medical care entirely.  I'm desperate enough for a break that I would consider this, but only as a last resort.

4205,"I need to vent, you guys are the only ones who understand…","I almost got a job after a couple months of being unemployed. I’m just coasting on part time whatever jobs as I’m tired of the trade I went to school for, and have no more ambition to go back to school. 

So this pub wants to “give me a chance” and I have never waited on tables before. It’s still entry level so it can’t be that bad, and they look at me like there’s no way I could possibly be able to do this job with no experience, like fuck off, I’m not an idiot. Anyway, they said they’d try me out, and train me and not set me up to fail, which is exactly what they did in the end. 

I had 3 five hour training shifts that were a week apart, then they throw me into it by myself on the 4th shift. They ended up sending me home because I didn’t do well enough, but I still needed help, and they just blame me because they don’t want to train anyone. I’m so sick of lazy employers who expect you to break your back for them. 

The place claimed to be equal opportunity and I thought they’d be understanding of my ptsd/anxiety. I was overwhelmed, getting drinks and people’s bills mixed up, cus I need more training, and the 2 people I worked with just let me fail and said I should just leave instead of fixing my mistakes once I came back from crying in the bathroom and catching my breath. I wasn’t doing that bad, the girl I think was jealous of me cus she’s trailer trash and wanted a reason to make me leave. One of her regulars commented on how pretty I was without a mask and she like stopped talking to me after that. Sounds petty but I get this from bitches a lot. 

I’m so angry because I do need a job, and it’s not as easy as it should be to get an entry level job. The owner had the audacity to tell me his servers make “good money” on min wage + tips, after I’m used to seeing flat rate hours in a body shop, like 200 hours in a pay check, and I laughed at him. 

The way I deal with jobs now is I see it like I’m giving my time to help them run their business, I’m not here to be made a spectacle of or picked on for being new. I’m 32, not a teenager, let me do my job and fuck off, you want me to be happy about it? That’ll cost extra. Im so done letting the employer act as if he’s doing me a favour by letting me work, you’re lucky I even show up for the shit pay I get. 

He accused me of sounding like I didn’t want to be there when I set boundaries like you do in an abusive relationship, and they don’t like it. Treat every job like you’re dating and watch what happens when you actually set healthy boundaries. They didn’t like when I asked how long my first shift was going to be, “why do you got somewhere else to be?” Bitch yah I’d rather be anywhere but here and none of your business.

I am now on 2 blood pressure medications, to stabilize my blood pressure and lower my heart rate. 

I have a crippling amount of anxiety it is so bad I can barely function. I am now getting depressed which I’ve never suffered from depression prior. I am also starting to be short with loved ones, I’m getting very angry/aggressive and unsympathetic towards others. 

I also possibly have an inflammatory bowel disease—currently awaiting results. But so far the doctor is pretty positive. 

I have always always dealt with these symptoms but now everything is severe especially my anxiety. 

I look horrible my appearance has definitely took a toll. Most days I don’t even run a comb through my hair. I do enough to get by as high functioning.

I haven’t even gotten really into my role yet which terrifies me. 

I literally live for the weekends. I can’t imagine doing this forever or even another day. 

I also am making $30-40K below what PM’s make in my area and with the cost of living, I almost feel like I’m living only slightly better than I was as a college student.",False,obwrcw,wishfulhope77,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/obwrcw/being_a_project_manager_is_ruining_me/,8,1

I was unemployed for years and on disability and life was stress free. Pretty boring but I’d take that over stress. I wish sometimes I could go back to those days. I’m in a relationship, a mortgage and wedding on the horizon. This is all pretty great but I kinda have a nihilist view of things. Like what’s the point? Weddings are damn expensive and mortgage won’t be paid off until I’m old and grey. I’ll never be able to retire so I can’t even look forward to that.

4228,I've traced pretty much all of society's issues back to employers.,"There are fewer and fewer jobs that people can honestly say ""they are proud to work for this company"".

I am not 30 yet and notice the amount of service I receive is not the same, the service my parents used to get was better.

There has been a shift, starting sometime in the 80's or 90's, where companies went from being for the customer, to being for the shareholder.

Companies have grown so massive, merged so many times, that they literally don't give a shit if you call saying you are leaving them. For some people, that may not even be possible anymore. 

Workers have pretty much been turned into biological robots. Everything is on a count down now.

I worked at a call center for a year, and the BIGGEST reason for people getting mad is not having enough time to help them. You see, we had an ""average handle time"", which means if I took an hour to genuine solve a complex issue, I would then have to rush on the next 10 calls. 

Companies do not care about the customers anymore, few do, it's bottom line or bust. They pay people so little turnover is massive, which also makes people pissed because stuff you learn over time vanishes when someone who has been with a company 10 years quits.

I remember going into Radio Shack or Sears as a kid in the 90s and the people there KNEW THEIR SHIT. Now turnover at any place like this is so high, it's hard to even ask someone what isle something is in, because they genuinely don't know. Go into Home Depot and ask someone in electrical an electrical question, or someone in plumbing a plumbing question, and they have no clue. They haven't even been there long enough to know what half the shit even does. 

People just seem so angry anymore, so flighty, so quick to fight. Always rushing, always in a hurry. 

I think a lot of it is psychological, you spend 8-12 hours a day at your job rushing to get everything done on time, naturally it rubs off on anything that goes on beyond work.

People didn't have to rush back then. Watch a video of a car or some other type of factory in the 1950's and watch the same factories today, people took their time, they didn't have to do everything 100 miles an hour, which also causes more mistakes. 

This rushing, how you are treated on the job, etc causes STRESS. You naturally vent your frustrations, taking it out on friends, your partners, or drinking or smoking to take the edge off. 

It is also why the US has some of the highest rates of depression on the planet, or why people just lose their shit one day and go out and mow down a school with a gun or blow shit up. 

I can say with absolute certainty that the cause of 95% of stress, depression, anger, suicide, etc is a direct or indirect byproduct of a person's work environment, the impacts they have on the customers, on the people in their life, etc.",False,oc0b72,_Raspootin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oc0b72/ive_traced_pretty_much_all_of_societys_issues/,7,1
4229,"When I was a kid, my father always said to me ""When you have a job, even if you hate it, you always go. You never call out. You never quit. You just go no matter what.""","Needless to say that I never took this advice, but what a shitty thing to instill in a child. 

My father was a shitty, abusive alcoholic and I know that his bullshit job exacerbated his alcoholism. He hated his job and instead of trying to go something to change it, he just suffered.

He was depressed as shit so he would just get shit faced every night, treat me and my mom like shit, pass out and do it all over again the next day. Once I got older and I put two and two together, I knew that what he was pushing on me was just bullshit. 

If I hated a job, I'd stick it out, but I'd eventually quit. The older I got, the faster I went through jobs once things got shitty. 

I'm finally doing something I like to do and have been working towards it for an entire year. While I'm happy that I'm no longer chained behind a desk, I still don't know if I can do this shit for the next 30 years, and if I can't? Guess what?

4276,Need to get this off my chest,"So I'm 18, finished high school last year and am now doing a course in film and television which is pretty full on (5 days a week, around 25 hours) 

I've had two jobs this year. One at a pharmacy and one at a cafe

I actually quite liked the job at pharmacy, it was walking distance from my house, the hours were super flexible to fit my schedule and it was very slow stress. Too bad that after about only a month of me working there, they stopped giving me any shifts. I went into the store to ask if there were any upcoming shifts but they said there weren't any available, so that was the end of that. 

About a month later I got a job at a cafe. The shifts were not the best times (early mornings before class) and it was faster pace, making it more stressful. Nonetheless I still was content with it, as it was giving me an income at the end of the day. Then about only two weeks later my state went into a lockdown and the cafe closed for that period. When lockdown ended I contacted them asking when my next shift would be. I got a reply back saying that they found someone else to take over my role. So that was that.

\~

So basically, I'm writing this post after just having an argument with my dad about work. My dad was going on about how shy and closed off I am and that that's the reason I've been losing all this work.

And you know what, as much as I hate to say it, he's probably right. 

I would consider myself an introvert so it takes me a while to open up to people. So in a retail / hospitality setting, I'm not going to be the bubbliest and most outgoing person to a customer, and it's not that I'm trying to be rude, it's just kinda how I am for now.

I've been looking for more work but I'm so sick of it all, the applications, the trial shifts, the rejections, it really get's to me. 

Well, that's my rant over. Not really sure what else to say expect that the thought of work now just makes me so drained and sad, and I really, really wish I didn’t have to get a shitty minimum wage job to pay off my education.",False,obl78o,Issy14,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/obl78o/need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,7,1

4283,"Is Self-Monetization the Key to Financial Freedom and ""Anti-Work""?","I'm new to this sub, and am not sure how to phrase the above question adequately so bear with me.

I was thinking about this idea a few months ago and when this sub was suggested to me, it got the wheels turning again. I don't know a ton about the future of the internet and technology, but I'm curious to know if anyone here has researched or analyzed it.

More and more people are making incomes through online businesses, many of whom are not necessarily monetizing their passions, hobbies, or talents, but monetizing themselves. I don't know for sure, but I think it's safe to assume that earning insane 6 and 7-figure incomes in a year as content creators on platforms like YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, OnlyFans, Patreon, or other monetizable platforms is not the norm for most people. That being said, it seems like over time more people have been able to make a living that supports themselves and their lifestyles as creators and influencers online.

People shit on Google and YouTube consistently over their crappy practices, regulations, and penalties against creators, but the reality is, YouTube isn't going anywhere and more and more people are joining the platform and gaining substantial enough followings to make a living off of the platform's monetization program and sponsored, branded content. ""Influencers"" sharing branded content exists on most if not all social media platforms. 

YouTube is only one example--you can replace it with any other relevant social media platforms used by millions to billions of people. If every adult in the US (again, just as an example--or say, rather, every adult in the world), created a channel/account and posted content specific to them, but of reasonable quality and of general interest, would it be financially and technologically possible for everyone to subscribe to/follow one another, watch through a variety of content regularly to boost others' views, and the creator can make a living off of their earnings? Advertising on social media seems to keep shifting more towards dedicated branded content from creators and sponsorships embedded in-video/content. Brands are not going to stop using influencers anytime soon and more and more DTC retailers are born online everyday. Influencer marketing obviously works, so would it be in brands' and companies' best interest to treat each person online as a salesperson? Or would over-saturation/population occur on each platform and negate the effectiveness of social media monetization and influencer marketing? Would it render content creation useless?

Essentially, I'm just curious to know if anyone thinks it could be possible for the internet to turn into a human marketplace where people solely support themselves by selling their lives(/souls) online.",False,obtj63,emboheme,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/obtj63/is_selfmonetization_the_key_to_financial_freedom/,2,1

So a week later I asked for a raise and he goes “well, you’re still pretty fresh but maybe after your two year mark we can discuss again. I know you’re at an entry level rate and I’ve been there too but I’ve never given anyone a raise and I’m not sure how the equation works with senior leadership.”

I mentioned my apartment lease is expiring sooner than that and I’m not sure what my budget should be, but that I’d like to live closer to work (since they are forcing us to go to a hybrid model even though my job can be done remotely). Admittedly this wasn’t the best response but I’ve been very stressed out by my living situation and he’s always asking me personal questions and what he can do to keep me happy, so I thought it was a relevant point to bring up.

He interrupts me and says “with me it’s ok but as a piece of career advice, you shouldn’t use ‘I want to spend more money, so give me more money’ as a tactic in any business transaction. It’s not relevant because the higher ups can just tell you to go live outside the city”

The rest of the meeting was pretty uncomfortable because I was so annoyed he would try to gaslight me like that. Obviously it wasn’t meant to be a tactic so much as a very stressful reality of living and working in such a high cost of living area. 

So now I’m stuck in limbo while I wait to see if he’ll vouch for me or not. But honestly, that interaction just made me lose a lot of respect for him and I don’t even want the raise anymore. I just want out✌🏼

4294,How I went from depression to bliss and how you can too!," 

Yes, Corona has in some way hit us all hard. what is the worst part of this pandemic, isn’t the illness itself, but the fact that it has pushed millions upon millions of people out of their livelihoods and into states of DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY

A huge percentage of the adult population in America have started seeing life coaches and therapists to find some way out of the mess that their lives are in.

But here is the problem, life coaches and therapists charge exorbitant amounts of money. Not everyone can afford to churn out 1000s of dollars every month to take care of their mental health.

Another problem with these life coaches and therapists is that they don’t provide solid solutions to actually lift people out of depression and bring them into a state of joy. Almost every session is filled with a higher percentage of solace than a tenable solution.

As a person who has struggled with depression myself, and gone to all these coaches I can attest to the fact that I haven’t found a solution from them for my issues.

But after a lot of self-introspection and pouring over book after book for months together I built an actionable plan for 40 days to implement in my life to come out of depression completely.

I followed it religiously and voila, after 40 days depression felt like a distant, far away dream. I can say for sure that, now I am bubbling with joy and bliss, and every day is a celebration 😊

I feel it is my moral duty to share it with as many people as I possibly can! And I also feel it is my moral responsibility to not charge the kind of money that life coaches charge for their sessions.

So I have now been offering sessions to thousand and thousands of people who are struggling with their lives for a very very nominal fee.

I can afford to charge a nominal fee for it, as I am not reliant on this for my source of income. I charge only to cover the time and energy I spend on this. I have various successful businesses and I have been blessed with abundance in the financial level.

What really touches me isn’t the money, but the fact that in some way I can help people who are need of help. When people come back to you a few days after the session, and say what you told me transformed my life, that is the greatest fulfillment I feel I can achieve in my life!

4298,This Is What Would Happen If The Top 25 Richest Americans Gave Away 3% of Their Wealth,"Feel free to check my math here, but this is what I came up with.

The combined wealth of the top 25 richest Americans, as per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Americans_by_net_worth), is $1,629,300,000,000.

Now, I realize not all of that wealth is totally liquid, but surely some of it is. Assuming that each of those people gave away just 3% of their money, the combined total would be $48,879,000,000.

&amp;#x200B;

* Meanwhile, the total cost to [end homelessness in the United States](https://www.globalgiving.org/learn/how-much-would-it-cost-to-end-homelessness-in-america/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Department%20of,homelessness%20in%20the%20United%20States) is estimated to be around $20,000,000,000.
* The total cost to [achieve global literacy](https://gemreportunesco.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/how-much-does-it-cost-to-achieve-universal-literacy/#:~:text=As%20events%20for%20International%20Literacy,the%20largest%20population%20in%20the) is estimated to be around $14,000,000,000.
* The total cost to [build 100 brand new hospitals](https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-hospital) is estimated to be around $11,250,000,000, assuming that the average hospital costs $112,500,000 to build.

…as such, the total of all of that is $45,250,000,000.

$48,879,000,000 (3% of the top 25's wealth) minus $45,250,000,000 (cost of all the above) = $3,629,000,000 left over.

$3,629,000,000 ÷ 25 people = $145,160,000 back to each person.

…

…

So, essentially, if each of the 25 richest Americans (to say nothing of the other billionaires in this country, of which there are 600+) ***alone*** donated just 3% of their money, they could end homelessness in America, achieve global literacy, and build *100 brand new hospitals* across the United States. They would also each get back nearly $150 million dollars, which is far more than any one person could conceivably spend in an entire lifetime.

This would not even affect their wealth all that much — for example, Warren Buffet would go from a net worth of $87,500,000,000 to $84,875,000,000. Mark Zuckerberg would go from $105,000,000,000 to $101,850,000,000.

Woke up feeling particularly gloomy thinking about the prospect of a better life -- mine's really not bad relative to others -- and it just blows me away that nothing has really indicated that anything is going to change any time soon.


I'll admit I haven't done a ton a of research on the topic, so I have no idea what industries would be best, which geographical locations, etc., but it's not hard to see that any significant loss in just one area would cripple many others via the ""butterfly effect"". We've seen real world examples in a very short term here with Covid-19, followed by the environmental disasters in and around Texas. I have to imagine that entire industries were barely hanging on by a thread, made apparent by the supply shortages that can't even be properly forecasted to this day. The astonishing part is that, while these natural disasters definitely could have been planned and prepared for much better (quality infrastructure, more social safety nets), at the end of the day they were sorta out of our control. If there was a concerted effort put together, a general strike, the effects and duration would be placed directly in the hands of the people, it could literally halt everything until demands were met. I've seen loose theories that just 30-40% of the work force ceasing operations (general strike) would be sufficient enough to make a HUGE and detrimental negative impact on the economy overall, which would be GOOD for us in the long run.


I'm fully aware that there are would be a huge variance on impacts on the people during this period, some are in much worse positions as others, and it would absolutely be scary. Organized mutual aid would be put to it's test here, and like I said I'm nowhere near having complete logistics figured out.


Another thing that would need to be considered is ensuring that everybody held strong and resilient throughout the designated time. At some point after things really kicked off, leadership could be inherited by trustworthy, non-profit driven organizations. IWW (and other respectable unions) could take the brunt of this, and other closely scrutinized grass roots political groups could fill in as needed; again logistics required, I'm just a simple stupid worker.

&amp;nbsp;

As I said before, it astonishes me that overall sentiment hasn't really changed, especially in regards to recent events over the past couple years. Sure there are loads of people posting online, *cough cough*, but on a real world day-to-day basis I feel like everyone I come across is either happy that things are ""returning to normal"" (they're not, and ""normal"" was, at best, not great for the common populace), or waiting for things to ""return to normal"". What is it going to take for Americans to realize how fucked things are? Covid, natural disasters destroying necessary infrastructure, clear and evident tampering of the market (more clear and evident than before), what looks like another housing bubble coming up, people being booted from their homes during the pandemic, new record temperatures every year, the list goes on and on just for recent things. I hate to be a doomer, but it feels like we're all going to be burnt up or some of us will be living in Mad Max world before a significant amount of people realize that change is necessary, even though we're already way past that point. The entire world is greatly suffering and I'm constantly filled with dread.",False,obv0c7,ThatZBear,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/obv0c7/its_insane_that_so_much_could_be_changed_in_the/,1,1
4302,I am so fucking sick of interviewers wasting my time.,"I am not a school -&gt; uni -&gt; job kind of person. I have a very varied CV and have done lots of different stuff. I've also been active outside of work and have some shit to offer there that looks pretty decent in a CV (taught some stuff, been politically active). 

Since my original occupation was fun, but abysmally paid and didn't offer any chance of career advancement or even a steady job (It was in science, so only ever project-related 12-month contracts), I've decided to switch at age 34. Now I'm back at uni pursuing a degree in a diferent field, a plan that was thoroughly fucked by the advent of covid and my daughters daycare being perpetually closed during the past 18 or so months. So now I'm switching my studies to part-time, and looking for jobs again.


And boy, does this suck. Literally *all* my applications end in me being invited for an interview. Sounds good? Well it isn't. It took me some time to understand that, but I'm not really being invited as a prospective employee - Nope, I'm being invited as a curiousity, because HR people are a bunch of voyeuristic fucks.

The last position I interviewed for was low-level IT support. I'm plenty qualified for that, I have the communicational skills which they claimed were so important, during the interview I quickly build immense rapport with all three of the interviewers, I gave answers that they seemed very much satisfied with. And answers I did give, because these fuckers asked about *everything*. Fucking everything. Ridiculous hypotheticals that had no relation whatsoever to the job: ""If I asked you to draft an IT-Emergency plan, how would you proceed?"" Well, I'm interviewing for a no-skill part-time student job that pays 11 fucking euro an hour, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A TASK I'M GONNA BE CONFRONTED WITH ANYTIME SOON. Nor will I ever be faced with the decision on what technology to use if this multi-billion-dollar company conglomerate would completely revamp their homepage, thank you very much, but of course I'll gladly answer these bullshit questions from my *oh-so-interesting and unusual perspective*, reap some beaming smiles and satisfied nods, and then they go on and give the fucking job to some clueless fucking 20-year-old bachelor student.

I get invited as entertainment. They see my CV and they want to ask some prying questions, satisfy their curiosity, and then send me on my merry way, having wasted several hours of my time in preperation, organizing childcare, and the interview itself. At least nowadays the shit is only, so I don't waste travel expenses on top of all that.

4320,LPT: Get a security job if you hate working. They are usually super easy and you can find a good paying one if you are fortunate.,"Recently found a job that has been my favorite job ever so far. I do patient transport at a hospital, and I basically pick patients up and I drive them to whatever local hospital they need to be moved to. 

This job pays pretty good for my area ($16.00 an hour) and we are contracted through the local police department.

There is no bullshit busy work. No working as a slave. I literally sit around 95 percent of the time doing nothing. I sit in an office and just browse my phone all day long. I just wait for a call. If there is no calls for the day, we just sit around and collect 16 an hour for doing nothing. 


I have worked shitty physical jobs. Jobs that are super fast paced and breaks are hard to come by. Jobs that pay shit... Honestly, I lucked out with this job, but seriously look into a security job if you absolutely hate the concept of working. Stay away from hospital security guard jobs (unless if it is something separate like patient transport), and you should be good to go. Vast majority of security jobs at private companies are just bullshitting and standing around. It can be boring, but it is some of the easiest money you can get. And as someone like me, it is the perfect job I absolutely hate a ""traditional"" job. If you want to maximize your time, at a security job you have a lot of free time at, it is a great opportunity to catch up on classwork if you are in school. If you wanted to work online through something like Lionsbridge, you could do that in your free time at your security job and essentially double your hourly wage. I can pull $30.00 an hour with doing Lionsbridge in my free time, and collecting a free 16 and hour from my patient transport job...Just throwing a tip out there, that I finally realized.",False,oby17q,NextMention10,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/oby17q/lpt_get_a_security_job_if_you_hate_working_they/,29,1

My supervisor and I have been going back and forth. I do my job, she messages me randomly throughout the day, nitpicking. Sometimes she gets word I did something wrong, and she gleefully interrupts me to let me know that 1 person didn't like the way I spoke to them on the phone, or that my timer says I was off the phone for a minute too long...I hear about that stuff instantly. 

Now, if a customer sends her a compliment email about me? She gets them, I get CC'd, and then they disappear. They're supposed to be published to her boss, and my team, but they are not.

The worst thing she did this week was call me an hour before my shift started. Somehow she thought I was working a different shift, and thought I was an hour late to work, and was yelling at me... And I said simply: ""I start in 10 minutes. Are you OK?""

She said ""Oh. No. We're good."" and hung up.

No apology about that...

Today was my employee review. It was supposed to be tomorrow, but they surprised changed it at 7 AM today to take place on my lunchtime TODAY... OK...

I knew it was going to be ugly. They made it a 30 minute meeting instead of the usually 15... 

I joined... She was 5 minutes late... 

She immediately opened up on me about overstepping my job duties, making other departments look bad. After this, she said ""Let's see what your numbers are,"" with a tone that she wanted me to fail. 

She made me open my reviews in front of her and share my screen with her... 

And you could hear a pin drop as each review showed 100%, or 90%, or a customer saying how much I helped them, or the best part, when my 2 week ranking was #2 out of all employees... My supervisor, looking to find *SOME* way to fuck me, made me switch it to show 4 weeks of data... More data, more room to fuck up, right?

I went to #1. Absolute SILENCE from them.

And you know what? I'm not bragging. I actually hate this. I know I do good labor, and really help people, and all their feedback is 9 or 10 out of 10... 

[My lowest rating was someone ranting about how I did a wonderful job, but the team above me didn't follow up even after I talked to their supervisor to help the client... The client gave that one a low rating but they said it was because that team failed, not me. They praised me for a paragraph!](https://i.imgur.com/5TSejlh.png)

She had no words.

So, I'm doing OK. More than OK. But, due to the systems at work, I get hate from my supervisor for not following the policy of just reading scripts and sending tickets off. They want people to be robots and get those stats in, make that line go up. 

My labor could be put to doing stuff *I want to do*. I have tried doing just what I am supposed to do, and it just leads to an excruciating boredom. I love solving problems.

4348,Why it's socially unacceptable for teenagers to have a summer break?,"I recently graduated high school. In October I am moving to a larger city to study at university. It's important to note that studying as itself is free in my contry. Of course you have to pay for things like housing, food, clothes etc. so I plan to pick some additional job when I will be there. Nothing ambitious, just enough to survive. 

But right know I have a summer break. I read books, play with my band, do some voluntary work, travel with serious politicians to get friends I will one day - hopefully - work with, and learn about things that interest me the most. However, my mother constantly makes fights about me not making money. I asked her if the wants me to share the bills with them for the next months, but the declined and said it would be good for me to have some money for my own things. I do - it's not much but I make enough playing with band on some local events to have money for books, cinema tickets and clothes - and that's all I need right now.

My mom then talks about her friend's 16-years old son who works at factory to buy himself a motorcycle. But I don't need a motorcycle, or new PlayStation, or driver licence (I can always pick a train, not everyone has to have their own car, climate has already been damaged enough). I don't want to posses all these things, I want to spend my time the way I want to grow as a person on other levels!

However, not only my mother, but the rest of the family, friends, teachers, neighbors see me as some lazy parasite for not wanting to bust my social status with different possessions. The life is too short to spend it working for things you don't need to have. My mother is a teacher, she is now also having a break. She wants me to have ""a real work that makes actual money"" not because we need it but because society expects young people like me to work during summer. That's why all these people get angry at me. Because I don't want to fit the system - the system that is being controlled by rich and based on exploitation of workers who need money to survive. I would much rather spend my free time to do something to change it than trying to fit it.",False,obkk3m,adam1210leg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/obkk3m/why_its_socially_unacceptable_for_teenagers_to/,17,1

Quit my last job a day before New Year, because I can't stand it anymore. Already suffered physically and mentally because of the pressure and something that triggered my past trauma, I went back and forth to clinic and even had a session with therapist. Not to mention that I had to endure until last day because there was a contractual penalty if I quit before my designed date.  


I want to rest, take a break after that six month of work at my previous job. Instead, my parents keep guilt-tripping me with my long employment gap. They keep pushing me by showing me job ads one after another, and when I show them I don't qualify because my experience and/or age don't meet requirement, they will accuse me for being pessimistic. Also, I already cancelled two interviews from different source, one is because it is really fishy to begin with, whereas the other one needs me to be willing to travel to different areas outside town, even though pandemic is still there and stuff.  


Pardon me for saying this, but while I hate this whole ongoing pandemic, I am actually kind of grateful because now I and my parent can't get out to eat at restaurant now that people are enforced to stay at home again, thus avoiding the so-called ""heart to heart talk"" when in reality, I feel like it's more of a judgment session and another dose of guilt-tripping.

4358,Small Businesses are just as bad as big ones,"Work in a cafe and they always called us a family and tbh, I felt like I was apart of one. Then the cracks started to show. I was zero hours but was only given an hour notice, asking me if I could work that day, despite them knowing that they wanted me in the night before. I started doing jobs that were not on the job description, I could never sleep at night because I didn't know whether I would be working the next day or not, and I was constantly getting told off because I couldn't perform 3 tasks in one go. It's been 2 months since I should have received my P60 and I still haven't got it, and to top it off, they told me I would no longer be getting paid furlough a day before they decided to stop it, despite having know months before hand.

I've been invited to an apprenticeship I really want to do and hope I get the job, but no way will I be going back or even working in hospitality ever again. I watched a woman die from a drug overdose outside the cafe and all the customers came in to tell me that it was her fault for taking drugs and she deserved to die.
