4,Financial Incentive,i hear capitalists say that people are lazy and won't work without a financial incentive all the time  first of all  i think that is a ridiculous worldview  people like working as long as they still have time to live their lives and it's meaningful work that actually improves their quality of life and contributes something to their community   but let's imagine it was true though and all people universally hated working  why on earth would we organize our world in this way if we believe that  how did it become  people hate work so we need to create an economic system that forces them to spend their entire lives doing it  and not  people hate to work so let's build a world that allows for as much leisure time as possible   this is our world people  we can manifest any reality we want  it's time for a major reset ,pyukh2

26,Manager attempted to give me criminal record,so i used to work at a chain restaurant  we weren t fancy - we did burgers  sandwiches  steak and fries  etc  i think the most fancy thing we ever did was a risotto during a spring two-for-one meal deal  the servers were expected to do everything  there were no bussers or designated hosts  and rather than it being the kitchen porter s job to polish and clean the cutlery it was ours instead  normally i wouldn t mind this  but it was always busy  and one manager in particular - let s call him kevin - would always be on our asses about how lazy we were   when i started  i was in recovery from an ed and pretty severe depression  i was feeling better and i needed money to propose to my girlfriend  so i got a part time job getting paid  6 56 an hour  which is the bare minimum wage for someone my age  i m an energetic guy  so i didn t mind all the running around  but the customers would regularly treat us like dog shit and the managers would never back us up  we had to fend for ourselves  there were so many unspoken rules  we weren t even allowed to slouch when we sat down for our break because it  looked unprofessional    my  part time  job quickly became three days per week doing eight or nine hours  and then it became three eight hour shifts and one twelve hour  and then two eight and two twelve  at no point was i offered a raise  we had to order food for our break meal that was under ten pounds  which meant that i was running around for eight or twelve hours with just a salad and a protein bar from home to sustain me   it started affecting me mentally  to the point where i had a terrible relapse  i decided to hand in my two weeks  and then shit went down   it s the middle of a busy saturday shift  i had just finished taking care of four or five tables start to finish with absolutely no assistance  i was also expected to train a new hire who  while he was sweet  was thick as pig shit  i got a new table who were rude and didn t speak good english  don t get me wrong  i am very patient with people trying to learn english  it s a hard language - but they were treating me like i was stupid and refusing to answer my questions when i tried to clarify what they wanted   at the time  my sister was in hospital  so i was already overwhelmed  i stopped behind the bar to have a two minute water break and just take a second to process everything  so while i was lost in thought and sipping water  kevin asks me  can t you see we re busy  i sigh and follow him into the kitchen where he starts laying into me  i mean he was yelling at me about a foot away from my face  so i told him to get the fuck out of my face and pretty much quit on the spot because i could feel a panic attack coming on and i realised it wasn t worth it for under seven pounds per hour   i got called back in a week later for an inquiry  a customer made a complaint about kevin because they d heard him screaming at me from the restaurant  so they had to do an investigation  well  in an attempt to save his own skin  he had alleged that i threatened him with a knife  which was completely untrue  luckily my gm knows he s full of it so nothing will happen to me  but i was sure scared for a moment ,pymfxk

34,A post about the living conditions here in Russia (got inspired by that guy from Denmark),we are  in fact  no longer a totalitarian poor hellhole we were before the 1991  for all communists here  i'm very sad i've disappointed you  but an average russian now lives 3 5 to 4 5 times better than an average soviet citizen in the mid-1980s   ps  i'm not a putin supporter  our system has a lot to be improved in it  but anyway  so  we have    free healthcare  included in the taxes you pay  paid healthcare also exists  but it's mostly cheap - for instance  i had my teeth fixed for about  30 each    4 for painkillers  calling an emergency medical vehicle  skoraya  literally the  urgent medical help  is free  but tipping the medic  5 to  7  is a sign of good manners  surgeries are also free  but there are waiting lines    free school education up to 11th grade  and 5 6 of the universities have the budget-sponsored  seats  stipends are very small  though  mostly  20 to  50 a month    pensions depending on for how long you were working  but usually no less than  150    the percentage of people owning their own flats houses is the highest in europe  peaking at about 85    and  finally  the rental prices  electricity and water bills are relatively small  for instance  renting a 60 m2 2-room flat in the fifth largest city in the country costs about  350 a month with landlord paying all the bills  the bills mostly don't exceed  70  except winter  where the heating prices come in   yes  central heating is installed in almost all buildings    average wage  for comparison   250 for poor regions   350 to  450 in most large cities   700 and up in the polar cities  prices aren't that high there ,pyk0mb

53,Help me Understand Your Philosophy,up until quite recently  i was almost unaware of the anti-work position  i knew that some people are put off by the anxiety of job seeking and the stress of being in the workforce  but i had no idea that a sizeable minority of people on the internet believed that employment ought to be abolished    i have some questions about the anti-work position  i strenuously disagree with leftism  communism  and antiwork advocates  but i want to engage in a dialogue and ask this sub some questions    1   are you communists    communism is a worker-oriented movement      he who does not work  neither shall he eat  2   in your ideal antiwork utopia  would the people sustaining the rest of civilization enjoy more luxuries or be compensated more    all the production  planning  and heavy-lifting would be delegated to a small group of individuals  would they basically live like gods since they would be working to keep all of you alive while you are idle  3   why does the rest of society owe you free stuff    there is a material cost to everything  that material cost is reflected in the price  the quantity of the medium of exchange  with which the labour must be recompensed  why do you get to force people to make your things without compensating them for it   4   besides the potential threat of automation  what made you identify as anti-work    automation is the only compelling argument against work in my opinion 5   how do material progress and technological advancement occur with an idle population  or would all the scientific heavy-lifting be delegated to a small population of intellectuals  6   if capitalists are exploiting workers by taking  unearned  surplus value  how are you not exploiting me by demanding the fruits of my labour without giving anything in return    you sitting around enjoying the fruits of other people's labour while doing nothing is inherently exploitative ,pyydpa
54,I was intimidated by my boss on my birthday.,i had a meeting with my boss on my birthday recently  he gave me a card that some of the people in the office had put together and apologized for not realizing that it was today  he then proceeded to tell me that the company had been considering letting me go due to my attendance  not because i had missed a lot of days  1-2 days a month called out  but because murphy's law seems to strike when i do  i'm in it  and it's essentially just me in my role  so problems can become bigger if neither me nor my supervisor are available to handle them  but you know what  that's not my fucking problem  all that means is the company is understaffing my position  not that i need to never call off sick   he then acknowledged that i am very good at my role  and that everyone in the office loves having me around  which he re-iterated pointing to the card  saying he had nothing to do with it    i work 100 hours a week between this job and my other small business  i need both to survive  the fact that my boss is comfortable casually threatening my livelihood on my birthday because i'm a human being who doesn't feel well sometimes is fucking appalling and it sickens me ,pyvjsu

59,"It's becoming increasingly clear that the ""Please be patient, we are seriously understaffed, since everybody is too lazy to work in this restaurant"" horseshit is failing to pass the reality test.",we live in a large tourist driven region with a huge amount of restaurants  the official count is typically quoted at 900 of them  in the county   the wife and i are guilty of spending way too much time and money at these restaurants   over the last few months we have noticed a real divide taking place when it comes to who is successfully running a thriving operation  and who is crashing and burning    obviously  all of them suffered to some extent over the pandemic  once things loosened up  it really didn't take long for the tourism industry to get back on it's feet  and the hotels and restaurants to be back up to near full  capacity   as this was happening  we noticed that most operations smoothly ramped up and seem to be running well  with a high daily traffic count  and no huge service issues  others are failing horribly  we have two national chain locations   within sight of each other  one we gave up on  since we can't sit for 40 minutes to wait for our cold food  as a grossly short staffed and abused front of the house runs like lunatics to try to keep up  the other place is packed for ten hours a day  and still has no issues with service or quality  we see it in everything from local diners and pizza joints  to the fast food that is now limited to drive through with a dark dining room  since they can't find enough staff to operate it     i'm no economist  but if the majority of the restaurants  in a region that is overrun with them  are doing quite well  yet a significant minority are literally failing  grossly understaffed  empty and pissing off customers left and right   there is a problem that has nothing to do with all the imaginary lazy people that are hiding somewhere  there is a problem with continuing to under pay  under value  and abuse your staff  period  the free market has determined that this is no longer acceptable and workers voted with their feet  yet  strangely  some of you managers and owners seem to be willing to make this a hill that you are willing to die on   good luck with that  might be time to throw a clean shirt on  and do a bit of dining at your competitors  since you  are driving your place off a cliff  and they are doing just fine ,pynetn

91,Labour shortage/housing crisis,every week we have a  managers  meeting   it's just a meeting with some midlevel employees designed to make us feel special  only 3 6 of us are actual  managers   i am a purchaser in a 2 person department  both of us attend this meeting   last week we discussed being short staffed  we are short about 30-40   the main problem the hiring staff  not me  is having is no one could afford working for us and live in our city   instead of simply paying higher starting wages the managers discussed building staff accommodations because corporate does not budget for paying higher employees  we have an average wage that we must hit or be under regardless of cost of living in the region   building staff accommodations is a path to economic slavery  people have no choice but to work for them as their work is now their only way of housing themselves    when a job does not pay wages required to live in the region the work is in economics says the wage must go up  that is capitalism   instead corporations are adding prison benefits as i call them  not sure the actual term  benefits that force you to keep a job because you can't afford to live without them  benefits like healthcare  dental  and now housing   i am hearing more about the  need  for staff accommodations from other business in the rural town i live in and am wondering if this is happening everywhere   employers should have no control over their employees housing ,pys8s6
92,The company I work at decided to implement this new merit system. Basically our version or China's credit score. I'm not active on it. I've been warned.,disclaimer  i actually enjoy my job's daily tasks  programmer  but i hate the constant bullshit  i hate corporate jargon and culture  so fuck'em and fuck'em deep  sorry for the long post but it's kind of a warning to other people   i won't name the place  germany based digital marketing company  pretty big  maybe four months ago everyone gets an email announcing a new merit system  it's basically an application integrated into our network were you can publicly kiss your superiors' arses   i could smell the bullshit right away  as i'm sure all anti-workers would too  so i ignored it  the company is big enough to let some unsophisticated peasant sewer dwellers like myself go unnoticed in these soul crushing social apps  that's how some people in the company see me and my team  i love it  we're like a necessary evil to them   i forgot all about that stupid app  cancelling its email notifications right away helped with that  few months pass  one of my bosses calls me on teams  conversation went something like this   boss - you haven't been active on the arsekissery platform  you must have tons of arsekisses to use  why don't you go there and congratulate your teammates and all the others    ----side note  i had been receiving these credits for months  i can use them to  well  kiss some arses---  me - sorry i forgot all about that since that first email  i'll check it later on  not really my thing though  so maybe i'll pass   boss - what you mean it's not really your thing  everyone's there   me - sorry i'm not very much into social stuff online   boss - but don't you want to recognize other people's work  this is the new tool for that  and it might have beneficial outcomes for some in the long term   me - i prefer to congratulate people in private  i've done it in the past  so i really don't thing i'm gonna use those arsekisses   boss - i think you should reassess your position on this issue  some higher-ups may not like to know that someone in this team has something against arsekissery   me - i'm not gonna use it   boss - ok  we'll talk again in a few days to see if you changed your mind   so this is where i'm at  boss was getting nervous with our conversation  i'm kindly waiting for our next talk regarding this dystopian app   honestly i'm enjoying this  saying no to your superiors it's always a pleasure  however  i know i can tell them to fuck off and i'll get another job in a few weeks if this actually escalates  i kind of hope it does  what pisses me the fuck off is that more people will probably feel the same as me but will have to comply    after our little chat i actually went to the arsekissery platform to check if it was as bad as i imagined  well it did not disappoint  i seriously have a hard time understanding how little self awareness some people can have  who do you think you're fooling with those stupid posts  congratulating others for working 80h weeks  congratulating one self for working that much  blatantly lying about stuff  endless virtue signalling  and boy  don't get me started on the emojis   you know what i feel like doing  spend every credit i have by posting links to this thread in asskissery  i know i probably won't but let me fantasize about it   warning to others  if you work an office job then this might be coming for you also  don't use it unless you're completely desperate for money and cannot find another job  now it's not enough to work your ass off  you have to post how much you love it and how wonderful your superiors are so that everyone can see  it's not the future that's a dystopian nightmare  it's the freaking present ,pyr02l

177,Passive Income vs Work,there seems to be a large number of people who are under the delusion that wealth is a product of work  however  that is not necessarily true  in fact  more often than not  wealth is a product of ownership and investment  almost no one gets rich from working  we anti-workers are rebelling against a system where people at the top grow their wealth by investing  accumulating assets  and receiving passive income from those assets  while billions of people are forced to work low quality  low wage jobs under the threat of destitution   it's interesting that given this dynamic  so many people choose to defend the passive income class  while decrying anti-workers as  lazy  apparently  not wanting to work a crap job is fine  admirable even  when you're rich  but when you're poor and don't want to work a crap job  you're just lazy  ironic   but what really separates an anti-worker from a member of the passive income class is  access to capital  without access to capital  you cannot invest  you cannot accumulate assets  and you  therefore  cannot receive passive income  although  even if access to capital were more available  investment is still inherently risky - there will be winners and losers  and most likely far more losers then winners  typical for gambling  so  basically  the passive income class is inaccessible to most of us   but even if i had access to capital and luck on my side  i wouldn't want to be a member of the passive income class  contrary to what many people think about anti-workers  i do not want to sit on my ass all day while everyone else does all the work  that is not what i want  what i want is a world where everyone contributes what they are able  so that everyone can have what they need  including  as much free time as possible  and a decent standard of living  nothing extravagant  i'm not asking for a mansion and a yacht  just a decent place to live  nutritious food  clean water  high quality healthcare  high quality education  quality infrastructure  public services  public transportation  green space  etc  for the least amount of compulsory work  i would be more than happy to contribute as much of my labor as is necessary to make that society function  but  i am not going to work one more damn minute for the benefit of the passive income class  and if they don't like that  well  what can i say other than   stop being lazy and become productive member of society ,py64tt

179,I don't like to cook anymore,i used to want to be a chef  i'd wanted it since i was 10 years old  i spent all my time cooking  learning new recipes  etc  i knew  as i got older  that i'd have to work very hard to have recognition in the field  no problem   i knew i wouldn't be making a ton of money  but didn't care  i knew it was mainly a  man's field  but didn't care  so i threw my all into it starting at 18  i'm now 26 and i'm done  if the constant sexual harassment that never gets any sort of punishment or recognition  the fact that other women in the industry and as a large are unsupportive and cruel about it  what did you expect  is a common one i from both blue collar and white collar women  or  lol shut up and stop complaining  and the constant physical pain i'm in due to working on my feet for 10-15 hours at a time wasn't enough  the fact that they think they can get away with paying me slave wages is  no  i'm done  i'm not your fucking serf  i'm not your fucking whore  you can either pay me or shut the fuck up  and if any man at any future employment ever tries the shit that was done to me in this industry again  i'll bite his goddamned jugular out  because clearly i have to protect myself  anyway  cooking in general depresses the shit out of me now because it just brings up terrible memories of being mistreated and overworked  take this as a warning and don't let it happen to you  capitalism will kill your interests loves ,py5bmv

184,Wannabes,working class folk who continually engage in rhetoric that s directly in conflict with their best interest is nothing new  however we are getting to witness some new flavors - in the form of the hot topic of the current labor  shortage   who else has seen a fellow laborer  or managerial worker start spouting about people not getting back to work  watching those who ostensibly have been under the thumbs of employers their entire lives march around and spit the vitriol of their oppressors in some strange half-baked petite bourgeois tyrannical fantasy   i had a parts delivery man walk into our shop yesterday to explain that supply line issues are severely affecting the availability of auto parts - which is true - but he immediately went into a spiel about how the root cause is a worker shortage due to government  handouts   what s all the more depressing is my co-workers nodding on in agreement and somehow steering the conversation to the all important hot button topic of gas prices under the biden administration   having such a devastating lack of self awareness to where i m active in the societal persecution of my fellow workers  couldn t be me    having my politics reduced to vomiting 2-3 headlines that the monied class has been relentlessly bludgeoning me over the head with  couldn t be me     wishing to justify my suffering under employment by taking solace in the notion that others must suffer as well  couldn t be me   wishing to justify my suffering by diluting myself into thinking one day i may become an oppressor myself  couldn t be me    we are all victims of capitalism  but i can t help but wince in disgust when watching someone play wholeheartedly into their own suffering  or the suffering of peoples they ve been told are somehow beneath them    hope yall have an easy one at work today  one free of noxious political takes ,pyi4bo

195,the implications of higher wages/working less in the US?,i think the standard of living is horrible for a good portion of us citizens  so i'm all for raising wages at the expense of companies  but where  does  the money corporations make go  all these huge corporations are publicly traded so now i'm down the rabbit hole of looking at the shareholder distribution for companies like amazon  it looks like bezos owns 11  of amazon which is actually an absurd amount  but the rest seems pretty randomly distributed with no big stakeholders apart from mutual fund type companies which don't count because they are investing on the behalf of middle class joes  right  so say wages increase  amazon makes less money  which results in its stock price declining  obviously bezos wont be affected  but lots of average joes will be  a bunch of people relying on their money tied up in the stock market for retirement will be screwed    ok so after that reset  yeah a bunch of middle class oldies will be screwed over but what else  at that point less money going towards ceos through their huge holding of shares  hmm doesnt seem so bad  i suppose cus im not an oldie abt to retire   also i have basically no knowledge regarding the economy this is so elementary ik please somebody explain it to me better,pybkql

263,My Bosses and Job Make Me Sick :(,hi everyone   long time lurker  finally made an account not too long ago  so here is my problem in a nutshell  summary  and i hope i can get some opinions on next steps   3 ish months ago  i started a new job  they said it'd be job that evolved over time to potential promotion opportunities  i'd be working for the main company and the one the owner also owns that is connected in the same industry  administrative hr accounting type deal  before i even start  i notice the pay is less than what i agreed to  i needed the job so i took it  i know  bad idea but still my dentist had talked me into expensive procedures while i was on anxiety meds to get my vaccine  needle phobia is terrible from cptsd  thousands i didn't have and he knew it  first time he's ever done that  anyway  back to the job   the first month  my computer doesn't work well  it crashes  my boss knows it as she had it before i did  it freezes  deletes work  slows me down  then it wouldn't start up or charge  then  the people at the second company that i am supposed to help refuse to talk to me  ghost me  ask me to move all the time so i can't get work done and they made fun of me  i just wanted respect for the work i did  i voice ideas and concerns like i'm asked to  then the owner  boss' boss  accidentally emails me the most insulting pip  performance improvement plan  ever by accident  yes  accident  my boss is a deer in headlights when i show her that and i am fuming    during the meeting  i tell them that was not okay and the wording made me sound like a moron  not to mention i was blamed for the computer issues slowing me down not working  being shy  not talking a ton in meetings  before i knew even what the company was doing currently so how can i have ideas  not being a team player and said i didn't do anything to deserve respect yet so i needed to grow up   the following 2 months  i decide i need money so i'll improve myself  even bs can be useful fuel for self improvement - especially anger  that fire gets me going ha    then i was sick and had to take off  i had symptoms of the current virus floating around and i was told to stay home 2 weeks  2 days i couldn't even work with a fever over 101  they told me any time i have a fever stay home until it's gone for 3 days  i did that but my doc says to stay home one more week to be safe and i have text messages approving it    most recent  i found out i'm allergic to certain dog breeds which i didn't know  and the second company that i'm only at once a week if that has a lot of animals daily  i had been having rashes  migraines  stuffy nose  etc  every time i went but i thought it was stress  so i stay home and work  emailing 30 min after starting that i'd be home and available but i wasn't feeling well due to migraines    my 90 day review was amazing  everyone in the office said i excel at everything i do  i did a 180 complete turn around on my social skills  i earned respect  and nothing was going wrong  i even got a raise  then  this next thing    yesterday  i get a written warning  they i was at home working 23  of the time since starting work and i didn't email tell someone fast enough i was staying home so they will call my 7 1 2 hours of work that day a no call no show even though i worked  they said they don't think i can work while sick if they cannot do it themselves  i have two types of migraines  ptsd related and allergy stress  one i cannot get out of bed with  the other it depends    i also had the current virus going around twice and nearly died  i have long-term damage that i told them i may need to stay home for  too  it is random  they agreed  plus  i've worked through horrible medication side effects and allergic reactions  nausea  anxiety attacks  etc  they had the gull to tell me they think i do not work  wtf   the policies they say i broke aren't anywhere in a handbook  online  etc  i should know  i am rewriting it for them  so  should i quit without something lined up even though i do need the money or go  my left arm and side of my chest has been going numb or throbbing and my psychiatrist thinks this job is going to hurt me    i'm used to being a pushover but i stood up for myself in the meetings  any advice  i'm so sad  i was unemployed for 2020 and this is the first one i could find  i already do yoga  eat healthy  stretch  exercise  do mindfulness  etc  i'm one of the highest functioning people with 23 years of daily abuse and brainwashing my doc has seen in all his years and that says something good  i heard them make fun of my disability  ptsd  amp  meniere's  too  and they say they don't care about that i need to do what they tell me to    i do not feel safe as it is a small office  too  and they made fun of my fear of getting sick again  12 people in a less than 700 sqft space  no distancing  i didn't know that'd be the case when i got hired or stayed there  am i being a baby  should i suck it up ,py963y

269,Need to vent,not sure if people come to this subreddit to read others' sob stories  i don't  and it seems like most posts here are commentary on image macros social media posts  but i thought i'd share what happened to me today because it's just another punch in the guts to this disillusioned prole   anyways  not to go into an inordinate amount of detail  but i've been unemployed since june  when i declined to re-sign my contract with my previous employer and had a halfbaked dream where i would start making content for social media full time   to be clear  i think that this is a viable career path for some and perhaps even the solution to breaking out of traditional ideas for work income and monetising individuals' creative potential on the internet   but  it just isn't for me  i lack the discipline and the vision  so i started to look for another job     at the end of july  i interviewed for a job  and got offered the position  signing a contract for a position starting at the end of november   there were some red flags from the beginning  the ad that i responded to was a bit of a bait and switch because it listed multiple positions open  including one in august  but when i asked about that  they told me that it was filled   even after i had signed the contract  i continued to see the ad posted online  up until very recently   so  i wasn't totally shocked when i got a call from the recruiter who had been the go-between for me and the employer  and he told me that the position i had signed a contract to fill no longer existed   apparently the current employee would be continuing on in the position   so  i spent two months under the false impression that my job search was over  and now i might be deprived of several more months of work as i begin from scratch  i was unknowingly used as an insurance policy for a company that effortlessly cast me aside when i wasn't needed   i come to this sub to get a sense of solidarity with working people so i hope this story resonates with some of you   we need to keep telling ourselves that there's nothing wrong with having a job  but that you can never trust an employer because you are just a tool for them to use and discard   stay strong  fuck a job ,pxsnjr

288,Well if it isn't karma for my own thoughts {long},so a year ago  the hotel i devoted 7 years of my life to got sold out from under us  right after  a co-worker and great friend of mine introduced me to a position at their small business that sounded amazing  a year later  my one year anniversary is the 29th  and i'm dealing with a lot of mental struggles   in this year i've been on two different antidepressants  neither did what i needed it to  a few mental breaks thrown in  all out screaming at my boss man  co-workers husband  and a complete disregard for my working career later  i was finally feeling on september 15th that it was almost time for one of those grippy socks three day retreats    but alas i refused    so much so i went out to the bars with my husband and some friends  that saturday night     monday morning rolled around and i could barely get out of bed  a hangover  no  a dreaded sickness best to be described as  that one time i got mono  but  spicier   hubby went to work  i stayed home from work  first time calling out right before my shift  in over a year  felt so wrong  i did tell boss lady that hubby jokingly said the dreaded covid but i really didn't think it was that    this worried her    now  her and her husband have not gotten the vaccine  not my body not my problem  our fourth worker and i did get the vaccines in the modern red variety  however i do frequent help desks of little old fellas and ladies so i didn't want to bring my possibly covid infected body near work  plus  a break sounds nice    so tuesday i go get a test  it's the spit and mail kind like a dna test  simple enough    wednesday the state labs receive it  i feel reassured it's not actually covid  just a cold    thursday i get my results  it's the covid  i'm now out four days of work and looking at many more    fast forward to today  next tuesday  and i've missed 7 days of work  i feel 100  better  but i still must wait for a negative test  which with my luck won't happen for a couple of weeks    all of this to say i now  desperately  don't want to go back to work  but how do i explain that  i've got a crafting business i've not had time to focus on  i have some pretty bad depression to work on  i've got a lot of house renovations to catch up on  none of these are compatible with my current job setup    having 11 days off to be a homebody  not wear tight clothes  and not have to talk to anyone but my husband has been amazing  i want to be a stay-at-home wife now    so i guess  tldr  if you need a grippy socks retreat  take it or suffer from the effects of not prioritizing yourself ,pxn0om

307,A Week Away and Suddenly I Can Eat,tw  physical illness  vomiting  hello  i just joined and am now addicted to this subreddit  while lurking i read a story similar to mine and it made me realize just how bad this job is treating me   i had a week of vacation this month  the last one i took being in february for the same amount of time  for context  my schedule is monday  wednesday  saturday and sunday for week 1 and wednesday  friday for week 2  so while i had only really had 3 days of vacation  i was actually out of office for a whole week    now  a month or so before my vacation i literally had to stop eating before my shift because i would throw up  without fail  even if i ate generally considered  safe  foods  i would end up throwing up minutes before leaving for work  and sometimes even at work  i went to the dr after much pushing from my boyfriend and they didn't have a clue  soon i resigned to bringing a lunch to work and munching there  which actually worked  but i had a lot of anxiety about eating while at my job for multiple reasons   i take the week off  that entire week i'm able to eat at any point  even that same time i would have before my shift  and not throw up once  i didn't correlate it to my job at all until i read a similar story on here   is it really so common to experience physical illnesses due to stressful jobs ,pxpznv
308,Got my first job. Want to quit after first shift,so i thought having a job would be nice  i am not being forced to work or anything  i just have expensive hobbies and thought i d be self sufficient  i got a job in food and yeah  not a fan  i am so awful at it    i also don t like my manager very much  i work at a small christian restaurant and during my interview i forgot about how you need to dress up  i came into the interview dressed how i usually do  i was wearing a comic tee  high rise acid wash jeans with rips from the top of my thigh down and fishnets underneath  i also had an early 2000 s grunge hairstyle which means i blew it out and teased it a lot without any combing and tons of hairspray    the black nails  chains  and heavy trad makeup probably wasn t doing me any favors either  i only got hired because my friend s mom is the assistant manager  and my friend s boyfriend also work there  it s kind of a you know somebody you re in kind of thing around where i live  but during the interview the manager told me that i should know it s a christian business and that all employees are expected to be dressed clean and no profanity is allowed  so i didn t like her even before i began working there   she scheduled me closing every single day i work  not to mention i work from 4-8  i get home from school at 3 35 and live half an hour away from work  i m a full time  minor  student and this is my vet first ever job  i told her it isn t possible for me to be there on time and she said it s not her problem and it s my responsibility to relieve the person working before me    oh  and on my first shift ever she didn t give me a single break until 10 minutes before closing time  my shift was only 4 5 hours  but i thought minors were required breaks  even then  she told me if i want to leave early i should get to finishing the pre closing duties  so i took my break texting my mom telling her i ll probably be getting off later than i thought i was going to be originally since i had so much cleaning to do   my friends are telling me i m being selfish for wanting to quit after only one shift  and that i will get better after i work more and get the routine down  but i hate the food business  i just wanted an easy job to do after school that didn t make me stay after 1-2 hours after my scheduled time to clean dough and old food out of mixers and bowls ,pxn106

353,It's never been as bad as it is now.,i'm rather struck by how much anarchist and traditional thinkers have in common with regard to criticisms of capital and of the supposed  labor ethic  i'll go ahead and do a little bit of contrast  from what i've read of those authors  to put the horror and abnormality of our modern situation into perspective   in antiquity  labor was not a virtue  no such thing as a labor ethic existed  instead  it was seen as a divine punishment  one of the traditionalists points out that the etymological root for  labor  which is the latin word laborare  denotes suffering  a remanant of this meaning is carried forward into modern english by the term  labor  as applied in child birth   in the past  they believed that being born a peasant or a slave was ill fortune  today  it's everybody's misfortune  in the modern world  there is no differentiation at all and everyone is forced to work no matter his virtues  the same traditionalist points out that  he who does not work shall not eat  is a cruel modern axiom that was never believed  brahmana  the priestly caste in ancient india  were forbidden to work except when times were exceptionally harsh   moderns are valued in the class system only according to the amount of money they produce  in the class system  honor is never considered  instead  those of low class are dejected and seen as inferior  only the upper class holds any dignity in modernity  however  in the past  under the caste system  each caste had equal dignity by according to its divine destiny   the class system is very backwards  in fact  the more honorable you are  the less money you will make  because grifting and hustling is the profession of the rich  to be competitive  you must conform  you must become a  used car salesman  or  sell yourself  in contrast  various indo-european societies of the past would put liars to death  lying was a mortal sin  not a way of life    the caste system was based around vocational honor  and each caste was held to be of equal dignity  this is represented in ancient india as the body of brahma  each of its four parts corresponding to one of the castes  the legs were the laborers  the thighs were the producers  the arms were the warriors  and the mouth was the priests  brahma could not exist without any one part  and so each one was held to the same dignity  in the modern world  however  the working class is without special dignity  it could be replaced tomorrow with machines and the upper classes would not mourn it  the class structure is rife with avaricious jealousy  whereas in the past  each caste was happy to fulfil its vocation to retain its honor  since it was ordained impersonally by god  in india  the caste system was not essentially hereditary  but instead individualistic and based off of a person's strengths and virtues  the goal was inner harmony  rather than class conflict and inequality   if you advised an ancient man to  sell himself  he'd have thought you asked him to be a prostitute  modern wage labor is  likewise  not very different from selling your body for sex  we give up our time  our energy  our health  and our spirit for someone else's pleasure  at the end of your career  you're used up  riddled with diseases  and rife with trauma  all for the benefit of someone else  rather than enjoyable and relationally fulfilling  as well as spiritually consecrated  the  sex  of  selling yourself  is alienating and destructive  such is labor  rather than  ludic  play   in the past  commercial establishments were always subordinated to principle and rulership  guilds were chartered by kings and operated within narrow boundaries  they were not competitive  but rather  anti-competitive  they fixed prices and cut out competition  keeping the pace of work slow and prices high  allowing them to focus on quality  perfection  honor  and the dignity of the craftsmen  even marx spoke about the dignity of the craftsman's intrinsic relationship to his works  and how modernity alienates the craftsman away with its demands for speed and output   accordingly  even mundane goods in the past were designed thoughtfully and with intricate care  craftsmen wanted to make beautiful goods to honor and reflect the divine rather than to please their managers  there was a serious spiritual underpinning behind guilds as well  in ancient rome  corporations had lares  which were like spirits of the place  craftsmen would offer to these lares  and their work revolved around honoring them  rather than simply turning profit  in the medieval germanic zunften  there were patron spirits that filled a similar role   the ancient corporations and guilds also had a hierarchical personal nature  kind of like a family  the leader of a corporation cared for the well being of his craftsmen  and they desired to work with the leader as a unit in turn  it was organic and personal  unlike dehumanized modern workplaces  where the only object of the leadership is profit and exploitation   even war was not as destructive  in the middle ages  battles were sometimes won without even a single blow being struck  other times  the destruction that could be wreaked was limited without the aid of modern technology  there was no military-industrial complex -- war was a virtue of its own and wasn't motivated by profit-seeking  warriors held a sacred place in society and were held to be a prime example of honorable sacrifice  sacrifice itself is a symbol against materialism and industrialism  because  to sacrifice  one must give up attachment to greed and material things  to be a warrior  then  was to essentially forego greed entirely  this is reflected in the dialogue between arjuna and krishna in the bhagavad gita  arjuna  a warrior  struggles to muster the courage to fight -- but krishna reminds him that he will die if he fights or not  so he might as well fight  either he earns glory in death  or victory in life  profit never enters the equation   war was seen as a path to enlightenment through sacrifice  not as a mere means to secure economic or geopolitical advantages as is the case today  modern colonialism on the other hand  as an unlikely traditionalist writes  was driven entirely by expansionistic greed and a false sense of superiority on the part of europeans during the renaissance and enlightenment  societies which knew sacrifice and the divine  such as the aztecs  were tragically genocided and enslaved by europeans for the sake of profit   ancient man worked only as much as he needed to  being free from the artificial generation of needs under capitalism  there is an anecdote from the modern era in which a british officer went to china and remarked how  when he increased native chinese wages on a farm  the chinese workers simply worked less proportional to the wage increase rather than to work harder  as the british were accustomed to  of course  they were interpreted to be  lazy  rather than human   anarchists and traditionalists both point out how peasants and slaves had it better than modern wage laborers  medieval peasants had more days off than office workers  on top of having intact families and central meaning in their lives  never before was capitalistic restlessness so prevalent   the same certain traditionalist i've been discussing also points out something interesting  which is akin to what others have called commodification  modern capitalism liberalism  in reducing people to producers and consumers  presents them a false sense of individuality  people believe that they can find meaning in what they consume or buy  they are presented false lifestyles and identifies by capitalism  for example  ford and chevrolet  coke and pepsi have formed  cultural  shibboleths  a  smoker  feels pressured to smoke  due to propaganda campaigns  and pressures his friends to smoke in turn  each of whom identifies with a different brand of cigarettes  he's a marlboro man  she's a newport girl  etc  etc  but ultimately  none of this has anything at all to do with personality  these are just artificial inflictions made by capitalism to justify the labor cycle and have nothing to do with higher values  instead of principles  instead of gens  ethnos  and familia  people have brands   in antiquity  people had personalities by virtue of their dharma  or inner nature  karma and heredity  as well as astrological influences  would determine a person's vocation  traits  susceptibilities  and their spiritual disposition  they possessed personalities and vocations  and it was seen as harmonious that they followed them    this is the amor fati  or the classical pronouncement that you should  be who you are  after having learned what that is  this was based in something that couldn't be inflicted or changed by a capitalistic environment  but rather which was intrinsic and immutable  this puts the liberal socialist desire to reduce people to products of their environments into perspective  and moreover the general attempt to homogenize humanity and culture  the environment is capital labor  nobody can be unsuitable for work if they are molded by capital labor  and yet  the hippie generation shows a particular resurgence of immutable spirit against conformism in general  and many people from around the world  having moved to the capitalistic west  endeavor to keep their cultures  even if it's sometimes a failing battle   religion has been reduced to a mere accessory and it is no longer seen as essential -- mostly because it isn't  productive  modern society refuses to make accommodations for religious practices  particularly those skeptical of labor  a buddhist cannot get an exemption from work  he must work -- his religion means nothing to capital  even if work might bring him away from enlightenment and suck him back into samsara   all told  it should be evident that capitalism  and its modern counterparts  is a truly unique evil  it's mammon made incarnate -- an oligarchy of greed and malevolence  the traditionalists and anarchists are right to say that it shares similarities with calvinism  we see constant dissolution and  freedom  combined with increasingly strict moralization and conformism  work is being made a principle  while at the same time we're told that the telos of work is to be free from work  work will bring us to heaven  we're told  while our ancestors realized long ago the opposite   the traditionalists say that calvinism and puritanism are degraded forms of spirituality  which have  involuted  from their superior antecedents  rather than having in its sights the immaterial and divine  calvinism concerns itself with petty morality and the immediacy of work  it is more  horizontal  than it is  vertical  buddhism  on the other hand  with its seeking of the unconditioning of the self and freedom from agitation  dukkha  wishes to break people free from brutish necessity and  survival   there was at one point in history acknowledgement of all the ills we're suffering today  in fact  they were presaged  the traditionalist here referenced would have stated  according to his theory of the regression of the castes  the the final age  the kali yuga  is characterized by the condition of the peasantry and of reduction to labor  he was right  we're all serfs  and we cannot escape but upward  let's hope that something can bring this insane work-based misery to an end  and signal a new beginning of an age of light ,pxpzev

369,"My first work experience in life was with Amazon, and I've hated work so much ever since that I haven't been able to land another one.",so  it all starts in 2017  i was 19 at the time  soon to be 20  after failind and giving up on college  i realised that i had to pay off my student loan somehow and needed to get a job for it  an amazon warehouse in my city was doing some sort of presentation of their work  specifically aimed at unemployed people  and i was told to go there and check it  remember  i was young and impressionable back then  at the end of the presentation  they made us do a short test  17 questions  about safety and stuff related to logistics  and i learned later on that it helped them decide which shift to give us  i made it with 16 out of 17 correct answers and joined amazon 2 weeks later        fast-forward to a year later  at the time  i had been trained to do almost every possible tasks in the warehouse  and was the only one in my shift able to do it  even though we were more than 500  and whenever help was needed somewhere  i was the one called  which means i did around 6-7 different tasks every day when everyone else only did 1  i had to move pallets that weighed around 1 metric ton with a manual pallet jack  because they kept saying they were  too busy  to train me for an electric one  while i kept seeing people who didn't work with pallets at all getting trained to use an electric pallet jack  which resulted in my shoulders being damaged to the point where i can't lift them high enough anymore  and one day  they put me as head of a small group  that i had nicknamed  cart pushers  because that's all we ever did  that job was a rotating one which mean the lead changed every day  and they gave me the most useless team possible  so i was basically the only one doing any work  guess who they blamed when work didn't go fast enough  yup  me        i was mainly trained in receive  and one of the tasks there had a productivity quota of 1 000 items an hour  which was basically impossible to reach when we only received big items like coffee makers  and i ended up getting chewed on every day because i couldn't reach the quota  i often worked at the hazmat storage area with no way to protect myself from whatever escaped from corrosive and flammable stuff  which ended up taking a toll on my lungs as well as give me migraines  but what really pushed me over the edge  was the fact that  whenever i had to take a sick day because my body couldn't keep up anymore  hr would call me when i got back to tell me about how  productivity is important  and if you don't come for a single day it will affect the entire warehouse  so i got burned out  and simply decided to stop showing up for work after 2 years of nearly flawless commute  it took them 2 months to actually fire me  and ever since then i haven't been able to land a single job  because i keep remembering how much of a slave i was in amazon        sorry if i've made any mistake in this  english isn't my main language ,pxpy87

Are our work laptops monitored?,i work as a software engineer at a big company in the netherlands    i can't be productive 8 hours everyday  it's a stressful job    i was thinking of spending an hour or two on reddit everyday at work  i can't use it on my phone cause teams changes my status to idle within a couple of minutes  so i have to use reddit on my work pc   here is my question though  ever since working from home became the norm i have been hearing now managers get reports about our laptop activities  i don't know if they get actual browsing histories  idle status or percentage of time spent on each application  i have seen that on a lot of youtube channels and have personal experience from my last job where i would get a call if i was idle for long  this makes it harder for me to relax and slack off a bit   what are your thoughts  anyone here with experience ,pxpybc

386,I decided to ghost my job after eight long years,yesterday i made a post  now deleted  about whether or not i should quit my long term grocery store job  properly  or simply stop showing up    the results were a mixed bag  a lot of people said if the job and my manager have been good to me  which they mostly have  then i should finish up my two weeks and take it on the chin    i chose the opposite  i m supposed to be working 12 30-9 right now but instead i m sitting here in sweatpants with my feet kicked up  my managers aren t allowed to provide references for employees seeking new jobs  and they aren t allowed to disclose work history when other employers call about a prospective employee who s seeking a new job    so i said fuck it  after eight years  literally the only job i ve ever known  i m saying fuck it  started there at 16  worked my way up the ladder  and here i am at 24 completely miserable with nothing to show for it  i had to fight for every raise and every promotion  and after all that  what was it for  to proudly state that i m a glorified babysitter charged with the task of supervising 16 17 year olds  no thanks    i m also not doing this without a safety net  i have enough money between my bank and investments to cover  6 months of expenses  i ve also been applying to jobs like crazy and i have an interview set up for next week already    fuck it ,pxzmj5

388,Bait &amp; Switch and inspiration from this sub,i'm am on call field service tech and i get a variety of calls ranging in skill level  time required  equipment needed  etc  couple days ago i was set up to do 3 jobs  3 different days  the acct guy calls me and reads the description and it sounds identical to what i've done half dozen times or so before -- go to the site   de-install  or sometimes just pick up a piece of equipment  take it to fedex and send it out  i opened the app we use and it was the same description as the jobs i'd sooner before   i get to the site yesterday and there are two other guys there  a huge warehouse full of old boxes covered in dirt  bird shit  a couple of dead birds  dust and it was a mess  site manager said one of us needed to be certified to run a forklift  none of us is  i'm like wtf  i'm here to pick up a freaking router    message the acct guy to call me  he doesn't  so i can him eventually  first  he says that he was sure he explained the job to me over the phone which is simply not true or i wouldn't have taken it  i'm not trained for that shit and have no idea what i'm doing  then he says well  this is a totally new project and he really didn't know much about it  even after explaining what was involved  he expected me to stay  i don't know if he's trying the truth or if someone is not giving him all the info  but i do know it's a shitty job that nobody wants and there's a greater likelihood than not that they would withhold information because a person is less likely to leave a job once they already arrived  in other words sucker them into it   i wanna thank y'all in this sub though for inspiring me to fucking say no  no more  after i cooled down a bit  i called back and passionately but professionally explained why this stunt was wrong  how it affected me  affected the other two people who were there  affected the client  affected the site managers  showed the wasted time  money and other resources  pointed out how short-sighted this was and on and on until i felt him glaze over and force me to stop talking  do i think he cares  hell no  will he change  probably not  but the details are on the record as a cya move and it felt better then yelling and screaming   i've been pushing back like this quite a bit lately  it really showed how much shit i've been letting go and my philosophy is this  every time we let ourselves get shit on  we're actively lowering the bar for the collective that much more  the more of us who say no  no more  the greater leverage we'll have  in theory  of course  other factors make this easier said than done    hope this contributes to a growing movement of fellow workers who've had it and are done with the abuse  cuz that's exactly what this is ,py0rk6

390,There should be a special place in hell for recruiters,i saw a couple jobs on our local platform that i thought would be better  and more stable  than my present job so i decided to apply on friday    fast forward to monday and i am driving to work  i stop at a light and realize that i missed a call from one of the places i applied  i quickly listen to the voicemail that was left and it says i was short listed and i should return a call  i don't use my phone while driving  vehicle in motion  so i try to call them back when i get to work  i get no answer so i leave a message on the  answering machine  and with the receptionist  no call is returned  i try again yesterday and still no response so i leave another message  at this point i am beyond frustrated because i'm wondering why exactly do i have to be running behind this lady like i'm begging her to hire me  needless to say i did not receive a call back    this morning i'm going through the platform to see if there is anything else i can apply for and i realize i don't see the posting that i applied for  it appears they deleted the listing and i recon it wasn't supposed to be posted in the first place because there is no way they would fill a position over the weekend when they aren't even open  i'm glad no one had the decency to simply call back and say that  i'm sorry the position is no longer available  because now i know to never use that company  large insurance company  or apply for anything there ever again    i'm so pissed i wasted all that time editing my resume and cover letter plus filling out the application and answering their bullshit questions  it's not even the first time they did this shit  i applied with them last year and the same thing happened where they deleted the listing  i didn't even know it was them this time because they didn't disclose any company information  it's only after i called them i realized it was them  fool me once blah blah   they should start making recruiters pay you a stipend or something so they stop doing this bullshit ,pxznbc

424,"Preaching to the choir, but honestly we need to keep talking about it.",it has become impossible to afford living at the baseline income for americans  and even attempting to keep up is futile         if you were to work for  15 an hour  40 hours a week  all 52 weeks in a year  you only make  31 200 before taxes         if the 2019 median wage listed for an individual american citizen to make is  34 248 and the government takes roughly 30  of that in income tax  that brings us down to  23 974  rounding upwards on the change  we will call rent  1000 a month  which is a conservative estimation for most people  so now we're reduced to  11 974  utilities for the home  internet and a phone are all also necessary to function in today's world  with another conservative estimate  we can package all those into  200 a month  although it's likely more  which brings us to  9 574  keep in mind that we still need to eat  all year long  even with careful budgeting  each meal you eat will average  5  3 times a day  over 7 days a week with 52 weeks in a year  which now brings our expendible income to  4 114  except that we didn't consider the price of gas or vehicle costs  if gas is  3 a gallon and the average person drives roughly 14 000 miles per year  with an average of 24 mpg in most cars  we've spent enough on gas to where we would only have  2 365 left  if we were finished  in my state  car insurance is the most expensive in america  but we can just say the average person might spend  100 on insurance per month  which lowers our total to  1 165 before considering vehicle maintenance or car payments  which will easily eat the remainder of everything we made for the year and likely push us into a steadily building debt for years to come         i didn't factor in sales tax  clothing  entertainment  new technology  having children  and obviously forget being able to save or invest any of that for the future         the issue isn't the work  it's the system that houses the work  it's the manipulation to make us all believe that we are drowning  simply for being born  and that working hard is the only way to swim to the surface to stay afloat  it's not a matter of contributing to society as a whole  it's about servitude and exhausting all of us to a point where we no longer have the drive to stand up for ourselves and point out how this whole thing an abomination to the human experience         we all deserve better  we all should be given the opportunity to simply live like house cats if we choose  we deserve free shelter  food  healthcare and a nationwide wide transportation system that doesn't suck  we should be given a baseline universal pay that meets the minimal needs of every individual while consistently growing to match inflation  so at no point does the cost of living overwhelm the universal income  meanwhile  employment will continue to thrive because most people will still desire more than the bare minimum  employers won't have to pay individuals as much per hour to enhance their lives  because their living expenses are already covered  so in turn  the employers would pay more towards the income tax system which feeds the universal balance for all   10 an hour at work will feel more like  40 an hour because inflation will always be managed         maybe not exactly this system  this is just a frustrated rant  but you get the idea  something needs to change because it's only been getting worse and every decade drags us away from the surface and deeper into the abyss  i absolutely care what happens to the generations that follow mine  and it's cruel that the people who came before me were happy to steal from me to feed themselves before i was even ready to enter into the working world          how would all this effect the economy  the capitalists would ask  and honestly  just one idea of many  but if thousands of individuals didn't make half of a million dollars or more per year and then dodge taxes on all of it  we would easily be able to afford to keep the entire nation afloat         we all know that the only thing keeping us down is other people who were either born rich  with limitless opportunities  or was born with very little and took advantage of others to get ahead  there are very few ethical paths to success and our society rewards the worst of us         this is my country  and it fucking sucks ,px7gt6

479,Just got hired and feel worse than I did before.,this may come out as some word vomit so i apologize in advance  if anything i may just be venting out some pent up frustration and i'm on mobile so formatting will be all over the place    i recently  as in 30 minutes ago  got hired as a global sanctions analyst  it reads as a decent gig on paper and it pays 51 000 usd which is okay for my location  what really crushed me is the day is 8 30-5 30  and with commute i'll be leaving at 7 30 and not getting home until about 6 30  i know this isn't crazy absurd hours like many people work  but it just feels preemptively exhausting   for some background  i graduated in may 2020 with a master's degree in international security from an incredibly prestigious university  actually ranked top 10 internationally for my program  not a flex  i just thought it would actually make a difference in my job hunt  between my b s  and m a  i was a middle school teacher which i enjoyed immensely  even for the ludicrously low pay  1 600 usd a month  so my resume isn't just school and internships  after i graduated i had an incredibly hard time finding work as it was right as the pandemic was beginning in full swing and starting to be taken seriously  i eventually found contract work as an aml analyst  anti-money laundering  it was by no means what i wanted to do or engaging  but it was remote and september and i had gone nearly 4 months of job hunting and needed an income  it was easy and since it was remote i enjoyed it  my contract ended in april and i've been job hunting since  i was almost exclusively applying for remote work because even if i hated it  i'm at least at home with my wife  also remote working  and dogs  quite literally 700 applications  not a hyperbole  and 5 months later i feel like i'm in a  beggars can't be choosers  situation    the nail in the coffin which made me want to vent was after the job offer phone call came  another quick phone call came after  it was the head of recruiting who set up my interview confirming the 8 30-5 30 workday was acceptable  i agreed  but stated  at least once a month i'll have to leave at 5 00  my wife and i moved across the country to be closer to family to help out with my grandmother and i'll have to take her to the doctor and help out  in my mind that was incredibly reasonable  she responsed with  oh  hm  is there no one else that can do that  i'll have to go ask the manager in charge of you about that  i'll get back to you   like first of all  no there isn't  if there was i wouldn't have left beautiful colorado for oklahoma lol    so now  after nearly a thousand applications  refilling information that's already in my resume  countless cover letters  and a hard earned master's that was soul-sucking at times  i might get a job that will require nearly 11 hours of my day  including commute  and is considering letting me help take care of my grandmother    so now  i feel worse than i did while filling out applications and feeling horrible by not contributing an income to my household  albeit my wife has been incredibly thoughtful and lovely about it all  bless her ,px8gad

507,I think a big part of anti-work should be considerate of children like me (14 years old) who also sort of work like attending school and thus needs to focus on altering the education system as well.,  which was reintroduced for this year  in greece we work sit in school for 35 hours in high school and have to do homework which would assuming a high schooler does 2 hours of homework each day is 14 extra hours   so thats 49 hours just for school  that's more than the 40 hour work week that's like a standard for jobs  no wonder i felt that middle school which i would say takes a tiny bit less of your precious time at 32 hours just to sit at school so that would make it 47 hours sitting in school   homework  children should be able to enjoy their lives while they are at that stage where they don't have to worry about money and shit  this is insane  why is no one talking about this  a child shouldn't work more than an adult  in addition to all the stress from the tests and you wonder why we have high school drop outs  school should be about learning stuff that would be useful to you in every day life like better sex education  better political education  more philosophy education and that's pretty much it   every other subject aside from basic mathematics is useless  so we would have a total of 6 subjects   politics  philosophy  sex education  basic maths  english language and native language  whilst having to go to school for about 2-3 hours per day and no homework  and you could start this school at any age voluntarily  everything else that is useless for everyday life would be thrown out the window  and instead it would be put in  child universities  basically its for example if you want to study biology you go there and you study everything you need for biology  only what you need and once you are done you come out with a biology degree  you can start this at any age after attending the first school with the 6 subjects  this would improve children's students live's so much    students of the world unite ,px4ilz

526,Work literally makes me sick (no graphic details I promise),i usually lurk here  no posts  but i m very grateful for this sub  it s helped me understand repeatedly what exploitation is  i d worked 3 minimum wage jobs by age 18  and i was a full-time uni student at the time - i know what being exploited feels like  but somehow i fell for it every single time   the 4th is no exception   i graduated this year and got a job by september  in an adjacent field  that pays okay  calculated it out to about  26 hr  not a lot for big city living at least in my area  but enoughish  imagine my joy at such a difficult time   cut to me throwing up repeatedly  an average of four times  at least three days of the work week  i just found out recently  after a month  that i m doing the job of not only my entry-level position  which tbh is already 3 jobs  record-keeping  project initiation and planning  and revising current projects to suit the  business needs  but also the position directly above mine  the one i would be  promoted  to  for one salary of course  i got the desk of the person who previously had that job  and they didn t do anything at all to clean it up - left open food  non-perishable at least  there even  it was very very disorganized  and i was expected to suddenly wrap up six months old to a year old projects after a week of training  little guidance  too   im so used to being exploited i tried to convince myself that i could do it  the financial and social pressures of having a job are too real  i think i nearly gaslit myself into a medical crisis   i think i need to quit soon  it s so sad to me that i - a desirable new hire - am treated so poorly  no wonder they have so many employees and have been understaffed for so long   tl dr new job has me puking and i m tired of having to ignore my ptsd symptoms just to be a  good employee   if you read any of it thanks  lt 3 i know it s a horrific situation globally but my health and yours still matter ,pxavoy

Anyone want to team up on any small projects to help escape the rat race?,  im tired of working on projects i dont enjoy for at least 10 years  dealing with toxic coworkers  getting paid less than i am worth   looking to try again doing small projects but this time with someone with a similar attitude   i have tried this already  4  times and failed  but each time i learned from my mistakes and got better with execution  ive done mainly website work with databases  but the last project i did was an android   ios app    i enjoy programming and design and still want to try something on my own     nobody is coming to save me or help even a little in my area    i dont expect instant success  i just want to get closer to getting out of my current situation     i would rather try to team up with someone here instead of posting memes or asking my gov to change because neither of these will change my situation     i dont live in usa  but most people i know are struggling  people in my province earn less than  2 hour and its difficult to make ends meet especially now with all the covid regulations wife's friend just posted a whatsapp status message of splitting 1 egg for 3 people as a way of expressing how to be  not sure what the word is in english  thrifty when struggling    english is my second language but i think i am good enough to do projects together    if you are interested in teaming up  dm me with your into  i wont respond here after seeing toxic replies in other threads ,px33ku

570,How business operates,      gt not just testing but any role in it requires wearing multiple hats imo  the key is this     gt     gt i began to take an approach to compliment whatever testing we have with some monitoring  alerting and rollback strategies as the best way to reduce impact to customer experience  and this ended up becoming my journey into site reliability in my last 2 companies     gt     gt do anything extra  even once  and that extra thing will become a norm and always be expected of you in the future     gt     gt they will always expect you to do that  hence  never do anything extra  unless it's a small bs thing that can be done in 5 mins  always remember that once you do something extra it'll always be expected of you     gt     gt in your case you tried this monitoring  alerting  rollback stuff which would normally be done by production ops  you took extra responsibility and the result was that it then became a part of your job  this is the rule that got applied     gt     gt do yourself a favor and try to just stick to the job  if needed bring up a recommendation to the management like  i think it'll be great if we can have a dedicated person  who will later become a team  that monitors   alerts   rollbacks stuff   manages production environment  you're still bringing in the value but just not assigning them onto your own head     gt     gt what i'm saying goes directly against the herd thinking so i am expecting a lot of backlashes     gt     gt competent work completion is always rewarded with more responsibilities irrespective of your bandwidth     gt     gt that is why it's better to do a mediocre job and survive long than do a good job and be overwhelmed with work so that you suffer a burn out     gt     gt work completed quickly is almost always seen as a bad thing     gt     gt they see you as cutting corners  so take your time even if you've completed your work  even if you have the skills to finish it pretty fast  stretch out the work so it fills up the whole time but never admit that you're doing this     gt     gt good work will rarely be appreciated     gt     gt if you're someone who has an ocd to get involved in-depth and do a perfect job then you're in for an excruciating time as no one will acknowledge your quality work but instead  they will judge you for calling your own work as being of high quality  people around you will still bring the spotlight on the smallest mistakes even though they can be corrected in seconds  hence  always do as mediocre a job as possible or at least do as much quality work as you're okay with for not being appreciated ,pwqjzf

572,It’s Pointless,it s impossible to save money because everything is so expensive    there is no sense of accomplishment at my job  i come home from office exhausted after 8 hours of mindless bureaucratic paper-pushing that contributes nothing to anything of value    it s harder and harder to eat healthy because everything nutritious is expensive and in chronic low-supply since pandemic  i just eat fast high carb foods and gain weight  lack of proper nutrition is definitely giving my brain fog  i have no energy or enthusiasm to exercise    there is no way i ll ever afford a real house with room for a vegetable garden  something small  just so i don t have to pay high rent to live in a somewhat  safe  but shitty outer suburb    i m past the age where i can have kids  but i was too busy working to go out on dates  so i never had time to meet anyone to marry    my looks are shot because age and stress changed me  worry lines  cheap haircuts  box hair dye to cover the grays that are everywhere  my vision is going and i get aggravated i cannot read without glasses  glasses are expensive  too    i have no future  nothing to look forward to experiencing  i cannot afford a nice fancy trip   and because i have no life partner or kids  i ve discovered that it s even more isolating to go on a trip alone  eating alone in a beach restaurant etc   so why bother  the best i can afford is a crappy motel room where i d have to check for bedbugs upon checkin  so i d rather just stay home    i know if i changed jobs  it will be the same anywhere    dating after 40yo sucks  men my age don t want to date women my age  dating sites where i get  matched  with 60 yo men lying about their age  younger men who send me dm that they re looking for a sugar mama and  prefer older ladies    i just cannot fathom this existence is what i  earned  for working hard  going to school   playing by the societal rules  society is not going to help me when the money runs out and i m not longer capable of working  i tried saving money but had to empty my 401k during the 2008 crash and never really recovered  medical bills  etc    it s all pointless and any shred of financial freedom or independence is a mirage  i just hate staring into this abyss  the black hole ,pwmn1g
573,How do you feel about running your own small business if autonomy is what you are after?,surely the more people who worked towards and opted towards working for themselves the more leverage employees would claim towards employers   i run a small business as well as working  if an employer pissed me off  i quit  and still have an income to get by with  it's spring in australia again and it's feeling like quitting season to move on to another employer for experience    doing both at least until i have my plumbing licence  in which case i'll go full time for myself and never hand in a resume ever again  and i promise  i will treat any future employees better than i've ever been treated by any previous employers ever as something needs to change  may as well start with me   i previously did a science degree and headed off that direction but the lack of autonomy scared me and now i'm a plumber hvac mechanical    i'm doing it purely for my future autonomy  but running a small business just promises so much more than employment  this need to be emphasised,pwuenp

578,What is the point of virtual interviews if the position is not work from home anyways?,i honestly refuse an interview altogether if it is virtual  it's fucking stupid and a waste of everyone's time  all it means is that the manager does not respect you enough to meet face-to-face  especially if you have to work onsite as there is no way you could work from home from certain jobs anyways   could you work from home as a construction worker  here  let me pour some concrete in my office and we'll call that a day   can you perform a customer service transaction from your computer if someone wants to order a cheeseburger  i don't fucking think so   thank you for your order  you will receive your mcnuggets next week   please  employers  we are not buying this bullshit  either meet us face to face and respect us like fucking human beings or we won't work for you at all  why should i prepare an hour and a half or a virtual interview when i can get one done and over with in 10-15 minutes over the phone or just use social distancing and other safety precautions face to face  is it really that god damn hard ,pwx6kk

593,Worst experience just happened with a job,i was hired at a company beginning of sept  and was going through the onboarding process  what was odd from the beginning was it took this company 3 months to even reply to my application through indeed and there was only a phone interview  not a zoom or microsoft teams meeting  i still went through the process  passed the background check and drug test and had a start date  what happens next annoys me but makes me laugh at just the incompetence levels required for this to happen  this job requires driving so i was given a work van  i was asked to pick up the van without filling out my i9 form or w4  which i was told was coming via email as this was a remote position  i was never paid for this time  which required driving about 35 miles to get the van and driving it back to my house  which was about 2 hours worth of  work  i got the van on a saturday and was scheduled to leave the following monday for training in idaho from oregon  only thing is the wrong gas cards were in the van and the tags registration were expired  they had been shipped to the previous employee but never put on the van or sent back to the company  i found this out on my way to idaho  my point of contact with this company had assumed everything was as it should be with the van without actually following through to make sure  so i turned around and headed home  even though this point of contact suggested i could still drive and would only receive a fix it ticket if pulled over  i told him i wasn't comfortable breaking the law for the company and my trip was postponed a week  with nothing to do but read the employee handbook i basically go another week with no pay as they get their shit together  i was wrong  this same point of contact finally tells me i will spend my first week working alone with 0 training  as the trainer he wanted me to work with was in a different location  he also mentioned the store i would be working in has had issues with them in the past and sometimes wouldn't allow them to do what was required because of errors made in the past with in experienced employees making mistakes  i wonder why when you send them in with 0 training  then after this first week with 0 training  i'd be able to drive to idaho for training  this made 0 sense but i said ok  in the back of my mind i was ready to quit as this manager i am working with is obviously an idiot  so today i told the manager for this job i quit  come pick up this piece of shit work van or i'm having it towed  i'm also considering keeping the laptop they're shipping out as severance for not paying me yet expecting me to do work related activities  also just wasting my time in general ,px2fru

605,Can We Talk About This Type of BS?,how do you tell people they're going to be laid off without telling them they're going to be laid off  this self help crap sells millions of dollars a year to fools who believe that if they give 110  they'll earn more money and god knows what else in an increasingly limited job pool  sad   i once worked for a large student loan servicer  it was one of the most eye opening and horrible experiences i had in my working life up to that point  i was hired right after this huge govt  entity just went public on the stock exchange  i had heard how great it was to work for this company and thought i was lucky to be hired  i quickly realized how wrong i was  in one of the orientation meetings i had with the hr dept  head she announced that the company  allowed  us to have a second job but not in certain fields  oh boy i thought  that doesn't bode well  it just went downhill from there  the culture was toxic  they also required tons of over time  month by month since going public they stripped away benefits and made cost cutting measures that included such things as  downsizing  our cubicles to accommodate more people which was kind of a false economy which will be evident soon  i once was given a negative review because i didn't personalize my work space  that is how crazy they were    a year and a half later  there is a company wide meeting which wasn't that unusual  but they were tedious and pointless  my sister worked for the same company and was really good friends with one of the directors so i got the inside scoop on many things  many people worked there because they were related to someone  not great  but i benefitted  you take what you can get  these directors lives were horrible  i heard all the stuff they had to do each quarter because the company wanted them to always be  reaching their potential  they worked 60 to 70 hr  weeks with no overtime as they were executives and not hourly employees  she had to do so much work in the community as well    one of her targets was to give a motivational speech at one of the company wide meetings  this woman decided to give everyone a heads up as to what was coming down the pipeline without telling them what was coming  she decided to give a talk on the book-   who moved my cheese  she used the power point presentation that must also be available for purchase but added her own points which if you read between the lines let everyone know that layoffs were on the horizon  i listened to her presentation and immediately after my friend i was sitting with and i looked at one another and she said-  i guess we should start looking for new jobs  and we burst out laughing  so few people understood that they were soon to be laid off  it was sad  all these people running around in t-shirts the company had given them that had-  we've earned it  written on them  referring to the company's restructuring from a govt  entity to a private corporation funded with tax payer money  a month later the layoffs began  they did it in such a way that everyone was just in fear that one day they would go into work and receive and e-mail asking them to report to hr  i survived the layoffs and was promoted to a different department  my good luck didn't last long  there was an accounting scandal and i was picked to be the fall guy  i refused to fall on my sword for these assh les which made the scandal worse because i could actually prove i had been scapegoated  i knew the writing was on the wall and resigned a month later but i will never forget the humanity that director showed in trying to tip other people off with that corporate self help drivel  she remained with the company  they eventually cut their work force in half and wound up renting out the other half of their building ,pwrvrv

609,People just don't want to work anymore,so my wife quit her job  she is a contractor for various different small businesses  her industry was hit pretty hard by covid and her hours were reduced about 90  from 2019 to 2020  this year  as things pick up again  she reached back out to a number of places and picked up some new contracts    one particular business  that she did some work for 11 years ago didn't mention anything about her rate during the hiring process  but she thought nothing of it since the same thing happened the first time around    so this month  my wife submitted her first invoice to them and when they paid her they also sent an email along the lines of  we think you have made an error in your invoice as we have a different hourly rate in our system  we have adjusted your payment as such  it was a 30  reduction down to her same rate of pay from a decade ago  i called  i'm her accountant business manager  to clarify the situation and have them reissue the correct payment  they refused and also refused to negotiate the rate at all  so my wife called herself and quit  said they can pay her full rate for that month and she won't be back      that business owner  whose  3m house i've been to  has now slandered my wife on socials and posted on her business page how people feel too entitled to high pay  it blows my fucking mind it taking so long for businesses to figure out they don't have the power anymore ,pwssii

620,Fake and urgent deadlines - an excuse to overwork people,these deadlines are all life and death apparently  it's beyond me how people are expected to put imaginary deadlines over their free time  family and wellbeing  like  people are expected to work through lunch  after hours  on the weekend and on their days off to meet these artificial deadlines  and it's not a one time thing    my roommate once worked from 9am -12 am 16hrs  for 3 weeks on a project  including weekends  she got 4 days comp off  during which she was asked to complete the additional work  this is because her company committed to completing the project in 3 weeks without consulting the people doing the work  so she worked for 16 hours a day for nearly a month  there were days where i had to give her food because she didn't have time to make anything   of course she got nothing for it  except getting berated for low quality of work    i understand the people are doing this out of fear  assume they will be fired  or don't have the privilege of being able to quit bad jobs  i don't blame these people  i  blame the assholes taking advantage of them   i have wondered though if the reason for these asinine deadlines is to extract every minute of work from the employee  i live in india  where most people are salaried so people aren't even getting paid extra for this  so companies are getting more work for no extra pay  like in the case of my roommate  they got an extra month's worth of work for free ,px0wwu
621,*slaps table* another one (update),i posted a letter that my managers put up about ot a few days ago and a lot of people said that it was only about to get worse well it did  for me    we all got raises  which helps address the reason why we were all taking overtime  you may be asking yourself  well how is that bad for you  favoritism is how  my  raise  means i make less money    basically  you used to have a choice between getting the health insurance or getting an extra  100 every month  as that's the money our bosses usually spent for their end of the insurance  however  they found a new insurance provider so they're not spending anywhere near  100 every month  idk if the coverage is any less  i didn't take the insurance  and only 4 of us didn't take the insurance  so they decided to do away with the stipend  instead  those of us with the stipend got a raise to make up for it  apparently  they also gave out raises for the extra work we've been doing lately  so while everyone else got  1- 2 raises  i only got 50 cents for my stipend  i usually got  25 week as a stipend  that raise only adds an extra  20 for my pay    they have their reasons  that imo are not valid  to not like me on a personal reason- they dont like that im friends with an ex coworker  i've called them out on their unequal treatment before  i recently had to call out due to an emergency while we were short  it smells of favoritism  because i got a shitty raise while people with less responsibility than me got  2 and now make the same or more than me  this is b s  after all the ot i did that they begged me to take   should i quit   tldr  i got a raise but lost a benefit  so now i make less money while everyone else got significant raises ,pwsf2b

Here are my own.,lets critique otherselves so we can better our agenda  you can't better something without pointing out its flaws and trying to improve it  so i'll throw some on the table to get an idea going but feel free to throw your own as i'm noticing a lot of controversy occuring here   i think that this subreddit provides barely any solutions and mostly post memes and snippets of controversial workplace activity and opinions  jokes are nice and all and i do enjoy a good vent but we need an abundance of solutions or discussions for some as well   another would be that the title of this subreddit itself as it causes mass confusion when first seeing it   you mean you want to be lazy   you mean you want to quit society and move to the wilderness  honestly  if there was a better short-term word to describe what we stand for that wouldn't cause confusion  that would be great  this is a probably the lesser of the critiques but i do see it causing a big effect here   how far is too far  it seems like a lot of us want to push toward widespread social change to better the work environment  which is cool  but we have to know our boundaries  sometimes we have to suffer or cause suffering to exist  you can see the same issues with hardcore vegan-ism for example   eat only plants and drink water  everybody change and if you don't you are supporting the machine and are evil  okay but it ain't that simple to change and is an incredibly complex issue  just like the current working situation  i've also seen a recent post where they were discussing  if not capitalism  then what  which is a valid point but like 85  seemed to want communism  like come on  there has to be a better alternative  we know how badly communism functions  unfortunately though  i don't think you can have an absolutely perfectly government structure  we just have to pick the best one or create a new one out of the lesser evils or the lightest shade of grey we can get it  society is complex  it can't be perfect   i see a lot of people also being unfortunately only for pushing towards changing the world  pushing the agenda of anti-work's beliefs and so on  which is great  however they seem to only be open to blaming the world instead of taking on actions that they can do as an individual  changing yourself is easier than changing the world  changing the world takes a lot more time  so do what you can at the moment   pushing towards individuals changing their own circumstances when asking for solutions of what they can do gets criticised   leave it up to supporting the cause  and  believe in this  i'm sure those beliefs are great but i barely any control in convincing 1 person to do anything  let alone billions  when asking about topics like passive income  whether it be through the form of investing  setting up a digital store  vending machines  renting you can dismantle everything to somehow be wrong in someway  each of these maybe be more valid than another but when does it end  can i not own a vending machine because it means i'm exploiting a factory worker's labour  can i not invest my money into businesses i want to see thrive and that do good in the world  is renting out a place  airbnb  owning a hotel or whatever really deserving of the criticism received here as it helps in our current workplace situation  i think some of the answers to this have to be grey and maybe it should just be up to the individual to decide whether they are crossing a line or not   if you don't agree with any of these points  fair enough but lets hear some valid criticism of this subreddit then ,pwvhxw

709,Nearly 6 years at Domino's and I finally quit,this is going to be a long post probably  i need the catharsis of getting this off my mind    ----  my career at domino's started when i was 19 years old and needed to help my mom pay the rent  it was fun at first  even if i was nervous and shy when i first started  i had opportunities to meet new  sometimes strange  people  learned some new skills  and learned about the area i lived in more thoroughly since i was driving around delivering all night  all in all  it was something i enjoyed at first despite some stressful times of the year when business would spike    at some point i decided it would be a good idea to transition into management  i think traffic and being on the road was starting to stress me out too much  just like driving  working the inside and learning to make the food items was a fun learning experience at first    years go by  people come and go  we cycle through a couple of general managers throughout my time there  some good  some bad  doesn't really matter because they don't affect my day to day shift  too  much  over time  i've grown tired of the place  tired of the annoying or rude customers  tired of the employees and their drama  tired of trying to juggle work  school  a social life  and trying to find an  ounce  of free time outside of all that    then i get an email from domino's  it reads   'congratulations on your 5 year milestone '   the amount of existential dread that hit me after reading that short sentence is indescribable   what am i doing with my life   how did i let it get to this point   what am i still doing here   i'm going to be here my whole life  i think i nearly had a panic attack  and yet i still got dressed and went to work that day    it has been about 9 months since i received that email  from that point i began seriously contemplating what i was doing with my life  and grappling with the idea that i might have to work a job i hate for the rest of my life   not domino's  just in general  i came to realize that the degree i was working towards was just going to put me into another job i would hate  technical writing  writing instruction manuals  writing for a business setting  writing memos or doing editorial work  i was working at a place that made me miserable  making myself even more miserable by going to school at the same time  and working towards making myself miserable for the rest of my life by getting a degree in english with a focus in professional writing    this past year was hell at my domino's  the pandemic boosted our sales big time  our store had the worst staffing it has ever had in a long time and more business than we've ever had  i was the opening manager four to five days out of the week the past year  i worked anywhere from 38 to 45 hours a week during the summer  and for some reason i let the company walk all over me and exploit my labor while quietly seething about it    i woke up at 5am most mornings  rushed off to work to get there at 6am  rushed to do all the prep work - describing just how much work that is would take too long - before we opened  because it was impossible to finish prep during business hours  and there is this toxic idea at domino's where an opening manager can work  1 000  dollars in sales by themselves and still be expected to stay late if prep is not finished  so  i do nearly all the prep before we open  on top of setting up the store  cleaning things that the closing crew did not  counting money  etc  then i deal with  1 000 to  2 000 in sales with one driver - two if i'm lucky - and one other manager  the days inevitably devolved into full order screens  deliveries waiting on racks  customers calling back annoyed  the lobby filled with tourists  no breaks and no time to eat  it was a nightmare  and on top of all that  we were expected to have around 30 items each of prp ready before 5pm   if any of you have ordered domino's before  cheesy bread  parm bites  bread twists  and pan pizzas are all prp  prerush prep  it is all expected to be done  i'm supposing  because the late night managers want all the side items finished before they even get there so their jobs are easier   that all leads me up to yesterday  i woke up around 5 30 am to work on an art assignment for school   i switched my major to creating writing with a minor in art  as soon as i started the timer started before i had to leave for work  two and a half hours  no time to make any decent progress  all i could think about was how much i did not want to go back to that store  there is a festival in town this weekend  yesterday i was scheduled with just one driver until 3pm  just me and one driver  i couldn't bring myself to get dressed  i called my friend and she gave me the push i needed to quit my job with a text    i immediately felt a rush of relief and happiness  nearly 6 years and it was finally over  yeah  i felt bad about quitting through a text message  it was inconsiderate  maybe irresponsible too  but i haven't been treated with even a little consideration from this company for a long time    i bundled up my work shirts and hats  put them in a bag  and threw them in my apartment's trash compactor  then i took a long walk and relished in my newfound freedom    now that i don't have some stupid  meaningless fast food place taking up a lot of my time  i'm free to pursue my dreams of writing and art    the funny thing is that i had requested some time off once summer ended  i told my manager and district manager that i just needed about a month off for mental health and to recharge  burn out was getting to me and i was thinking of quitting  they didn't listen to me  instead they wanted me to train an insider into becoming an opening manager  then  we'll see what happens from there  if they had listened and gave me some time off  i might still be there  i'm glad they did not listen    ----  tl dr  fed up with job over the years  existential break down at 5 year milestone  finally quit after what i can only describe as a summer of abuse and exploitation by both customers and corporate domino's ,pw5dst
710,How do you guys do it?,for the record i really want to because i've become so disillusioned with job-hunting over the last few months and it's destroying my already unstable mental health even more    i don't even know what i'm doing wrong  i did everything i was told to do for my whole life  never missed a deadline  never skipped class  got good grades  picked a field to focus on  went to uni  graduated and now everywhere turns me down before the very first stage normally and then when i get an interview i spend the day preparing and travelling to it before never hearing back after    every job i've applied for has been minimum wage and in a field i've studied for five years straight which came at the hefty cost of mental stability  yet i can't seem to get anything and i don't know what i'm doing wrong at this point  i do have asd but i'd like to think that's not why i'm not being hired  i'm more than socially competent  i can handle an interview well and apart from a few stutters you'd never suspect that i had it    so at this point i feel i'm going to have to eventually bite the bullet and go work a zero hours job at my local mcdonald's or whatever just to make a living and because of my mental health that idea fills me with dread without meaning disrespect  i don't have rich parents nor any connections that can ensure me easy employment and just because of this alone i feel myself and most of the country's population are immediately at a disadvantage    so how do you do it  and how can i do it  as in  how do you afford a living without working in the conventional sense if you understand  in an ideal world i'd drop all this fear and become a successful writer  musician  streamer or whatever and live off the money from that but life's no fairytale so i'm realistic about my prospects    ideally i'd spend my life seeing the world and pursuing my creative interests  but in this world it just seems that it's by-design that most people never end up doing what they really want to and at that point why should we even bother ,pwkmy8

712,Engineering didn't work out as well as I thought it would,so when i was growing up  engineering  was all the rage to push middle highschool students to shoot for during the 00s-10s for their college education   it was marketed as a steady career path for technical minded young people alongside  programming   pharmacy  and  nursing   so i go through middle highschool going to summer programs  taking electives that would help me in college classes later   i join the robotics team  i learn machining  programming  management  gunning to become and engineer because i'm a kid and i'm just anxious about my future   i do well in highschool and get into a  good  engineering college  lucky enough that my parents lived lean their whole lives to put me through college  only child     i make it through college with a ton of technical skills in computing   however  i learn that you can't actually get into an  engineering  job without a licensing process  pe  that involves paying thousands of dollars on additional testing and preparation   on top of this i would have to work under a  professional engineer  for 5 years before i can take another test and finally get my license   it's just too expensive after 4 yrs of college  too hard to find places with pes to work under  and i'm just sick of school  studying  and throwing my parents money away  also i got kicked off of my parent's health insurance so i needed to get a  real job   so i went into commercial construction designing buildings   anyway  i don't really have a plan for the future after all this   i'm really good at my job but i'm already at the  top  of what i can make in this field and it's barely enough to pay for my mortgage  food  and my family's medical bills   and this is all in a  good job  in a  good field  shit is just too expensive these days  so any thought of upwards mobility is a fool's errand   it's the same with a lot of my friends who graduated too  because a lot of them graduated with student debt and most people i knew in college are still living at home or in continued schooling because you just can't do enough to get paid to live these days ,pwg8ui

718,[FOLLOW UP] My company's Halloween traditions...a turn for the worse,so i posted about two weeks ago about my company that has an essentially mandatory halloween costume policy  my resolution was to wear something very  very simple or to maybe even schedule a doctor's appointment and call out that day    the ceo's birthday is coming up  of course  our gift is going to be a collage of each employee in costume doing a ridiculous pose    i just want to maintain my dignity  i don't like costumes  i don't want to wear one at work  and i absolutely do not want to have a picture of me in a costume hanging on the wall for years to come  i make barely enough money to survive here  the workplace is toxic and unfriendly  i want to minimize my misery as much as i can     what do i do ,pwa160

720,My boyfriend's job is making him a shell of a person,my boyfriend works about 60 hours a week at a manual labor job where he only gets one day off each week  since starting the job  i have watched him become a shell of the person he used to be  he is always exhausted and i am lucky to spend a few hours with him every week  he only makes about  15 an hour in exchange for all of his time and energy  most of the people he works with who have been there for years have no social life outside of their families because of their hours  i don't understand why we allow companies to force these kind of hours on people or why people just seem to be okay with being miserable all the time  on top of the horrible hours and less than stellar pay  he constantly watches his coworkers get hurt or comes home himself with scrapes  scratches  etc  and blowing black mucus out of his nose  watching him have to deal with this is killing me  i keep trying to suggest he get a new job  but he wants to stay to gain some more skills at his current job  it's driving me crazy to see him so miserable ,pwi5o0

725,I apologize for the long rant in advance; I am supplying detail information. Look for constructive advice as to how to handle being micromanaged (needing to take meds) and how to deal with incompetent managers?,i am starting to hate my job because of my boss  we only have 2 managers my boss and his idiot counterpart  let's call them beavis and butt-head for this example since i have coworkers could possibly see this posting  with beavis being my direct boss  they over schedule micromanaging the entire day if you are not showing in the phone system they call and want to know why you are not calling or waiting in the que  i set appts for 2 divisions under a parent company both inbound and outbound calls i make  16hr  working from home    they have 2 different programs for scheduling one for paychecks and one for daily tasks  the daily tasks do change every day slightly and to complicate matters i live in one time zone but work in another  somedays i have to work 3hrs before getting a 15 min break to just go to the bathroom  another 2 hours before lunch for an hour after that on tuesday or wednesday 15 min team meeting to reiterate something weird policy change that was already posted in our slack main channel  work another 45 minutes then beavis calls me while on a call  i ignore it and call him back he wants me to verbally confirm i understand what was posted in chat and during the team meeting  i confirm yes  he then says something about my performance to keep working on reaching his daily goal of 30 booked  yes sir  -- don't call me sir  -- work another 45 minutes take 15 minute break   try get something together for dinner  jump back on the phone another hour before done for the day   this last month has been unbearable our industry is in high demand because of covid  each week is something more challenging to make our job more frustrating is added to our plate   first off we have job codes for the divisions if job codes show ex  w-2 or g-2 we are not allowed to book  we have to mark as surplus and an other in-house dept reaches out to them  we have to notify the customer that we don't have availability and that once we do someone will reach out  guarantee the customer will argue and want to speak to the managers  noone is available to assist   then the next week they did a  daily contest  top 3 setters got  30-1st   20-2nd   amp   10-3rd  you could win several times through out the week  employees were booking customers for both divisions so 1 customer counts for 2 appts  without customers consent  noone was notified of the winners numbers and there was no transparency at the rankings of all employees    following week our booking system glitched and any appts we set 2 days ahead only in a certain time zone fell a day behind  good old usa  said it's getting fix before next friday    next week it was here's a service schedule check it before booking since we can't service certain states until nov 11th  oh surprise we fixed the system glitch but customers are calling in pissed that they haven't heard from local department offices since they were booked incorrectly because of the glitch  they want to speak to our managers all of a sudden doug and bill are not available and they are talking through the slack window in private dm  i can see this since both are show from my previous private dms to them both under my recent chats  appt agents trying to get their attention and going unanswered in our main slack channel  mrs  priss  i will post about her another time  says just warm transfer them to local division office   last week we were informed now that we must say   this call may be monitored for quality and training purposes  that phrase exactly ourselves before engaging conversation  like they didn't already hear it when they called in  check service schedules looks  good oops can't job codes show ex  w-2 or g-2 we are not allowed to book  we have to mark as surplus and an other in-house dept reaches out to them  we have to notify the customer that we don't have availability and that once we do someone will reach out  guarantee the customer will argue and want to speak to the managers  of course the both show unavailable at the same time again   i book an appt and double checked all the details got a weird error saying only 4 miles away from local division  informed customer told her i would get her on the schedule and may have to call her back if there's an issue  completed the call was just about to call local division office they called me pure luck  i explained to  sir  that i did get a weird error saying only 4 miles away from local division for the customer and was just about to call them   sir  was cool said we just can't until december 15th no man power or availability  i offered to call customer back and explain 'sir  was like great who's your boss  told him and documented the service ticket what local said and that i informed him that beavis is my boss  left the ticket opened so i could document return customer call info   sir  said he would reach out directly to my boss by email and thanked me for being on my toes about the error message  called the customer back notated that i informed them about the far off date and if they are still interested call local division directly gave the number and saved my notes    couple of days pass and beavis calls me through slack while i am booking an appt  i just ignored the request and called him back when i was done  he asks me to pull up the service request and says do i remember this call  i said yes sir   he says don't call me sir  he says he didn't bother to pull it up himself because of  my great detailed notes  telling me that there's problem with the local office and that he is concerned that i am pulling up offices the wrong way and he has already spoken to me about this before  just berating me about how i am causing him a problem because his name is on the service request under the comments  that 3 people above him are looking at service ticket and mad as can be  finally i get a chance to speak i explained to him that local called got ahold of me that i documented our call  answered  sirs  questions and followed through with the customer as promised  he said don't ever document any of our managers names or say there names to a local office again  he said he had just gotten to the  sirs  email and was being reprimanded by his boss  top dog  for not responding to local  sirs'  since he didn't respond  sirs  reached out to corporate and they went to  top dog  to find out why his employee had yet to respond    so i get the bullshit since he isn't doing his job once again  tells me that he's tired of talking to me and that he is tired of my rebuttals  excuse me  what  they have me working 7-days a week without any days off every other week  he takes off every other weekend but is  on-call  just in case if a tech issue arises but never responds  because our tech dept doesn't work but 1 person each weekend day  our customer service dept doesn't work weekends at all  so we have to fill-in fir them too   when i was hired i was told one weekend a month and mon-fri the rest of the time  there's always a manager to help  book 20 appts a day  as a natural first-born  over achiever aries personality i try to get more than the day before  we would be given our schedules a month ahead  and that we had paid-off all major holidays  they changed that fast to you have to be there 90-days to get the holiday off paid  then next holiday rolls around now its 10 people volunteer then everyone else can have the day off paid  but no time and a half holiday pay would be given unless you had been there over 90-days  what  huh  as of 2 wks ago told if you want a holiday off you need to request asap as they are making the schedules until the end if the year and no longer monthly  you need to request in payroll program and send a detailed email to lucy  will bring her up another time  as to why you need it off  what  huh    apparently beavis will be out of the office for a few days and butt-head is in charge  my questions for you to review and suggest on  should i reach out to  top dog  and let him know that i am being berated by beavis through slack because i was doing my job and constantly am interrupted while on calls  explain to him my side of the local office  sirs  conversation  explain to him that the daily tasks are causing me anxiety  needing to take meds  as i don't work well being micromanaged  that prior to them showing me the daily tasks that i have a record of booking 40 appt a day    i feel under constant threat like beavis is going to fire me  every time he calls me i am like damn what now and my defenses go up  he always gives a back-handed compliment before berating me   at this point i don't give a shit about my productivity out of 40  people i am in the list of the top 10 producers  my personal goal is to double book at least 5 people and get a few extras not exceeding 15 appts a day  that's what is keeping me in the top 10    i expect some people to say that i am lucky to be working and i should appreciate my job to stop whining or i am acting like spoiled brat    please understand i'm 42 yrs old raised in the south with manners beaten in me  child of a hoarder  mom  verbally and physically abuse by my mom and 2 ex-husbands -- which caused my anxiety  its

747,I finally got a good paying job and I quit after 5 months,this is going to be the first time posting in this sub but i've been lurking for quite some time and figured i could find some support here  so as the title playing states  i quit my well paying job with benefits after years of feeling inadequate as a person due to my lack of income  to give some background about myself  i was raised by my mom after my dad died when i was 5 and she instilled the belief that the key to a good life would be to do well in school  she taught me i could be anyone i wanted if i put the work in  you know  classic american dream shit you tell to your kids  i loved my mom  so i listened  but she was never there  having to work 2 jobs to support myself and my two older brothers  so we occasionally got into trouble  as any at risk youths with a single parent would  by the time i did go to college in 2011  i was pretty much a full time hippie  smoking weed religiously and experimenting with a plethora of psychedelic drugs and more  i wanted to prove a point at the time  that i could still get good grades and be smart while being a fucking druggie  i went off to houston and was succeeding at first  deans list both semesters in my freshman and sophomore years while exploring the depths of my mind with acid  mushrooms  2cb  and  peyote  i was not worried about the future  knowing that no matter what  my brain would be able to figure a way out of any situation i found myself in  i had already developed a plain disgust for the  money is god  religious fervor of western culture at this time  having realized we are all one species  floating through space and time on a shared home we call earth  and that we are too busy fighting over pieces of the ground to realize  the existential sadness you feel  knowing that you are contributing to the destruction of your only home by participating in the systematic fuck we call capitalism  was too much to take sometimes  the social pressures of society  the plain fact that if you want to eat you need to pay up  the pleassure of mindless self indulgent behavior to escape the nagging thought you have in the back of your head that you can't help but feel is true in the pit of your soul  that we are all dancing of a cliff  and know one seems to care  drugs right  lol my long time girlfriend informed me in 2013 that she was pregnant and she would be keeping the baby  whoops lol  i loved her and decided the right thing to do would be to finish up school  get a good paying job  and be the dad i never got to have  so i got my degree in 2015 and started the job search  how sad i was to realize that my undergrad degree was pretty much useless and i would either need to attend grad school  which would mean loans and owing a shit ton of money  or get a job that doesn't really use my degree  the first career path i thought of to make money fast to support my family  as my moral obligations required  was sales  i was extremely nieve  and took a door to door sales job that i hated from day one  then got a job as a car salesman for a month  carpet cleaner for another month  etc  i fucking hated having to work with these sales type people  the guys who drink too much  would feel no qualms in their deceitful sales practices  and who expect you to work 10-12 hour days 6-7 days a week  i moved back home and worked different call center jobs  always feeling depressed  feeling like an inadequate husband and father who can't even support his own family  for the past couple of years now  i've been working in life and health insurance sales  and have been with a few different companies but always jumped ship in an attempt to find something that payed more  all this time after college  my wife has been trying her best to finish up her school  but she's getting a degree in art and i'm not sure what job prospects there are in that field tbh  we've definitely had our ups and downs in our relationship due to the economic struggle  the feelings of relative poverty when comparing to peers and neighbors  the embarrassment of having to talk about work with your family because they expect you to be making more and supporting your family  i finally got the good job in april of 2021  great pay  great commission on sales  full health insurance they paid for  pto and sick time  but the stress of 45 hours a week of back to back calls  the pressure to hit your numbers  the constant breathing down your neck  i did great though  i gave it my all  i was making  3000 checks after taxes every 2 weeks  but i was depressed  i was drinking every other day  i drank coffee just to wake up  but it gave me anxiety  i wasn't paying attention to my now 7 year old son  who is struggling in school and had to be held back this year due to falling behind during the lock down  and above all  i felt like the job itself  selling medicare advantge plans  was pointless when you believe healthcare should be a human right  why was i spending what fleeting time i have left on this planet exacerbating the existential problems we face as a species  so i can support my family  i feel like that's how the system tricked me  played off my love of family so i can be a willing employee  willing to sacrifice whatever it took so that they knew i loved them  i snapped last week and almost broke down  i took the week off and spent time with my wife and son  i told myself i would think it over  and i decided i quit  with no plan in place  because life is too short to be wasted on dreams implanted by false programming or propaganda  so yeah i needed to vent  i feel like i'm making a huge mistake  but at the same time i feel a sense of power  i'm not letting my western cultural programming deem myself lazy  inadequate  and a failure any longer  i figure i'll find simple part time work  just enough to get by  and work on writing my stories  now i just need to tell my wife lol  thanks for reading  best of luck to everyone here  sorry if i got off topic for a bit  just figured some background would help ,pwkrni

758,From Hardworking To... I Want Out!,so i see these random posts here from the  hardworking  people claiming it's all lazy and the ones who never worked a day in life posting here  well  let me tell you about that   i graduated in civil engineering almost 20 yrs ago and it's the stuff i really love  i like technical challenges and it was so fulfilling starting my career on some massive infrastructure projects  i was a green noob hungry for knowledge and full of passion about my work  i was the one who stayed late at night not because someone asked me to  and of course they did  i wanted to know more  to get better  it was not about career progress at all  it was literally about getting better in engineering and knowing more about advanced calculus i was interested in   that was 20 yrs ago  today i am a design manager who's questioning his career choice and every day looking to get out of this filthy corporate man eating machine that is run by the most incompetent amongst us    after few years  the noob wanna-know-it-all person was slowly being transformed in to a bitter overworked drone  you see  one would think engineering is about inventing new things and making stuff more advanced and better  well it's nothing like that  engineering is about making things cheaper within the  competitive  budget available for the project which is then cut by first line of managers to look good in front of the ceo  and the subsequently cut by every other manager down the line  until you're left with crumbs to deliver something that's been built once in 100 years  everyone is overworked to the point of collapse  overtime is like standard in every engineering office  nobody even questions how hr walks away from the office at 5pm like a clockwork while we stay late in to the night because it's a project submission day  and every week there is another submission  and then on to the next one  there is no time to discuss  only time to patch up and submit the next deliverable    then you become a family and that engineer salary won't cut it anymore  where do you go then  must go up the manager level and if you don't want it you will be segregated and treated as a weirdo   hey he's 20 yrs here but only an engineer  what a looser  this is where the true grind begins because to be a successful manager in this profession  you need to be a psychopathic  emotionless and ruthless asshole  which is something i'm not  and you guessed it  i'm not very good at being manager  i worry about people who work for me  i genuinely feel bad when we do overtime and i must order it  i spent sleepless nights worrying about letting people go if we don't get the next project bid  it's pressure beyond imaginable and i'm looking for way out  i get shouted at by middle managers and directors every day  i'm not meeting targets  i'm being too nice  i'm not delivering  i haven't seen my kids grow up as i spent most of my days in office  i feel like the guy from  cats in the cradle  song  that's my life   so  fuck corporate and office environment  fuck the useless non technical managers who took over our profession and made it so unlivable and constant grind  fuck the governments for always being broke and looking for another cheaper unreliable low quality solution  everything is cheaper  from our solutions to our wages  if anyone dares to tell you you're laze because you don't want your life to be destroyed by this monster  tell them to fuck off ,pw67pj

816,question for all workers at a small business,ok so i work at a small breakfast restaurant three days a week for six hours  8am-2pm  for about a month now and i've noticed that i don't get a 10 minute break only a 30 minute unpaid lunch  i find that weird because i've worked at other places for as short as 4 hours and still got a small break    yesterday i asked to go to the bathroom and was told that i have to clock out for my break to use the bathroom  i should mention i almost never go to the bathroom during my shift except right before i clock in or right after lunch  i thought that was weird since i have never had to clock out just to go to the bathroom for any other job i worked at even when i worked at target or mcdonald's    has anyone else had to deal with this  this was told me by the owner directly  is this even legal  can they do this  i've only just started working here but i feel like i should report this if it isn't because i have never experienced this at any job even at a telemarketing job where the bathroom was broken and i had to go to another building to go to the bathroom    i know it's only for six hours but i still think i deserve a ten minute break or even a five minute break  i would hate to get fired but this doesn't seem right at all  i know it gets busy but i think i deserve a breather at some point    thanks in advance,pvv98b

819,sorry if not allowed,tldr is it wrong to want to work hard and do your best  how do we survive in a job market that incentives doing the bare minimum but requires us to sell our souls   i come from a background of hard workers  my great grandfather lost his lung working on coal powered trains  my great grandmother his wife  had to take the bus 45 minutes away at the dead of night to make it to work  my grandfather  a mexican immigrant  and father gave their blood sweat and tears to help build and maintain our nations highways and as far i remember my mom has never taken a sick day and only vacations maybe every 5 years   now that i m in the workforce i wish to follow their example  work hard  go above and beyond and be truly exemplary  so  if i m on the clock  i m surely to be doing the best that i can    i realize this probably isn t the sub for someone like me but the general idea i get from this group is that working and making a living isn t wrong  what s wrong is the foundations of said jobs careers and how they treat us as disposables   am i correct in assuming this    if so  is there anything we can do  anything i can do  i work retail and it feels like at times these so called managers run around like headless chickens when it comes to getting anything of permanence done  so many issues and logistics back firing and it seems each is an easy fix  can t keep them  treat them like human beings  can t hire them  offer them pay they won t want to refuse  no more of this  up to  bullshit  everyone is calling out  start scheduling them right  i really just don t get it,pvny1x

822,Resigned to go for a dream.,so i resigned from my job last week  my family  of course  had a mild freak out that i'd not find anything better  decided i wanted to chase a dream  i want to be a nurse  and applied to a local hospital for positions only needing a h s  diploma to get my foot in the door  had one interview a day later but didn't win out over a guy more qualified  congrats to them  however  4 hours later got a request from the same hospital wanting to video interview with me for a much better paying position that could set me up to make a good living  fingers crossed  they also noted paying extra  per hour if you work weekends at all  only asked to work week days  7am to 3pm  with paid lunch  and if you work any calendar holiday   yes  i don't have a job there yet but i'm already looking into college to get a degree and despite not currently working  for the first time in my life i feel like i have control and can set myself up to chase this dream i never thought i'd reach coming from a poor family  resigning to do my own thing and go for what i want has been the best career choice of my life after busting my butt doing a manager's job in retail making only peanuts    i just want to say  lurking here made me have the strength to peace out and go for what i really want  so  thank you   ,pvrqkk

824,Throwaway - Hate my new job,3 weeks ago i left my job of 8 years at a major bank  i hated it  i worked my butt off the first 2 years to try and work my way up to an administrative position  i cross-trained as many functions as i could to make sure i would be the sure pick  well  i got the administrative position and thought that would be the end of my manual labor career and i could eventually move up into management  after all  no other person in those positions worked in the actual operation  well  i hadn't even finished training for my new job before they started throwing me back in the operation any time someone was on vacation or out sick  i expressed my displeasure with this and was told i was not being a team player  i was continually put in the operation while my coworker enjoyed their cushy desk job  after 5 years  i supervisor position over the operation opened up and i applied but didn't get it     i decided to start looking elsewhere  i found a supervisor position with another large bank  applied  and got the job  it pays about  7k less per year but still plenty to pay the bills and put into retirement  but  i think  thought  there's be more opportunities to advance since i have a supervisor title  i've been there one week and i'm done  the culture there is like high school and everyone is constantly trying to get each other in trouble  they especially try to get us in management in trouble because all of us were outside hires  the managers told me on my third day that i was  in for a rough ride  because of this  most of the employees waste a ton of time and i'm stuck there until 5 00-5 30 in the evenings because they're milking the clock for overtime when they could realistically be done around 4 30  i was told in my interview that they were usually out between 4 00-4 30  come to find out  they've  other managers  been trying to get them to cut out the overtime and leave around then  but haven't been able to  they hired me to try and take a crack at it  i'm not really keen on the idea of coming in with the expectations of fixing everything     anyway  i'm really considering just taking the  100k from my first job 401k and starting my own business  the problem is i have no idea what and health insurance is absurdly expensive  myself family  i don't really have a question  i just need to rant to someone  i don't want to let my partner know this because they were already resistant to me leaving the first job in the first place ,pvip3h

829,I'm rooting for each and every one of you.,i've just now stumbled upon this sub in r all and i am so glad that this sub exists  because i agree with so much of the stuff being shared here  the norms of a 40 hour work week is absolutely terrible   coming from someone who has done both worked the 9-5 for a few years and has escaped  i can say that doing your own work on your terms  when done correctly  is the greatest thing in the world  some people out there will tell you  working for yourself is so hard and stressful  i wish i had a job  but those people are just focusing on the negative and not realizing what they don't have to deal with anymore from the 9-5   this post is not meant to be a brag at all but more so of coming from a position of expressing that i've been where you are now  somehow i managed to escape  and i really hope you are able to as well   by the way  this is my anonymous account in which i rarely post about what i do for a living to hide my identity  so don't expect to see anything like this in my post history for this account   right out of college  i got a job in the career i studied  i didn't mind the work  but i hated the lack of time  freedom  and energy more than anything  not to mention  i had a ton of student loan debt that was hard to keep paying off  so i was living at home with my parents as well  i have no idea how anyone making as much as i was could afford rent anywhere  i was taking home about  2 000 every month  student loans were a few hundred a month  gas  car payment  cell phone  food  and there is literally no way i could afford  500-700 for rent    at the rate i was at  it would have taken me like 20 years to pay off my student loans  and not to mention how the hell i would be able to afford my own place  furniture  appliances  and all of that needed to move   the job robbed me of my time  i got off work at 5  took a 20 minute drive home  went home to cook dinner and prepare tomorrow's lunch at work  it's 6 o'clock  then i got to be asleep by about 9 or 10 because i wake up at 5am to go to the gym before work   the job robbed me of my energy  all the time i had off work was just used to recover mentally and physically  just so i could go back and do it all over again   one day  i had enough of it  i was building a side gig of my own and although it was very early in its infancy stage  i had to take the risk   the final straw for me was that my boss said we weren't allowed to listen to music in our headphones while we work anymore  building up to that  literally every week there was a new rule or restriction to our work that made things even more miserable than the last week   the last good news i did get was a couple of months before putting in my two weeks  i was given a raise  i think it was only like an extra  100 month  but i was already checked out by then  and i actually felt nothing  i honestly feel like they could have given me a  1 000 month raise and i would still have been as miserable and as stuck as i was   fast forward to now   i am living my dream life in terms of work  won't go into specifics but i'll just call it a  side gig  online freelance work  i make my own schedule  i get to sleep in every single day  i can do whatever i want when i want  there hasn't been a week where i've worked more than 25-ish hours with this gig  and i make much more money than i did at my job  i make like 4 to 6x as much money in some months working half the hours  when you calculate my hourly pay  it's about 6-10x in some months   if you are in a situation where you feel stuck in your job  i promise you there is a way out  you may never figure it out  but i swear everyone can do it if they have the passion for whatever it is they want to do and they are creative enough to turn it into an actual source of income  it won't fall into your lap  you have to go out and get it  try  fail  try  fail  succeed  grow  escape the 9-5   there are so many things that i could complain about the traditional 40 hour work week  but i will highlight just a few from the perspective of being out of it and realizing how terrible it is to live that way   you can't use your phone   most jobs don't allow you to use your phone while you're on the clock or whatever  getting in trouble for watching youtube or playing a game  the phone that you are paying for every month  you can't even use it all the time   you are at work more than home   pay for a house or rent an apartment just to only be there 3 waking hours a day  it's so terrible to be at work just so you can afford to live in a house that you are barely even at   all of your impulse decisions are based around your work schedule   if you have the impulse to stop everything you're doing and go buy a new tv  you better hope you don't have this impulse at 2pm on a tuesday or at 10am on a friday  because you can't just pause everything you're doing and go do it because that time is owed to your job  you don't own your weekday afternoons  you have to ask for permission and it has to be important enough deemed by your work's standards to allow you to take that time off  now  if you have this impulse decision at 6pm on a monday  you better hurry up and get to the store before you have to be in bed so you're rested enough for work the next day   being a few minutes late is the end of the world   this literally does not make any sense why this is such a big deal at a job  if you pull into your work parking spot right on time  you better not sit and mentally rest for 5 minutes or you'll be late and in trouble  but god forbid  if your manager wants to take a 20 minute poop after lunch that's totally acceptable   if you have trouble falling asleep one night  too bad   there are no jobs that i know of that will let you sleep in for a couple of hours if you were tossing and turning at night  they don't give a damn  be at work right at 8 o'clock  if you do call in and arrange it to where you come in later in the morning  then you'll have to use your vacation time and this will be considered a penalty to your sick days  my old job would only allow us to call in sick twice a month or you get written up   end rant   time for the positive side of where i am at now   now  i can go out of town whenever i want   there have been a handful of times where i have taken impulse trips out of town  cleared my schedule  arranged my work around my enjoyment and made it happen    i don't mind being stuck in traffic   my work only requires 20-30 hours of work a week  i have plenty of time to get where i need to be  if i'm a few minutes later than expect to my destination  it does not matter   i take action based on how i feel   when i had a job  95  of the stuff that i wanted to do i couldn't do it ever  i had to be at work at the same time  i had to eat at the same time  i had to go home at the same time  i had to go to sleep at the same time  now if i feel like staying up until 2am to watch south park episodes i can do it  if i feel like walking around at the mall on a tuesday afternoon  i can do that  very rarely do i ever say to myself  i wish i could do this right now  because i just do it   i can wear whatever i want  wearing a uniform or tucking in my shirt was such an annoying feeling  now i work in the most comfortable clothes  most of the time at home without shoes or socks on    there's so much more i can list off here as well   all of you who are feeling stuck in your 9 to 5  you feel like you don't have the time  money  or energy to be happy  i promise you there is a way out  the opportunity is there with the internet  cell phones  social media  and technology  only the people who take the right action and don't give up can escape   let me know if anyone needs to talk  i know how stressful work and life can be and it really really sucks and working 40 hours a week is so stupid   good luck to everyone out there trying to escape ,pvnicw

846,The sleezy life of working a New Car Dealership,i started a job in early 2020 at one of the highest volume ford dealerships in michigan  i was in a tough spot after being let go from another crap job less than a week before christmas in 2019    i finally got this job as a porter at this ford dealership  less than a month later we got hit with the stay at home order and got laid off for 2 months   when i came back i was pretty  nose to the grindstone   kind of worker  i avoided going into the dealership if i could   i saw most of the porters before me leave and watched everyone who got hired leave as well    there were two types of porters  sales porters and service porters  i was a sales porter and was part of the inventory department   my direct manager was the inventory manager but above him were the sales managers  let me stress that the inventory manager was one of the best bosses i ever had  however his powers over my employment were very limited  raises  pto  and everything like that had to be approved by the sales managers  all the other porters left due to the pay being an absolute joke considering our work had us exposed to the elements and the consistent pissy comments from management for things not getting done when they always pulled us from jobs to do something the sales team can easily do themselves   now that we are done with introductions let's get to why you're here  after most of the porters quit there was a total of 4 of us left in our department  2 porters and manager and assistant manager  around april of this year the world was hit with the  chip  shortage   look it up if you are unaware of the significance of this  with the shortage of chips came a huge inventory shortage as well   with very little inventory i spent most of my time in the dealership doing whatever was needed  being inside the dealership i would over hear a lot and talked with the sales team more and it was eye opening  ford closed up ordering units for stock due to the huge shortage and cars could only be ordered for customers specifically  even with this being an issue the dealership was still making close to record profits  the gm was not silent about this  he would brag about it to anyone who would listen  even after getting a dollar raise it still wasn't bringing in enough  i would still be sitting at my starting pay if my direct manager didn't go to bat for me as he knew i was busting my ass day in and day out    the sales managers required all sales to have an extra 2k slapped on the back end of every deal which greatly helped their near record profits  most salesman were also practicing something called  packing the deal   which was essentially overstating the monthly payment and convince them to buy a car at an inflated price  this was against company policy but management actually teaches them how to do it and get away with it as the dealership also gets some of that money too  not everyone does it but it's pretty common practice to rip off customers   if that wasn't bad enough  management and our new corporate had a brilliant idea to recoup stock before anyone else  they were still restricted by the  retail orders only   that i mentioned above  the dealership started using customer information to put in fake retail orders  when the car comes in they will just say  customer didn't want it  and slap it in stock  they pulled out old customer info and even forged customer signatures using the cursive font of the computer  i saw sales managers doing this left and right  they did this over 1000 times   not an exaggeration    it always kept going deeper  i saw them fire a woman  in financing because they found a hotter younger girl to do her job  no explanation just fired her in the middle of meeting   the high volume sales people would also get assistants who are basically someone to work with customers so you can double up on customers  they will pawn off most of their work in underpaid guys and get barley any of the commission  assistants quitting was very common as some of the salesman were just absolutely horrible people  some worked to rip off customers more than others   i could bore you with everything but that would take all day and i'd be surprised if you have read this far into it   i'm no longer with the company as all of these things made me not want to be part of this company   a week after i left i saw them hiring for my old position for 2 dollars more than what i made after close to two years with them    let me leave you with this  my job had me visit many dealerships and the shady nature is universal   do not trust salesman  it's their job to make you feel comfortable and let your guard down  they are definitely looking to squeeze every cent out of you  buying brand new cars is a terrible investment  buy used always  you will not get your money's worth out of any new car  every good review you see on a sales person is from some poor soul who got talked into bed with no lube   don't tell your sales person youre gonna go shop for a better deal on a new car  they know the minimum the car can go for and they know you aren't fooling anyone  they know you're bluffing and that deal will only go up the next time you come back because they know you exhausted your options ,pvzh05
847,Having trouble understanding anti-work mindset.,first just want to emphasize  i'm not trying to troll or call anyone lazy  i'm just looking to understand this perspective on work   the main question i have is as follows   if     every human requires basic necessities to survive  food  water  etc    it takes work to produce basic necessities  is there any reason why a human shouldn't have to work to produce those necessities  or produce things of equal value to trade for those necessities  to survive  given those two facts  is it any wonder work is a universal part of life ,pvmwvw

865,I refused a ‘promotion’,posting this from a throwaway account   for some context  i work a unionized job at a fortune 500 company  where i m paid hourly  i get paid double time and a half for stat holidays  vacation  and my pay is reflected by the number of hours i work  including overtime if offered  in this position we work 5 8 hour shifts per week  with two guaranteed days off   in may  i was approached by the general manager  and asked to work a non union management position due to staffing shortages temporarily  he told me for the sake of simplicity they would continue to pay me my hourly rate  and i should just enter my time worked as i did in my old position  after i checked with the union it was okay to do something like this  i agreed for the sake of helping out and trying something new   i found out quickly that i was not a fan of the job  and that there were some stark differences in the schedule    - the schedule is rotating  4 on 3 off  or rather it s supposed to be that way  but i ve had to work a few 6 or 7 shift straight  - the shifts were originally 10 hour days instead of 8  again not so bad  2 hours of overtime every day is nice  - on the 13th  everyone in the team i m working with has been mandated to work 12 hour shifts  and for the existing salaried employees  there was no pay raise    2 weeks ago  i got a phone call from my manager telling me he had a job offer for the position i was working  looking to make it a permanent arrangement  almost immediately i said no  simply based on the fact i knew it would be salary  however he insisted i at least read the offer before i gave an answer  looking at the contract  it was a salaried position  with a stipulation on the salary offer citing  this salary consists of payment for all hours which you may be required to work in the performance of your role  which loosely translates to unpaid overtime  bearing in mind the salaried employees are entitled to a bonus based off both the company and their performance  after running the numbers based on an average bonus  it comes out to around  12 000 less than i make without working any overtime  after reading the offer  i once again declined   not long after i was called into the general manager s office  and was given an hour long lecture about how i m closing a lot of doors and leaving a lot of opportunities on the table for future management positions if i say no  i just told them regardless of the potential for promotions  i told him i saw very little value in taking home over  10 000 less and working an average of 40 hours more per month  their justification for the pay cut being that my job title is the highest paid unionized position in the company  and we do get paid very well  so it s hard to offer a competitive wage for an entry level management position  he kept telling me  the money will come  sometimes you need to make sacrifices and make yourself more marketable within the company    i was also not a very big fan of the carrot and stick approach of  take the job offer and see where your career goes  or return to your unionized position and a lot of doors will start closing for you here ,pvq4e5

905,Director says money doesn't solve anyone's problems,this happened a couple of months ago at a job i have since left  so i work in healthcare at a hospital where we were hemorrhaging healthcare workers left and right  morale was low  everyone was bitter about work  people were actively looking at other jobs  managers were constantly asking for volunteers for overtime  we were critically understaffed  no one was getting additional compensation for the extra work they did  people couldn't use their pto without approval and almost no pto was approved  we had a department meeting where our director and all three of our managers finally showed up  i had a list of questions and points to make like how did they plan to address our staffing shortage in the short term and long term  how did they plan on retaining the little staff they did have left  how did they plan on addressing the holes in the schedule if no one volunteered to cover  was there any option for ot bonuses or retention bonuses to incentivize people to work those ot shifts and actually stay here without losing more employees  our brilliant mediocre director said   i have no ideas about how to handle the staffing shortage or the schedule but if you all have ideas then please tell one of the managers  and with regards to bonus pays  the 1 5 pay for regular ot should be incentive enough and more money won't solve anyone's problems  people will be happy for a bit with more money  but when that runs out then we're back where we started  so bonuses are off the table  oh and did i mention for that meeting  instead of morale pizza  the director brought in day-old pastries from the gas station he gets coffee at in the mornings  happy to say i moved on but some of my old coworkers who are still there have texted me saying it's only gotten worse  there are over 14 job openings in the department for a  lt 200 bed hospital  one of my old coworkers who has been there for 35  years is working insane amounts of ot  her pto accrual has capped out and she's literally losing money by working  and when she brought it up to the manager about losing her pto  the manager said she's historically used all her pto before  to which she responded   you mean when i was paralyzed in the hospital  yea  so  fuck that ,pvvh3p

915,Heinrich Böll's Story about the Lowering of Productivity, i just transcribed the pdf    amp x200b   to work or not to work  in a port on the western coast of europe  a man  wearing shabby clothes  lies in his fishing boat and dozes  a smartly dressed tourist is just putting a new colour film into his camera to take a picture of the idyllic scene  blue sky  green sea with peaceful  snow-white crests of waves  black boat  the fisherman's red cap  click  and again  click  and as all good things come in threes  and as it's better to be on the safe side  click  for the third time  the dry and almost hostile sound wakes the dozing fisherman  who sleepily sits up  sleepily reaches for his cigarette-packet  but before he finds what he is looking for  the eager tourist already holds out a packet right under his nose  putting the cigarette not exactly into his mouth but placing it into his hand  and a fourth click  that of the lighter  finishes off the zealous civility  this hardly measurable  and never verifiable  excess of rash civility produces an irritably embarrassing situation which the tourist  who speaks the language of the country  tries to bridge by starting a conversation   'you will make a good catch  today '  the fisherman shakes his head     but i was told the weather is favourable '  the fisherman nods    'so you won't put to sea '   the fisherman shakes his head  the tourist gets increasingly nervous  to be sure  he is deeply concerned about the welfare of the man in shabby clothes  and sadly frets over the missed opportunity   'oh  you don't feel well '  eventually  the fisherman switches from sign language to the actually spoken word  'i feel splendid ' he says   i never felt better ' he stands up  has a good stretch  as if he wanted to show off the athletic shape of his body  'i feel great '  the facial expression of the tourist grows more and more unhappy  no longer can he suppress the question which  as it were  threatens to burst his heart   but why  then  do you not put to sea   the answer comes promptly and briefly  'because i already put to sea this morning '  'did you make a good catch '   my catch was so good that i need not put to sea for a second time  i had four lobsters in my baskets  caught nearly two dozen mackerel '  the fisherman  finally awake  is now thawing  and slaps the tourist soothingly on the shoulder  the worried countenance of the latter seems to him an expression of inappropriate  yet touching  anxiety   'i have enough even for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow ' he says to relieve the stranger's soul  'do you want a cigarette '   'yes  please '  cigarettes are being put into mouths  a fifth click  the stranger  shaking his head  sits down on the rim of the boat  and puts down the camera  for now he needs both hands to give his speech emphasis    'i do not want to meddle in your personal affairs ' he says  'but just imagine  you put to sea today for a second  a third  or perhaps even a fourth time  and you catch three  four  five  maybe even ten dozen mackerel  just imagine that '  the fisherman nods   'you put to sea ' continues the tourist  'not only today but tomorrow and the day after tomorrow  indeed  on every favourable day two  three  or perhaps four times - do you know what would happen '  the fisherman shakes his head   'in one year at the latest you would be able to buy a motor  in two years a second boat  in three or four years you may  perhaps  have a small trawler  with two boats or the trawler you would  of course  catch a lot more - one day  you would have two trawlers  you would ' for a few moments his enthusiasm leaves him speechless  you would build a small cold store  perhaps a smoke-house  soon afterwards a marinating factory  fly around with your own helicopter  making out the shoals of fish and giving orders to your trawlers by radio  you could buy the fishing rights for salmon  open a fish restaurant  export lobster directly to paris without a middleman - and then ' once again his enthusiasm leaves the stranger speechless  shaking his head  saddened in the depth of his heart  and almost bereft of his holiday delights  he looks on the waters rolling peacefully into the harbour  where the uncaught fish jump merrily   'and then ' says he  but again his excitement leaves him speechless  the fisherman slaps him on the back  as one would slap a child choking over his food   what then ' he asks in a low voice   'then ' says the stranger with quiet enthusiasm  then you may relax here in the harbour with your mind set at ease  doze in the sunshine - and look out on the magnificent sea '   but that is what i am doing just now ' says the fisherman  'i relax here in the harbour with my mind set at ease  and doze  only the clicking noise of your camera disturbed me '   in fact  the tourist  thus put right  became thoughtful and went away  for he used to think he worked in order that  one day  he need not work any more  and there remained in him not a trace of pity for the fisherman in shabby clothes  only a little envy ,pvpo47

922,How to protect your mental health?,i've started noticing my peers  who entered the workforce a few years before me  because i fucked up big time at uni but offtopic  just  decline over the years  like  they feel smaller and more neurotic  in the sense that they don't have the enthusiasm and intellectual prowress of their teen years  and they feel kind of mentally confined to just whatever is the immediate concern of their daily life  they're more jittery or talk repeptatively about the same small thing  i don't want to become like that  just crushed by life  i've already noticed the start of that decline in myself  and i'm not sure how to protect my health ,pvk9e5

926,Can someone direct me to a source that can help me explain my anti-work support to my family?,they are the kind of people that worked pretty hard for what they have and are solidly middle-class  and because they were successful in what they attempted  they think that everyone else should be able to be as well  if you don t have any money or don t want to work   you re lazy  and they are somehow offended when i bring up that fact that everyone s experience is different  like they think i m trying to deny that worked hard    it s challenging for me to articulate my thoughts to them  so any help is appreciated,pviy7c

930,Theirs a difference between working overtime for yourself and for a company,just a little thought experiment i wanted to share  i have sworn off working more than 40 hours a week for just one company  the company i work for now doesn t really require me to up my hours as i can get my work done in less than 8 hours  i also have a side hustle than i do on the weekends and a few weeks days just to take care of some of my bills besides rent  i would never work over 50 hours a week for a company because my roi is gonna be shit for that  not much added benefit outside of the company making more money of course  but i do plan on starting an online business where i m gonna be working my normal job and working on the side business off hours and weekends  i m gonna be easily clocking in over 60 hours of total work time but only 40 of that goes to the company and the other 20 or more hours goes directly reinvested back into me  eventually i ll be able to have it up and running where i can quit my day job and focus full time on my business where again i would still hope to work under 50 hours a week  i guess my point is i m gonna have to sacrifice a lot of time to accomplish my goals and dreams but that s ok if i m reinvesting all my time back into myself and not to make some other cocksucker rich  i think it s totally ok to work a lot of hours if you are seeing the full return on investment  even then you should probably find a business plan that allows you to somewhat automate a lot of things and have more free time in the end  online businesses cut out a lot of middle man bullshit and you can limit employees if not completely eliminate them  i only plan on having a few people do contract work for me at some point  it wouldn t be a full time salary position  i would never start a physical business in today s day and age  moral of the story your time is limited here always find ways to reinvest in yourself not someone else ,pvu916

935,Quitting for my mental health.,hi everyone  my first time posting here  i ve been at my job for 6 months now and recently had a mental breakdown  i work in a medical setting and have seen old folks with dementia being mistreated by other staff  i m very empathetic and so it s taken a toll  ive reported things and management doesn t care  they told me that occupancy is going to double before the end of the year but more people won t be hired    i ve been sick for a week with a non-covid illness and i was out of work for a week  management has texted me showing no remorse for me being okay  only asking when i ll be back  i am 99  sure i m leaving without notice to preserve my mental health  it sucks because i make okay money  but contributing to an organization that shakes my moral compass is not good for me    my two concerns are leaving the patients  amp  not being able to use this job as a reference   otherwise i know it s the right choice  any advice on how to handle this would be appreciated  thanks ,pviqqr
936,I had a massage and it really made a difference.,basically  treat yourself  i'm between jobs at the moment and a great friend treated me to the treatment  but oh my god was it great   i was  probably guess i am  skilled labor and work on my feet with my hands  if you do similar work  i'd highly recommend an hour or half hour of getting  your feet  hands  and shoulders done  it may not be a raise  but it'll sure raise your spirits   i think taking care of yourself after the rigors of work can help you realize what you're actually worth  so go out and give yourself a little break even if your boss doesn't and have a good think about who you are and bring to the table while you're on the table   fight on  brothers and sisters ,pv4sjl

938,My anti work story,i just stumbled on this sub and it s great  i thought i d take a moment to share my own anti work story with you all and how i  sort of  rose above all the toxic bullshit    in june of 2015 at the age of 29 i began working for the usps as a city carrier assistant  it s the absolute worst professional experience i ve had in my life  things began pretty rough  like any new job  but i stuck with it and became good at it  too good  within months i was given absolutely ridiculous workloads  sometimes two full mail routes a day  7 days a week  week after week and month after month  fast forward to the next summer  we re short handed and i ve worked 90  days straight  i lost count  i asked the postmaster for a day off because i m exhausted  she begins to chuckle  you re the office bitch  after that exchange i thought to myself  ok  i m supposed to get a full time spot in two months  i ve stuck it out for a year i can do two more months no problem   two months go by and mere days before i m to be awarded a full time spot with benefits i m told they  management  screwed up seniority and the lazy asshole who called in sick every other week will be getting the spot instead  i m furious but no business near me pays as well as the post office so i continue to stick it out    several more months go by and we re rolling into december  it s crunch time  everyone is pissed and overworked by the non-stop flow of holiday parcel volume  it s early morning and i m preparing my route for the day but something is wrong  i m experiencing so much pain in my groin i begin to feel nauseous and i begin to wonder how it will be possible for me to deliver my 16 mile walking route  i express my concern to my supervisor to which he replies  go to the bathroom and throw up  you ll feel better  i went back to work for 20 minutes before i returned to his desk   this is bullshit  i m going home  use some of my vacation time to cover my hours i m going home sick  i went home and took some ibuprofen and a nap  woke up several hours later still in pain  from there i went to the er where after several hours i learned i had cancer  it was everywhere and my body was lit up like a christmas tree in the ct scans  i call work the next morning and explain i won t be back until i figure out what the next steps are as i ve been prescribed heavy painkillers    5 months later i m back at work  i ve been through enough chemo where my tumors have shrunk and i kicked the painkillers however i ve still got 4 months of chemo followed by 6 months of recovery  this doesn t sit well as i need a lot of time off for treatments and other doctor visits  they were also expecting the same 70 hour a week wage slave so it shouldn t be surprising that i met resistance when i presented management a doctors restriction for 40 hours a week  i d be thrilled if i had an employee with stage 4 cancer that was still willing to put in full time hours even though they weren t receiving full time benefits   2 years later i m still considered part time  cancer is gone and i m still working far more hours than the full time regulars that receive full benefits  i go back to the postmasters office to make my case only this time i have an ace up my sleeve  i sit down and tell her  i ve been here nearly 5 years  the amount of work i do justifies the creation of a new full time position at this office  if you re unwilling to create that new position then i will have no choice but to bid on full time positions outside this office as i m now eligible to do so  she declined    that was her mistake  she thought i was bluffing  within two months she had multiple requests for my employee file from other offices   in the end i chose a full time position at the post office in the next city over  it wasn t a carrier position  in fact i don t touch the mail at all anymore  i became a custodian which is generally a position saved for disabled vets   now i m guaranteed 40 hours a week  no mandatory overtime  full benefits and pension  union support and best of all there is legitimately only 3 hours of work for me to do and i get 8 hours to do it  so while i m still at the bottom i was able to rise above and get the hell out of that toxic office and unreasonable workload  i have my life back  i have enough time left over every day that i m able to spend the afternoons and evening fishing  kayaking  hiking  or just be a couch potato if i want   i know most of us won t become rich  so i wish the best for all of you and genuinely hope that you can find yourself a golden parachute career like i have ,pv7ds3

I want it to be seen,strap in for a wall of text   i have struggled with trauma and adhd my whole life  when i was in 5th grade i tried to kill myself and it was all down hill from there    when i was in high school my mother was very sick  lost her job  and i thought my step dad would leave because of it  i thought i would have to work and provide for my mother   if she survived  while i could barely handle high school and a part time job   i wont get into the details but her illness had to do with hormone regulation so some days she would be stuck in bed and i would have to carry her around  some days she would be frantically doing activities and screaming at me for  literally  hours over anything i did  i thought i would have to deal with her alone if my step dad left  luckily he didnt and supported her   after all this i did my best to scramble together money so i could move out  i worked as many hours as i could at my high school job then transitioned to a local manufacturing company and worked even more  of course i got burnt out especially with my adhd which heightens anxiety and i would have panic attacks almost daily   shortly after switching to the local company i met a girl  again because of adhd and a difficult life so far  i jumped head first as fast as i could into the relationship  she was toxic and abusive  luckily it lasted for less than a year when on a lovely vacation with my family where i introduced her as my life partner  in the middle of the night she flew home leaving no trace other than a short text from the airport  months of depression later   my life finally took a turn for the better  covid happened and my company shut down per state order  yay unemployment  i built out my honda pilot to live in  and decided i would go on a road trip with the money i had saved and my newfound unemployment checks  before leaving i found my now fiancee  we hit it off and i still wanted to roadtrip so our 4th date was a 3 month journey living in the car traveling the country  when we returned we bought a camper  rented land  moved in  got kicked off said land and now live with my parents   not ideal but it's still pretty great   my beautiful and amazing girlfriend fiancee is the most supportive and caring person i could have asked for  i was planning on bumming around the world living out of a bag or i was toying around with the idea of suicide  i just couldnt imagine having to work another week and i didnt see the point of going on    now my life has purpose that isnt tied to a career or money and it's all because my girlfriend is a passionate person who loves what she does and is able to provide for us  everyday i try my best to enjoy myself and our life and do my best to make her feel lived and support her however i can  i've taken up making youtube videos and streaming on twitch  not for the money but to create and share what i know how to   tl dr it's been a rough life so far but things are looking up ,puxsj1

997,"""Some day this will all be yours"" Or, why taking over, or buying the small business you work for, might be a scam",while reading the tales of all the scummy bosses and shitty jobs posted here  i thought about the failed long con that i managed to dodge   twice in my long  and varied work history   and similar bullshit that happened to a handful of other friends and coworkers over the years    easentially  you find yourself in a pretty decent gig with a small  privately owned company  a few years in   the owner hits you with the news that they plan on  retiring  or selling out   in the future and you  are the perfect fit to take the business over  this proposal can have many motives  from a truly decent person who really wants you to succeed  to a whole lot of less than generous explanations    first  they may be just playing this game to suck you in deeper and get 110  out of you  since they scammed you into the delusion that you will be the owner someday  i watched this one go down when a friend left a small company for a union job  after too many broken promises regarding his future in the company  the owner tried to get him to stay with a last minute claim that he was just about to give him a stake in the company  it was laughable bullshit  with benefits  his pay essentially tripled when he started his new job   the next big con  the one i've avoided twice   was an owner who came to the realization that they are getting older  will need to retire someday soon   and don't have money saved   or a plan to successfully retire  they want to con you in to  running rhe business they own  so they can semi retire  retain control  and micromanage the business  while enjoing all the profit   and promising that they will sell it to you one day    the third scam i've encountered is the owner who really doesn't have anything of much value  when it comes to selling the business  the business may be performing poorly  or simply never going to be worth much  their goal is to sell to you  for their price and with their financing  i had a friend who was getting trapped into this  he quit  started doing exactly same work on his own   and doubled his pay   maybe it's odd that i've seen this game played so many times  maybe there is somebody out there in redditland that is watching the same thing going down in their own life  and would find this helpful  but it's a good lesson in the fact that you don't have to be grabbing a paycheck from the corporatocracy to find outright scumbaggery in your boss  lots of small business owners also suck   i may be old and cynical af  but as far as i'm concerned  most promises  from somebody that controls your paycheck  are nothing but bullshit  don't sell your soul for the biggest one of all   someday this will all be yours ,pv58yq

1045,Did I make the right call,i quit my job with a very good salary and walked out earlier this month  only been out of work 2 weeks    it was quite a small company who discribed themsleves as a  family   already that was a red light  they even said in the interview well somtimes we yell at each other like family too   another red flag  on my second day i was told by my manager  so and so  the higher up  will call and rip into you  but they won't start yet because your new  if you want to keep your job you'll sit and take it  we all do  i said to the line manager  if they do that i will complain and leave i don't put up with that at work   so over the next few months this is what i see  the  higher up   let's call them bob  i won't specify the role but it was c level   so i started to see sales staff come in all puffy eyes like they'd been crying  it turned out bob would call them whilst they were on the road to work and start screaming at them  about their work before their working day even started    the work load was way to high  you were expected to do the work of 3 people by yourself  and failure to do so would result in the calls i just mentioned  on top of the calls you would get emails from bob also complaining about your work   they never said thanks for anything as well    bob knew some of the staff were on the road for 6hrs a day which adds up to about a 13hr day  and bob still behaved this way   bob clearly didn't understand  that people don't get motivated by being given to much work to do then being yelled at multiple times a week on top     in this time make the company millons in profit  which got recognition from the ceo  yay me  but i hate being micromanaged and hearing constant moaning  and i don't like authority  that's the rebel in me  so at this point i'm losing my mind and my mental health is in freefall  the week i quit  i was pulled into a meeting with the other staff and written up via email  a full 2hrs before my working day starts  the meeting was via video call and basically bob took the time to tell me how shit i was and how my work was unacceptable  and that if u didn't like what he said i can leave etc  he did swear and did use personal insults all in front of over staff  he mentioned how he was trying to help me  and that he was being fair  they had offered no objectives regarding the project and bob seemed to believe i should be able to read his mind  dispite me asking for direction multiple times not enough help was offered   during the meeting bob was literally changing colour  because he was so angry  it turns out one of the staff was related to bob and he treated them even worse  bob was discribed to me as someone who likes to see if they can break people    of course i spend the rest of the day not doing any work  i then called bob later in the day and said i don't like the way people are being treated  bob then told me their position entitled them to speak to me like that  so i gave notice their and packed my bag and walked    now i'm unemployed and need money  i had a 2 day panic attack where i could bearly breathe  and have been sick along with it  my recruiter says i'm over worked and too stressed    what are y'alls thoughts on this  i think i made the right call  i'd rather work part time now if i'm honest,pv7h8i
1046,Honest questions,hi guys and gals of antiwork  i'm still wrapping my head around the ideology   i think there's a fundamental injustice going on from the billionaire class getting all the wealth while workers get screwed  but i'm not sure how to fix it   how can we do better   let's say i have an idea  or i invent some process to make the world better  i need people to help build  implement  and scale this invention  how do you fairly grant equity in the idea to workers   let's say i also have to take out a big loan in order to buy a bunch of equipment to make this product  and if the product fails  i have assumed all of that risk  how does this factor in to sharing the wealth generated by this company idea   there's an obvious cognitive bias here and i'm aware of it - why isn't this idea open-source  why am i trying to maintain control of it  i'm a big proponent of open-source software  but pretty much every oss has some sort of monetization strategy and a company attached  ubuntu wouldnt exist if not for ubuntu server and the companies who pay canonical to maintain it   but anyway  i digress  not really a discussion about software  moreso about how to execute on ideas fairly   how can i contribute to society and earn the things i want which are the fruits of others' labor  cars  boats  planes  houses  etc   not that i have those things - but i can aspire to have them   is owning ideas and things you invent okay up to a certain scale  then it becomes not okay ,pv3c22

1134,My most recent week of work.,i work for an insurance company that writes a particularly niche field of insurance  it's a very small world and most of the higher ups in that field know everyone else in that field  i've worked in this field of insurance for 9  years with two different companies  i ended up going to a direct competitor of my old company because they offered more money and the job is 100  remote   last thursday i was asked to author a document that had confidential information about my prior companies policies  rates  and fee structure so my current company could have competitive knowledge   i expressed to my boss about how that was inappropriate because i have an employee agreement from my old company and my old ceo is very litigious and petty  if that document got out and my name is on it  i'm screwed   i got a follow up email that what she asked was not actually what she wanted but she wanted more vague info about how our company can improve and what my old company could do to succeed  very neat to get gaslighting from her   i took the next day off because of stress   the day i come back i get a phone call from my boss asking me to help train a new person  i'm still not well trained at my current job after a year  i reluctantly agreed  then my boss said it was my fault about being upset by her request to give confidential info and she wanted more vague info  i just didn't read her exact words correctly  gaslighting again   yesterday  a week from her asking me for confidential info  i got an email about my training schedule for a different department in our company  i didn't know i was moving to different department   i asked if that department would be my sole responsibility  but i was told i would be expected to assume all responsibilities for my current department as well because we're short staffed   that was until there was a team meeting in the afternoon and we discovered that my current department lost their insurance carrier so there's no more work in that department   i guess i get to celebrate by knowing they want me on the payroll   in my mind i knew this would be happening  but no one communicated anything  i'm still viewed as a young person in the industry even though i've been in the industry for almost a decade  it's super fun to know your bosses still think of you as a child who can't be trusted with information and you will do what you're told because they said so   sorry for the long rant  i just have no one else to tell and to share the absurdity ,pupg43

1200,Is it worth it?,so  i ve been on unemployment for over a year  thankfully  but it has ended earlier this month and it s time for me to get a job again  the only experience i have is in restaurants  during this time off  i ve really been considering switching career paths since working in a kitchen gets you no respect  no benefits  easily injured  super stressed out  amp  usually a salary from  9- 11 an hour   however  i ve been getting offers on indeed for kitchen jobs that pay  20- 22 an hour with actual benefits like dental  health  401k  etc  i m unsure what path to choose right now  i haven t worked during the pandemic  amp  im unsure what to expect  are they starting to offer more because they re so understaffed  will the slightly better salary be worth it ,puo4az
1201,Why is it so hard to be a competent manager?,i've never been fully in charge of people before  but i have lead small teams in focused tasks  every time i read a story about a bad manager  its either an owner with an over inflated ego or a front line manager trying to be a kiss ass for their bosses and power tripping    here is what you need to be at least a decent manager   -respect your employees  it should be obvious  but your job as a manager should be to support your employees not lord over them     -if an employee makes a mistake  help them correct it  don't just yell at them  especially in front of others  its like an abusive parent who just wants to make sure you feel embarrassed for what you did  plus if you do really need to punish someone  do it in private    -pay them well or praise them as often as you can  again obvious  but employee happiness is directly tied to how much they make and will have an impact on your own productivity  if you aren't in charge of their money  at least make sure to give praise or a good review when the time comes for raises     -listen to their needs  a good manager is able to balance the needs of their employees with the needs of the company  if someone is sick  especially in covid times  let them take their own time off  if someone needs to be late  work with them to make up the time    if you can at least do these things  you should be easy enough to work with and get along with ,puopm3

1220,The US is a whole different breed,this story starts from 2019 but the ages i'll write are as of current    my uncle 64m  owns a small business that employs 25  employees  he has no family of his own and closest relative to him is my family but he lives overseas  the way he was managing the business wasn't that good but also wasn't that bad  he'd just complain unmotivated employees  high expenses  etc here and there    so i 23m  visited him and his business and we talked everything about it for almost 3 months  i proposed a plan to him to which he agreed but few months later he got sick and his health started deteriorating to the point he asked me if i could manage it  i accepted but for the mean time until he gets a replacement or so i thought    here are things that i changed   1- increased every employee's salary by 30  their salary was slightly higher 10-20  than the market wage  2- made the whole month of june pto  it's the least active month and doesn't generate much revenue so might as well make it pto  3- hired branding and advertising agency  4- hired a few more employees to ease workflow processes   5- fired my uncle's friend's his son  there were complaints about him not doing much work and  mild sexual harassment  uncle knew about the former fact but not the latter  nepotism is real in this country  but not in this company    6- decorated the whole workplace and vehicles in a way that they'd  lift up the mood     a year after this changes  the results were   1- the employees were much active and motivated to get work done  2- revenue was  40  higher than the avg of previous 2 years which is huge  and vehicular expenses went down by 36  my guess is employees started taking care of the vehicles    3- had employees come up to me with clients they've found themselves  4- no one quit  and there has only been three call-in-sick cases the whole year    second year 2020-2021  was all good but not much growth  but we hadn't invested in anything that year so understandable     i left for college after that and uncle hired his friend whose son was fired  i told him that wasn't a good decision but he promised nothing will change and his son won't be hired  as a thank you  he put me on his will  few months went by and i get a text from one of the employees saying that friend was corrupt and suspected he might be stealing  told uncle about it and he investigated it  few weeks later he only told me he fired him but wouldn't say the reason    he rather quickly hired an mba graduate who studied in the us  and that mf changed up everything  he gave a speech in which he said he set the salary back to the market wage  which is 40-50  lower  and said if you want those increases then work for it  removed june as pto  and the one that pissed me off the most is that he said there'll no longer be free coffee pods and that they should get their own  ever since i've talked to my uncle and he said he'd set up a meeting with him physically present and i through ms teams  uncle said he'd give me the courtesy to fire him remotely lol    as a conclusion  i think this kind of thinking stems from the us  it's a known fact that the us believes solely in money  so maybe that could explain their greediness and hunger for power to control everyone so they could get the money for themselves ,pudici

1224,My Old Teacher Got Bullied By Students Into Quitting Her Job…Principal Couldn’t Do Nothing About It, the reason why i make this post is because recently  a school in my area shut down and has made all students go back to at home learning because the students have misbehaved so bad due to the lick challenge  that the school punishing students isn t helping  this has led to parents arguing that the school should be the one to teach kids morals    for context    gt i had this teacher during my senior year of high school  all of the previous years  all i heard was how much students loved her and how she was considered the best teacher in the school  she was there for a long time and was extremely chill  during the last 20 minutes of class  she let us all have free time and do whatever we want  we also got to watch tons of movies and do goofy acting activities   what led to her quitting    gt my class was quite possibly the worst mix of kids to have in a class  half the class was full of divas yes gurll  queens  the other half was full of dudes who would always act up  then there was the very few people who weren t either and were just there to be there    gt halfway through the year  queen fever came upon us  queen fever is when the most diva esque people unleash their inner diva to the extremes and annoy people with it  that s when the class first started acting up and getting out of control    gt during the second half of the school year  many of the guys and girls would constantly argue and fight with each other in class  it got so out of hand to where it became a constant  and nearly everyday thing    how she ended up quitting    gt eventually  all of the drama got so out of hand in class  that students would start back talking the teacher on a daily basis  so bad  that the students would start arguing with the god damn teacher and we weren t even 2 months into the second half of the year either  these arguments would take up so much time and then other students would join in on these arguments and make it worse   gt eventually  drama got so out of hand that people started being sent to the office and getting write ups and saturday school  our form of detention  at one point  half of the class ended up intentionally misbehaving to get on the teachers nerves  it got so bad  that i shit you not  half of the class got sent to the office  the principal and vice principal would constantly be called in  but as soon as they disappeared  here comes the students  ahit talking the teacher again   gt the teacher had one last plan  instead of the fun  laid back class we would normally have  she changed the whole class up  no longer did we sit in groups  but spread out  we had to do book work and reading in silence which we never did  and the teacher said we would do this from beginning to the end of every class until we got our acts together  class was an hour and thirty minutes long so imagine just sitting in silence doing book work   gt none of this worked and even more petty students started intentionally making as much noise as they possibly could  and started fights to show their way of rebelling against the teacher    teacher quits and gives her grievances while class cheers    gt around march  the teacher comes in and sits down and has everyone listen  the teacher explains how stressed she has been because of the class and how it s been affecting her mentally  she then says  never in my years here have i ever had a class that misbehaved or acted so bad  i can t believe it  i gave you guys everything and y all still treat me like this  she then announced that she would be quitting and never working at our school again and that she would not be there the next time we came to class    gt i shit you not  after she said this  the entire class except me and a very very rare few fucking cheered and was praising hallelujah  i was like wtf is wrong with this class dude  if you guys are wondering  this happened over near memphis so i guess you could see where the bad class even comes from    gt students who had her in other class periods were actually very sad that she was quitting and i was too  it s fucking horrible how many of the female students in my class straight up challenged her to a fight like wtf   what can we take away from this   gt my former teacher is literal proof that no amount of punishment from a school or a teacher will get a student to behave  she gave many people chances and even tried to give us moral speakings but the class kept bullying her which drove her to quit her job  not even the principal could do anything about it   gt parents  you need to discipline your kids and teach them better  a lot of parents don t know how their kids really act  but a teacher does  too many teachers have been bullied at parent teacher conferences because they gave timmy a f for refusing to do a assignment  the parent then argues that timmy is a saint and would never refuse to do work,puc82i

1233,Sick of feeling like a criminal at work - VENT,tl dr  i want to cut back my hours at work so i can do well in my studies and enjoy my life and my employer is being shitty about it and now i'm venting on reddit   i've been at my current job for almost 3 years  it's tech support in a call centre for an internet service provider so you can imagine how fucking mind numbingly shitty it is  and for most of that time i've worked 4 days a week because when i started i had just moved out to the countryside from the city  and knew my cost of living would be so much lower that i could now afford to  and my mental health was also really bad at that time  i've stayed on 4 days because i like the lifestyle that affords me   recently i started some online study  some law units  i want to get a law degree  and as part of that i had previously asked if i could cut back to 3-days a week  i'll be super poor  but i think it will enable me to really throw myself into my studies  which i want to take priority in my life right now  i'm 27 and have only ever worked shitty  dead-end jobs that i've hated after 2-3-years  and i view my studies as a way to get out of that cycle   so i asked to cut back to 3-days a week to focus on my studies and was told that couldn't be done  whatever  i thought  i'll give it a go and just knuckle down and we'll see how how it ends up   shortly after starting uni  it became really clear to me that this was going to be harder to manage than i thought  especially with the ongoing covid-19 situation where i live  victoria  australia  my mental health was suffering again  and i wasn't able to put as much into my schoolwork as i wanted to  so i went to a doctor and got a note from them saying that it would be appropriate for me to cut back to 3-days a week at work   i've given this to my manager  and this led to a meeting now with another higher-up  but i have been told that the site manager is currently on-leave so they  can't tell me anything for sure  yet   i'm so over the way they're acting about it  they're just being so cagey and annoying  making me jump through all these hoops and have all these meetings  with people high and higher up the ladder over it  to say nothing of asking me personal questions about my studies and my mental health  they're behaving as if this would be a  massive  deal and i'm really bending their arms by asking for such a serious favour  it just pisses me off  lots of people work part-time jobs and it's literally perfectly fine  they're one of those  we're a family  companies and 99  of the other employees have totally drunk the kool-aid on that  but i kind of refuse to and have spoken up in the past about things i think are unfair  and been involved in some union activity as well   i honestly think i'm being made to feel like a criminal or like a shitty employee just because i don't put the interests of the company first in my life  but i will literally  never  ever  do that for them ever again after being put through this  hundreds of  people work at this call centre and they won't let  one  cut back to 3-days a week  it's a fucking bottom rung position taking shitty ass fucking calls from old cunts who don't know an ethernet port from their own assholes--not exactly something that requires you to be there 5 fucking days a week   thanks for coming to my ted rant ,pu9isz

1244,1/2 pay for disability,tl dr  i'm on disability until february  at least  due to my job making my anxiety and depression much  much worse  i am receiving 1 2 my usual pay but this pay cut is a lot less stressful than actually going to work  also my manager sucks and the company sucks for making my manager suck  and i fear the company might find an excuse to eliminate my employment due to this whole thing      about a month ago i went on disability for severe depression and anxiety  now  my job wasn't the cause of it  i know this  but it definitely was a huge contributor because my job is incredibly boring and full of people who clearly don't want to be there so having casual fun conversation isn't an option because everyone's so bitter  save for one  maybe two of my coworkers  and i don't want to deal with it     i'd been stuck doing the same thing all day  12 hour workdays  for over a year  begging for cross training so i can at least contribute and feel like a part of the  team   extremely loose use of the word  instead of being stuck with this mindless task of literally just moving and scanning boxes of our manufactured product    the thing is  the pay is pretty good and the health insurance is a necessity  i've been sticking around only for those reasons because  in theory  i was going to save up for a year  maybe two  to move somewhere with better job opportunities and health care   but  my manager has hounded me about the stupid break policy that the company has  1 hour tool-to-tool  meaning that i have to use one third of my break time taking off and putting on the full body clean room suit and getting to the lunch area  i  among others  have protested this policy and literally no one gives a shit what the company says about it except for the managers   he caught me coming back from break 10-15 minutes later than he wanted me to due to the company's policy and held me up for about five minutes complaining to me about not being at my tools  which is where i was headed  annoyed with him wasting the company's time i said  whatever  and continued on my way  i got written up for that and he wouldn't accept that he was just wasting time that he apparently cared so much about    my manager also told me that i had to let someone know if i'm going to the toilet so  the tools don't sit  another instance where we are supposed to take off our clean room suits so it takes more time than to just go in  do our business  and head back  nobody  and i mean nobody covers the tools when i've gone and -i- am the one who gets the flack for it if my manager catches me coming back from the bathroom    also when people call out for any reason the manager demands a doctor's note for us to come back to work    dealing with that and the sheer boredom of the mindless stupid job  i've never been bored before  turns out boredom makes me anxious and angry  all i can really do all day is think  and overthink  and i hit a wall of depression and twelve hours of thinking in my already darkened mindset led me to seriously contemplate offing myself    i called my manager the last day i was there  two hours into the workday  and told him i needed to go home  i'm clearly in emotional distress at this point telling him my head's awash with terrible thoughts and the first words to come out of his mouth were  i'm going to need a doctor's note   i responded with  you already have a universal fucking doctor's note for my depression and anxiety  i am not going out and searching for another goddamn note for you   probably could have handled that better but  again  i was in distress  i did apologize for my response but expressed that he should never have said that to someone in the state i was in  in the first place    a week and a half later my doctor was talking to me about my return to work date which was fast approaching and i nearly had an anxiety attack on the spot    i will be starting a therapy program next month which will take 16-18 weeks  i decided to go on disability for this time because frankly i need to get the hell away from that place if i'm going to make any improvement on my headspace    i know it's not exactly legal  but i fear the company will let me go  not that it would so much be a problem for me  other than losing my insurance  because i intend to find other employment elsewhere when i feel like i can muster an interview or three  but the company has done some real shady shit and have shot themselves in the foot many a time    and i'm well aware that if they have a layoff  it hasn't happened in a while but it's happened fairly often  they target people who are on disability  which i guess since they aren't contributing to the company is somewhat understandable  i guess   but not entirely indiscriminate    i need the insurance and i hate that i need the insurance because i would have left a long time ago if i could get the healthcare i need and apply for unemployment for a time after leaving    sorry for the rant  there's a lot more with this but it would have turned into a novel instead of a shirt story at this point ,pu0tmc
1245,My answer to 'what is antiwork?',   antiwork  is against exploitative work  like extorting someone to work for you  under threat of homelessness  starvation  or loss of healthcare  once  these things are guaranteed rights then work will truly be consensual  and workers will have the power to retain the value of their labour   thats  what antiwork is about  working to enrich yourself rather than a  capitalist  they think work should be optional and consensual  and  should enrich the worker  right now capitalists and landlords steal the  value of labour from people who actually do work  they're parasites  a big section of antiwork is simply pushing for a ubi and more worker-owned co-ops to bring democracy to the workplace      thats my answer  what is yours ,pu59jy

1255,The cause?,i think there are many reasons we are where we are as a society and why the world has become such a difficult place to work in   it started of course with the advent of electricity  leading to the assembly lines  and forced urban living just to survive   this then led to the slippery slope of devalued and more importantly interchangeable human labor   modernly  i think one simple rule could make a world of difference  getting rid of franchises if we didn t have 10 s of thousands of mcdonalds and starbucks and subway and ralph s and so on  we would have so many opportunities for people to fill the void  open small local restaurants  pharmacies  grocery stores and everything else if all of the burger joints closed  people still need to eat and others will step up to open places and the middle class would be reborn instead of some guy opening 20 or 200 wendy s locations  then sitting at home  and paying minimum wage to everyone   20 or 200 people would open new restaurants maybe run it with family and so on   there would also be the added benefit of innovation new places would encourage new ideas and creations and the burger and hot dog wouldn t be the main or most well known american dish ,pu3fps

1264,Pay Day is Such a Strange Concept,i really like my job  the people i work with are great  i enjoy the work and i feel like i m genuinely contributing and being useful rather than just making someone else money    however due to some oddities of how pay roll is kept  i m not getting paid for the entire month of september  i should be paid twice in about a week  once on the 30th and once on the 1st  all of this despite working all month    it s such a strange concept that a job can make you work with essentially just an iou  like i have clearly provided the agreed upon value  but because it s more convenient for them  they get to hold on to that value for almost a month in this case    it s a relationship that absolutely does not go the other way  i cannot have them pay me and tell them i owe them the work    i don t really know if this fits here  i was just frustrated when i checked my account and had nothing in there again ,pufsnk
1265,Sick time,of of    ,pu2xm1
1266,What am I even doing?!,i have a full time job that pays well and has great benefits  i get 5 weeks of vacation a year and unlimited sick days  i use my education in this work to do something i m passionate about    only thing is  it s too easy for me  i m not super intellectually challenged so i get bored a lot  there s also not a lot of room to grow in my organization  so it s a bit of a dead-end   so i started job searching for a harder job with a better title  but honestly i know my field and it probably won t pay a whole lot more  benefits will likely stay the same or get worse   i came across this sub during my job search  now while i m filling out applications  i m kind of asking myself why  my marriage has never been better  i have time for multiple hobbies  i get to see my friends a lot  why am i looking for harder work   i grew up in a high achieving family and the fact that i didn t become a doctor of lawyer was kind of a disappointment for everyone  so i was taught from a young age that success meant titles and a high salary and not being able to take days off because the office needed you so much  so  i guess i was sort of ashamed of my job and that i wasn t living up to my full potential   but what does that even mean anymore  is that even what success is  i feel like maybe i was living in the wrong reality  i ve had the urge to call and cancel all my active applications   just what is work even ,pufpzo
1267,Quit after 1 day,i'm a student who applied to a job at ups online   i now have gotten a much better offer  i show up for the interview and they're like  well actually work starts at 330 am m-f  and you can have time off in a year  the only reason people work this job is to get paid white collar money as a driver without an education  for now  15 an hour  i have 18 credits  i like my life  supervisor was nice and all  but it's literally scrambling to lift heavy shit into a truck in numerical order for 5 hours with one 10 minute break  moral of the story is corporate automatically sending out applications that don't match the actual job at the location is not a good way to get workers ,pudqen
1268,"I got a job offer with higher pay, more paid days off but a longer commute - i need your experience",so i'm working at this company for 8 years now  it was my first job after school   i'm living in germany btw  because of this i'm lacking of experience on how to decide  maybe some of you could help me    the job itself is awesome  i love what i'm doing  but everything around it sucks  my boss is an ahole  laughs about the concept of work-life balance  doesn't want to pay our overtime but refuses to let us take them off  too  so he tries to disguise our christmas bonus as a  bonus  when in reality it's just our overtime money  he was furious when we demanded more paid days off  so instead of the legal minimum of 20 days he gave us one day extra   the law in germany says 20 days  but it's more than common to have 30  days  i don't know anyone who got less than 30  even in times of lockdown he said homeoffice is a nono  even though my job is the number one example from working from everywhere in the world  i'm working 40h per week   the very big plus  i only have a 15-20 minute commute  my colleagues are the bomb  i'm very good at what i'm doing there and i love my tasks  the pay is mediocre but since i'm very frugal i am able to live with it  the job is very secure for at least the next 5 years   so now i've got a job offer from an old classmate   i've been working with him for a few projects as a side job the last couple of months and now he wants me fulltime  he offers 3 days of homeoffice  30 paid days off  only 37 5h per week and 4k yearly more than i am making now  plus im suspecting a christmas bonus   i love to work with him  he cares a lot about work-life balance and that the team is happy   the big bummer  the two days i have to be in the office are a 1h commute each way and i don't know how secure this job is  since this company is rather new    it's driving me crazy  right now i'm in my comfort zone where i'm ok with my job  i learned to not give a shit about my boss  do my work  go home and live my life   should really leave this safety for something new ,puesdc

1293,My thoughts from the beginning of the year,i posted the below on social media near the beginning of 2021  before i had heard of this sub  now that i'm trapped full-time in an office  i felt like sharing   -----------------  so  y'all have probably seen a berjillion comments on the interwebz about this or have heard it from me  but i'm in the office and thinking about just that and decided to actually put some thoughts into words  rambling as they may be as i don't do this very often   with vaccination numbers rising and covid cases dropping  i'm waiting for the inevitable question of  when do you want to come back to the office full time  something that was being asked of me throughout the entirety of the pandemic   it may just be millenial ol' me  but my answer is  never  working from home is amazing  prior to the pandemic throwing a wrench into things  work was 8 hours of sitting in a cubicle with maaaaybe 2 hours of actual work  and that was if it was done at a leisurely pace  when there wasn't anything coming in  i had nothing to do  oh  there's always something to  do  but i'm fairly certain we all know that more often than not entails some tedious task that isn't important enough to warrant being in our job descriptions duty rosters whatever    the pandemic has certainly held a mirror up to the way we live and having been mostly working from home for a year now  i don't really want that to change  being bored at home is different from being bored at work  as you can imagine  when i've finished my work at home  i can take care of the chores and work on all that self-improvement and maintenance we're  ideally  supposed to have time for in our society  but really don't  though that's a rant for another day from better informed folk  barring the days of existential dread  melancholy  and frothing rage towards the sheer idiocy of my government  amp  fellow americans  i had time for those things  i lifted weights  practiced music on my apartment's balcony  and even dealt with the pile of laundry that occassionally graced my bedroom floor   when the pandemic is over  who's heard that a million fucking times  i don't want to go back to an office because it's all my bosses seem to know  they don't seem to understand that if i have my laptop and an internet connection  i could work from anywhere  and unbeknownst to them  have  parks  my car  etc  there's always an attitude of  what if we need ya  well  you know how to use a phone and email  so if you can figure out a scanner  you're basically caught up with modern office tech  that scanner is  i'm 100  certain  the only reason i am still required to head into the office every day  scanning documents  cuz no one else can be bothered it seems  when i was at home and lifting weights  practicing music  etc  my work phone was never far  once i was notified of something that needed doing  it was done  but i always had the feeling that my bosses thought i was being lazy  to be fair  i am  and just coasting along  playing video games  which i tried a few times before accepting that having them interrupted by calls emails really sucked the fun out and i stopped  i still feel a little bad about that one  but  in spite of what they thought  the work got done  they just weren't seeing me in my cubicle while it happened    my earlier comment about  millenial ol' me  comes from the frustration of my bosses desire to get me back into the office like it's the only thing i have to look forward to after the pandemic  coupled with their seeming inability unwillingness to learn some basic tech  i don't say this to shit on older generations  but to refer back to that mirror i mentioned  many of us saw that we didn't have to do things the way they have been for decades  and i feel that my bosses are stuck in that old corporate office school of thought that the 40-hour work week is still the end-all be-all and haven't learned a damn thing or otherwise gotten with the times  we're supposed to learn and change for the better on an individual and societal level with new information  that's the fucking point of it all  a tangentially related note  their idiotic decision to have me work partial days in an office late last year to  be productive part of the team  meant i was surrounded by folk who half-assed basic covid safety measures resulted in many of us getting sick with the virus  while i laid in bed  struggling to get a satisfying breath of air  i wondered if i was going to die and what my chances of getting admitted to a hospital were  i'm still mad and have none of the respect for my bosses that i used to  i hope their maskless meeting at the table was fucking worth it   overall  i think the point i'm trying to make here  that you've all heard in one form or another  is that things could always have been better for us and it took a fucking disease to show it  my situation is not a blanket statement that could be applied to every profession  amp  walk of life  or maybe it could  with some tweaks  but the fact is that all our of lives could've likely been less of a struggle in a myriad number of ways  ubi  universal healthcare  housing costs rent  an educational system that wasn't treated like filth  a goverment comprised of individuals who actually understand grade school science  etc  and to see so many people who want to go back to the way things were before like that was fine is idiotic  wishful thinking  i don't lambast the sentiment  the year's been fucking rough  but to come out the other side not knowing better is a recipe for fucking disaster when this happens again  hopefully  not in our lifetime  but it will happen again and maybe next time the body count won't be literally worse than 100 9 11s ,ptze7w
1294,I'm done. Time to leave this job.,hi all   i'm new but have been lurking for a long time now   some backstory   i'm currently working as a tech support phone mail  for different corporate customers  my work shifts varies greatly since we're open from 06 00 - 22 00  the schedule really goes up and down and no week is the same  on top of that our weekend shifts are 12 hours and on those weeks i can work up to 60 hours  our office is also the most grey  dull and soulless office i've ever been in  nothing like any modern tech company  it's weird but i get stress symptoms and stomache aches just from being in the office - not from the job itself when i can do it at home   but you know what has been a godsend  work from home during covid which really made it all tolerable  and up until today management has been very vague if we would be able to continue or now  guess what  we will absolutely not be able to work from home anymore  apparently we are losing so much when we are working from home  but neither me nor my co-workers understand exactly what we're losing    that is it  i won't have it anymore  i will quit   luckily i've been able to save about a years salary so i can vibe at home for that time if i so wish  i'm planning to hand in my resignation around november  work december and then be free by january there is generally a one or more month notice in my country that goes both ways so it's fair enough   you know what the worst part is  even though i've come to terms with my own decision i still have that nagging feeling society forces us to believe  that you absolutely can not find a job when you're unemployed and that you are useless for not having one  it's a weird mix of feelings  but many decades of societal pressure has made us feel like it's wrong to just want to vibe for a while ,pu20rs

1298,Anyone feel like taxes are way too high for the average working American?,i don t care about raising income taxes for higher brackets because they get most from capital gains and that needs to be addressed  but there s such a jump for people making  500k or less a year  i know some anesthesiologists can bring in  300-500k and it makes sense because they re also paying  3-6k in student loans  malpractice  etc  i don t think these people should be punished for getting through medical school and being skilled  but if you re making like  110k or less it for sure feels like highway robbery  especially because we also have to pay into health insurance  etc  it s like you grow up poor and somehow claw up to  60-85k right  i m still at  47k but will reach 85k over four years on a contract  but then  85k turns into  62k after taxes  then you gotta pay premiums and retirement  then you get reamed by property and sales tax  and before you know it your net income is what your gross income was at  47k  i know the median income for average americans is like  35k and they re worse off but the point is that it feels impossible to get ahead and afford a house and not be stressed  like if you make  9k a year you get taxed 10  what bullshit is that  like that pays 1-3 months rent in some places and that s it  it s just insane  you get laid off and get severance or unemployment  taxes when you need it most  i hate taxes in the us because we get nothing to show for it  they immediately claw it away before you even get your check  idk maybe this is an unpopular opinion but it frustrates me that people at the bottom get taxed so damn much in income and spending and we have so little after  we are literally peasants  first world privileged peasants but still peasants ,pu0eyi

new manager  and he as well was transferred after a few weeks  this is when we got dexter  dexter was a socially inept  dweeby nerdy yes man  a type our vapid area manager was quite fond of  dexter promptly changed our cubicle assignments to put all the attractive girls next to him  my seating didn t change lol    i had a meeting with dexter early on  to discuss my management training  and to let him know what i had worked on  and that i was willing to do whatever it took to continue that path  he was none too interested  he told me my email handle time was a little low  and that i would need to work on that before even being considered for further training  i should say  that yes  my email times were not exceptional  but more around average  i just had trouble focusing on it  where i shined was on the phone  i could get people taken care of and off the phone faster than anyone on my team  period  and with exceptional client satisfaction and feedback  dexter didn t give a flying fuck  back to the cubicle with me   shortly after  one of the girls dexter moved to his area started getting the management training opportunities  then shortly after was made a manager  my spirit was from then on  broken  shortly after this  the girl was stupid enough to text another of the girls who was moved nearby that she had been having sex with dexter  scandal  dexter was swiftly fired  and the girl got to keep her position  but was moved to a different department  as she had lost all respect from the hundreds of people in our area   anyway  i got 3 new managers over the next 3 months  that is six different managers for my team  in 6 months  and was being relentlessly picked on with  action plans  for petty grievances  even though i was one of the area management's  favorites  they had doubled our workload twice in the past year  making it no longer an easily manageable thing  but rather an awful  never ending stream of people who were angry because we didn't have the time to assist them properly  my last manager even had the fucking nerve to recommend i get prescribed to adderall so that i could cope with the new workload  i finally broke  it was sxsw week and i was stuck in a cubicle staring at the beautiful austin hill country outside  i walked out and no call no showed the entire week while i enjoyed life  came back the next week  expecting my card not to work when i buzzed in the door  but it did  they gave me the degree of  if you want to stay  its going to be much harder for you  you will have to not be tardy at all for 9 months or you will be let go  i left  i quit    i have been struggling ever since with gig work  but i was able to pursue my music and passions  i lost the stress of the corporate america  but gained the stresses of the poverty line  i will say  i am easily happier  working for for smaller businesses and gig work when i need  but my family and others were always there to remind me how  stupid  my decision was  i now no longer deal with these doubts  after reading you all's stories here  i am absolutely proud to be a part of this movement that i wasn't aware i was a part of till recently  and it is time to make working in this country more sustainable  and less time consuming  lets fucking do this   i also have a story for my job before apple that i was fired from after 6 six years i may share later ,pu3bqm

1330,Retention Bonus vs. Promotion,been in my role for 11 years and recently found out my company s paying a new hire with little to no experience 15  more than what i currently make  on top of that  i m currently managing the workload of 3 until they can hire more people  when i spoke up about these issues the company assured me they d figure something out    the solution i ve been offered is a promotion into management  the only problem is that i love my current role  of course i m grateful for the opportunity to advance but i wasn t really looking to add on to my responsibilities   current workload  the company also made it pretty clear that they can t  or won t  address any of the grievances i ve spoken up about if i don t take the promotion  something just doesn t seem fair to me but maybe i m being petty   what do you all think  is a promotion as good  better or worse than a retention bonus ,pu4s37

1371,How do we fix staffing in the restaurant industry?,hey y'all  i wanted to post this question to draw on all of your experiences to try to find a solution for my current situation   i am the general manager of a restaurant and i am on salary  that means that i have to work as many hours as required to keep the restaurant running smoothly  it is a small business with one location that is looking to expand and we are currently in the process of opening some new locations   for perspective  the owner is a really nice guy who wants to use his position as a restaurant owner to create a workplace where people can be happy  make a living wage  and have a work life balance  i am in the unique position of being able to help shape the culture and trajectory of this business to achieve the goal of making it a place where people are actually happy to come to work and make a wage that allows them to support themselves  it is a great opportunity and also a great responsibility   the issue i'm running in to is how to allow people to have the time off that they want to live their life the way they see fit without fucking other people over in the restaurant  the restaurant industry has long run on exploitation of laborers  people are broke and hungry for hours so that they can pay their bills  so when there is a lack of coverage in an average restaurant  there are plenty of people willing to take on extra shifts to make ends meet   in our restaurant  everyone gets a living wage and has the availability they want to go to school  travel  or do whatever they want to do in life  because of this  when we are short if someone goes on vacation  staffing the restaurant falls on me  our staff doesn't want to take on extra hours because they are already getting paid enough to live comfortably and they have a life outside of work  totally understandable  i'm working 70 hours next week because someone who i was relying on ended up leaving while 2 other staff members were set to go on vacation  because he wants pursue his creative dreams and was invited to a bunch of events  i am happy for him  but this is putting me in a bad situation and is not sustainable when it comes to building a model for staffing a restaurant  there is nobody else to staff the restaurant other than me  our owner is the kind of guy who will come in and help out whenever  but he is also out of town for a family commitment so it is bad timing   all that being said  i'm not so much talking about this specific situation as i am about the industry as a whole  how do we build an industry that can account for unexpected staffing shortages without keeping employees in a state of constantly being hungry for hours  and without fucking over management with 70 hour weeks  i am excited to hear this community's thoughts on this situation ,ptl9n5

1380,The chance to change work culture,i've been following this sub for a little while now  and with it i found my new home  i know a lot of people and i am one of the only self employed entrepreneurs that i know  i am a 31 year old guy from the netherlands and i got fired at every job that i had  and i had a lot    back when i started working at around 14  i got into hospitality with a mixture of all facets that it offers  i've worked as a waiter  a barman and a cook  i had jobs for 1 day  i had jobs for 2 years  but every time there came a moment where i called in sick for the 3-4th time and knew i would get fired because of it  i always weighed down the consequences and always came to the conclusion that it wasn't a problem  sure sometimes i had no money  but i could always find a new job with ease   during my student time i did 9 different studies  but none felt right  until i started working as a call center agent  this was the moment that i realized that i didn't want to do a shitty fucked up job for the rest of my life  i registered for my last studies  which coincidentally was also my first  and finished without any hickups  being older then my classmates and knowing how shit life is when working a underpaid and undervalued job was  made me excel in what i did    in my second year i started my own company for web- and graphic design  my first project was a massive bluff for a way to low price  but it felt so good to finally be able to work for no one but myself  never did i sit behind my desk and slacked away  what was the point  it was my own time so slacking meant i would just go and chill  at the end of my second year of my last studies  my right to loaning money from the government was ending  shit  i still had to do 2 more years  i don't know how  but the month that my loan ended  i got a big project that gave me a very good amount of money  it was 4k  but back i was living off  -1000 euro's a month  i had moments where my money was gone and i had to wait for payment from projects that i did  i had moments where i didn't have projects and thought  fuck how am i gonna survive  mind you  in those days i smoked 1 gram of weed daily  how i got that money still baffles me    in september 2018 i graduated and thought to myself  now is the moment that i can focus fulltime on my own company  2019 was a decent year  i didn't make a lot but i had enough  still i made a vow with one of my old classmates  that if 2020 wouldn't give us a steady income we would find a job  2020 started really well  i got a massive potential project for the dutch police  the day my contact had his meeting with the chief of police and all the heads of each province  corona hit  full lockdown  no one was spending any money  i stressed out as hell  i started looking for jobs that paid me weekly  found a job as a cook at a small bistro  i went for the interview and they asked me what i wanted to earn  i gave them a unrealistic amount because i thought fuck it  they can only go lower  it was  18 an hour  which is a shit ton for cooks in the netherlands  they offered me  16 euro's and i laughed my ass off because that amount is insane compared to the wages i made a couple years back    when the day came for my first shift i just didn't show  i couldn't get myself to go and work as a cook anymore  my mind just couldn't fathom the fact that i was back at this kind of shitty work  i called the bistro a couple hours after i didn't show and just pretended that i didn't know i had to work that day  they kinda believed my bluff and gave me another chance the week afterwards  when that day came i was halfway there on my bike and said  fuck it  this is not who i am anymore  and i turned around  the week after that i found a job as a webdeveloper at a small company  this was more acceptable because it was one for my level   i started that job at 9 00 in the morning  as a decent guy i showed up at 8 45  but my boss only showed up at 9 15  okay no problem  when the clock hit 17 00 i started packing my shit  my boss looked at me and said   what are you doing  me   well it's 17 00  my 8 hours are done  him   but what about the 30 minute break you had  me   eh really  you're gonna do that  instantly i became annoyed and thought to myself that this shit wouldn't happen in a  decent  job    time went by and i made a deal with my employer that i could work from home on thursday  this was during the peak covid times when everyone was told to work at home anyways  it was really hard for me to get this deal as my employer wanted me to come in to work because he wanted to be able to spar with me about my work  obviously this almost never happened  during this period i would sometimes work on a late night because i had an epiphany and just wanted to create something  this was all overtime that i wouldn't get paid for  i did it because it felt right and i wanted to use my insights before i forgot about it  eventually there was a moment where my boss went home early and i had to work for 30 more minutes  i went home 5 minutes before the assigned end time and my boss found out because he forgot his keys and had to drive back  he was fucking furious  his punishment was me losing my day of working at home  queue my hidden rage     all these tiny things pissed me off so much that i came to the same conclusion that i had at all my previous jobs   this shit isn't worth it  money isn't that important  this eventually led to the fact that my contract wasn't renewed  i had a contract for 1 year  this was 1 month ago  the day my contract ended i rented a workspace at a shared workspace place  in the month that i rented that thing i got 4 leads and 2 projects  today i got a big project confirmation for about 10k  i've never been happier in the past 2 years as i am now  working for myself is so much more gratifying then working for a boss   my whole point with this story is for the people that i see posting similar shit that happened to me  my only tip i want to give you is  if it seems like you get undervalued  underpaid  underperformed at your current job  don't think about the money and problems that might occur when you don't have a job  think about how much happiness you can achieve if you start working on yourself    i know this isn't possible for everyone  but if you are in a position where you can't go on your own  change your life by thinking about what makes you happy  and start focusing on achieving that happiness  yolo is a bad meme  but it's the truth  if you get hit by a bus tomorrow you'd be wanting to know that you enjoyed life to the fullest    tldr  focus on what makes you happy and start applying every aspect of you life to achieving that happiness  money isn't important  with the right mindset you can achieve anything you want ,ptiwae

1404,Employer Has Us Parking Offsite - Hired Security to Carpool Us to and from Lot,i work at a large grocer in dallas  tx that was recently renovated and had it's grand re-opening last june  in order to maximize parking for customers the company has hired private security and rented a van and a portion of a parking lot from a church about a mile and half away from the store for the employees to park their cars  before the store renovation we were allowed to park in the farthest part of the on-premises lot  now  there are always at least two security folks on staff at anytime of day  24 hrs a day  either watching the lot or carting our employees to and from the lot in the van  which seats 7 incl  driver     there are about 350 employees on shift throughout the week and no one is allowed to park on premises  including over-night shifts when the store is closed  write-ups threatened     ever since this began  i and a large majority of the employees have all been late by several minutes to their shift start-time on many occasions  this is due to many variables  i will list the common occurrences why employees have difficulty getting to work on time       1  the van is full and we have to wait for it to go and come back  sometimes twice    2  the van is pulling away as we pull into the lot and miss it   the drivers of the van will never stop and wait for you    3  traffic to and from the lot  also two major intersections to go through before getting to the store    4  security employees drive like grandmas  since they are being closely monitored by our company and their own they are overly cautious    5  security shift change happens at 6a when the majority of store shifts start  they are sometimes late so there is no one in the lot when we arrive    6 van driver wont return to lot immediately because they stopped into the store to use restroom or get a snack and drink   7  security employees stopping and chatting with one another as they pass taking calls while driving so they have to pull over and stop  this has seemed to have stopped  not completely  due to complaints from our employees      we are not allowed to be clocked-in until we arrive in the store and if we are late there could be disciplinary action  at the discretion of your department manager  my manager understands and is lenient and does not write-up any of my dept co-workers for being a couple minutes late  however  i know of many other employees from other depts being written-up for being late by one or more minutes   a good portion of us have expressed our grievances to store leadership that company time is being wasted along with our own personal time  none of us  want  to be late  we want to start our shift on time and get all of the time on the clock as possible       the employees would like the company to recognize that our personal time ends and company time begins the moment we start waiting in that off-site parking lot     leadership  of course  was aghast at this idea and suggested that we waste more of our personal time by arriving much earlier to the parking lot  personally  one instance i have arrived in the lot at 545a for a 6a shift start and i still didnt clock-in until 619a  that's 15 minutes of my time that i added onto an already 30min commute and 19 minutes of company time that i was not on the clock prepping the store for a 7a open       i have notified corporate hr about this and they are now investigating  investigating what  i have no idea  their response was vague  which is typical of hr       we really feel taken advantage of   time theft  is bullshit  because the moment any of us  steal  company time  fired  but our time  no  just waste more of it to make sure youre not wasting company time      the contempt is insulting and dehumanizing       tldr  boss make us park far away  all late many time  all want pay for wait on van  boss no care ,ptxiy2

1411,Just a rant.,i love my current job  easy work for great pay and management is friendly  but this is about an older job i quit  i worked at a wendy's before and this specific one was terrible    the building had no ac because management didn't care enough to call anyone    the lobby was closed but employees weren't allowed to sit in it even on break  what am i saying  they didn't give breaks because giving people food was so important and it clearly outweighed worker sanity    a manager was always up someone's ass about the most minor of inconveniences  one got mad at me for pointing out a poorly chopped burger in the chili   one of the managers had her boyfriend apply and come in for an  interview  that consisted of an hour of flirting with him in the lobby we weren't allowed to sit in   they heavily enforced the 'no phones' rule  i couldn't text my mom about how work was going even when there was absolutely nothing to do  they would take the phone thr second they saw it    you have time to lean  you have time to clean  yet i already cleaned everything and they still told me to clean something    they didn't want new nuggets or fries dropped until they sold what was previously made  meaning some people would get cold nuggets and fries   despite the job offer including  free food  we'd end up having to stealthily take nuggets and fries   the list could go on and on  but i'm sure that's enough ,ptjgsd

1418,Solidarity,fret deane as the      in the potential eve of the first nationwide strike in iatse's 128 year history  i'd like to share the story of the  shades of blue  wildcat strike  and what it taught me about labor power and worker solidarity   sometime around 2016   was working on season 2 of the jennifer open corrupt cop show  shades of blue  under the key carpenter are criscolo  of you ask me how the show was    don't know    didn't watch it  it just paid the rent   now  are is an old friend  and we personally get along  but he was a harness of a boss  lacking or mistakes get operation  his way or the highway  his is just to establish  are was not a lazy man  nor did he allow his crew to be lazy  he got it right and we got it on time   our relationship with the production team was a good one  smooth communication and good conditions  with problems addressed fairly quickly  his is to establish  there was no tension in the air before the strike  but a contract is a contract   and part of our contract is that we get paid  in or before pm of the following thursday  his was back in the day of physical checks being the norm  so someone is supposed to come down from production office and hand them out   and today  it's thursday at 4 pm in a stretch of busy 12 hour days  so we still have work til 6  he're all working at our benches building scenery  cutting  building  standing  when the production assistant comes down from the office with a cheery disposition that doesn't match what he's about to say    key guns  he're sorry  there has been an error in accounting and we can't print the checks this week  he'll have them for you on monday   are looked him in the eye and said  that's fine  we'll resume work on monday  and then he took his hammer out of its bolster and laid it on his workbench ceremonial  and gesture for all of us to do the same  all dozen of us followed   now  a of is just another grunt themselves  and our cheery of was now suddenly aware that something had was happening and he was in fig trouble  he ran and got a producer  who came down and tried to soothe us    am sorry about the mixed  but we do have lot of work  he're shooting tuesday    promise we're fixing the problem   are didn't budge   and when you fix the problem  we'll resume work   and then they stared at each other for a little while  and in are's eyes was  he don't do this for fun    got bills to pay  and production blinked   to for all of thursday evening  we just sat at our benches and talked  and friday morning  and friday afternoon  and wouldn't you know it  they found a way for the printer to work again on friday night  and then we picked up our hammer  and worked overcome on saturday  and we shot on tuesday  as planned  he got it right and we got it on time   and that strike  a  wildcat strike  as work stoppage without union coordination are called  taught me a crucial lesson about striking and labor power  you don't only have to strike when conditions are unbearable  you can threaten strike to  prevent  unbearable conditions  and to remind your bosses that you do their work  of they keep up their end of the deal and keep the deal good     watched the hardest working carpenter   knew lay down his hammer on a time because nbc broke the cardinal rule of the relationship  he work  you may  and he did it because he knew his crew would be behind him  and we were behind him because we knew the union would be behind us   and that's the power of a union  the bosses will try to fuck you over  it's their favorite thing to do  they do it on purpose  they do it by accident  of you're not in a union  all you can do is say  thank you sir  may   have another  of you are in solidarity with your fellow workers  you have another response on the table   you know what  luck you too   in rejecting our negotiations to curb the normalized use of long 14  16 hour days  and to bring the pay and benefits of working for streaming services in line with the rest of the industry they now dominate  the producers and studies have voted to say  luck you  to all the film crew members that make their fancy little alas possible  in october st when you get that strike authorization ballot    urge you to vote  luck you too   solidarity to all strikes and all workers ,ptpyoh
1419,Currently witnessing the process of a power-tripping boss cutting off his nose to spite his face.,my son  a college senior  is dealing with a power-tripping assistant manager at his part-time job right now  when this manager first arrived at the store  he basically told everyone in the department that despite the fact that the store is located in the heart of a major college campus  and almost all of the part-time employees are students who require flexible schedules  the shift schedules he drew up were set in stone  and that he would not tolerate anyone calling out to attempting to switch shifts  regardless of the reason  and because it was hard to find full-time employees with unlimited availability  he would threaten to cut the hours of anyone who didn't keep their pt availability as open as possible  he would then schedule all these students for long shifts on school nights and every weekend  making studying and participating in anything college-related practically impossible  needless to say  since he's been there  employee turnover has skyrocketed   anyway  my kid requested a few saturdays off work  when he was finally able to score a student ticket package for his school's home football games  and he wanted to take advantage of it in his final year of eligibility  the boss denied all of his requested dates off  and informed him that he'd be written up if he called out or switched shifts with anyone on any of those requested days  it was was if he was punishing his employee for having the gall to ask for time off  even though it was unpaid  as a part-timer  my son accrues no vacation time   so my son  who is only 2 years younger than this manager but has actually worked for the company four years longer  changed his work availability to being unavailable on saturdays  forcing his boss to take him off the saturday schedule completely for the entire football season  the manager was so furious that my son figured out a way around his time off denial  that he retaliated by cutting his hours to only one shift a week   the company as a whole prides itself on working with students' schedules  and the location my son originally worked at was very good about making sure the students they hired maintained a good work life school balance  everything worked out well for him while he was in high school and community college  and when he initially transferred to this location upon his entry into university  he has more experience than anyone else in his department  and has had nothing but glowing reviews until this new manager came along  he was recently reprimanded for wearing inappropriate footwear  which happen to be the same shoes he's worn the entire time he's been at the store and no one's ever complained about  and the manager treats him with disdain in every encounter they have  always looking for an opportunity to publicly criticize or humiliate him   what his boss doesn't seem to understand  is that he can't afford to lose employees like my son  who probably knows more about their department than he does and is relied upon heavily to help train all the new hires  so what if the kid wants a few saturdays off to enjoy the only football games he'll be able to attend in his senior year  so what if he needs his thursday evenings to work on his research project  he's been a loyal employee  he has experience in the department that no one else has  why shouldn't he be able to take time off that he's obviously entitled to   the reason this guy seems so hellbent on punishing my son is because my son used the only official power he had at that company  which was to dictate the hours and days he was available to work  he didn't request for every weekend off  just 6 saturdays during football season  but all of them were shot down  so he did the only other thing he could have done  and this guy didn't like it   needless to say  my son is now looking for another job  with the intention of quitting as soon as football season ends  all because one  my-way-or-the-highway  23 year old is too spiteful and power-hungry to realize he needs my kid more than my kid needs him ,ptyve8

1434,Rant about my job and its stupid website,i hate my job  it's half the pay of my last one  soul-suckingly boring  and the benefits are crap  i took it in the hopes that i could move out of my parents' house after covid  but it doesn't pay enough for rent anywhere around here  and rent is low here  i also took it for the health insurance because i'd be dead without glasses and have some chronic health issues  but it turns out their insurance doesn't cover any of my current doctors   i'm currently annoyed because i cannot find any information online such as how much pto accrual i get per paycheck  how much pto i currently have  or even a damn pay stub  all of this is listed in twisty tunnels on their internal website  but you can't access the website unless you're using their internet  unless i am already at work  i can't find any information at all about my health benefits  pto  pay  etc  this was a problem a couple of months ago when my first paycheck  direct deposit  was a week late and i couldn't go anywhere online to see if they'd actually sent it or how much it would be  turns out  i needed to pick up the first check in person  but no one  including in my two day orientation  mentioned it  and i couldn't find that information anywhere online  even when i can access the stupid internal website  there is no helpful information at all  just a general email address for the benefits department   two weeks into my job  i took a couple of days off to go to a wedding and specified that i wanted to take them unpaid - i didn't want to use the meager hours i'd accrued right away  but wanted to save them for when i'd really need them  the damn timekeeper used all my hours anyway - personal  sick  and vacation so i was left with 0 hours of pto and it didn't even cover everything   all i want is to know if i'll have enough pto accrued to take a christmas vacation   i desperately want to quit this job  but on top of my health issues  my parents are really stressed financially right now and i can't be a financial burden to them  it took me months of job searching to even get this damn job in the first place because there are no opportunities in this tiny town  a lot of my coworkers are also problematic  and we deal with a large houseless community which is fine  but our policies toward them are also problematic and i hate it  i hate everything about this job  but i feel like i can't quit ,ptlprc

1454,The Hypocrisy of Work-Life Balance speeches,sometimes  i wonder if these people up there  especially the c-suite or actual company owners are actually aware that their work-life balance speeches actually mean jack   there are people who do this for a living  probably hr hiring some other professional to discuss this  but it's usually infeasible for anyone at the bottomline to maintain  if only because the vast majority of groundwork is upon them  and managers only really need to decide  good ones actually actively monitor workload and reallocate it accordingly not just to the best ones  but those who can be reliably tasked to learn from it  bad ones just generally throw it to whoever's available   c-suite is even less involved  only really monitoring the rise and fluctuation of numbers  and brainstorming possible solutions based on a survey of things  people believe are causing issues  not aware that it could be biased in its entirety as well if the work culture doesn't encourage free thought   the end result is a disconnect  a bunch of leaders with a lot of free time in their hands because they know that other people will manage situations for them  and the bottom line not even able to take it because they know when they're gonna get back from a leave  someone else will be swamped with doing their fair share of groundwork   this in turn leads us back to their useless speeches  encouraging us to balance work  sure  we can do that  but since in the modern day we're so obsessed with squeezing 120  of the work effort at every turn  they start to complain when we're actually doing far below expected capacity   which leads to certain techniques of dubious quality to be used  or to be continually harassed to improve the results better   instead of hosting these speeches  why don't these guys use the budget to continually improve employee salary   i'm not exactly against work if it's good and meaningful  but nowadays  finding a job you can really pledge yourself in is like searching for a mythical unicorn in a real-world forest   they'll just tell us to balance work and family  but the moment we start focusing on family  they'll complain about the low turnout on sales  low numbers of tickets resolved  low everything  and then inevitably tell us to focus on one thing - work  or yourself   f k you man  i'm going to focus on myself  i didn't live to end up working like a cog  i'm working to live ,pts2l3

1530,"Success is not connected to hard work, or scam of corporate motivation culture", speaking in terms of logic  hard work is not just a sufficient condition  but also not the neccessary condition for success  and it's beyond your control to improve this situation  hard work is unlikely to make you rich and successful  but the probability of losing your health and family  and die sooner as a result  would become much  much higher  understanding and mitigating this risk is the highest form of success which is totally under your control ,pt4lnn
1531,How would it work?,i am happy i found this sub  as it has shown me not only that there are other people who share some of my views  but also that there is a lot more depth to those views that i had developed myself  and that there are so many crappy employers out there than i would have thought   reading every post here though  i try to think about the general overview of the sentiment of 'antiwork'  people and how the world would work if these views took hold   i know there are extremes of the type  don't work  just draw and eat fruit  or maybe they are not extremes  but i am not sure they are well thought through   while it would be nice if i didn't have to work ever again  how would i eat  how would i have shelter  how would i have sanitation  healthcare and so on  i could go to the village doctor i guess  but would she be working without compensation  and if not  what would i give her  some of my fruit  why doesn't she have her own fruit and needs mine  and if she does have her own fruit  why is she working seeing sick people   i think my main question is how does it all work if we don't work any more ,pt3l5l

1538,I'm going to start my own podcast called the wageslave rant,this will be about all the time i waste at work and on the internet  i will rant about different things  but mostly about myself  i'll do all the ranting because no one else on here wants to listen   just some advice to my fellow wagies who need to serve mr  coinblatt in order to even fucking survive      step one  start making a list of all the places i waste time every day  everyday i can i find something to fuck up     for example     1  when i get out of bed i go on facebook and play video games with my friends     2  when i go to the bathroom i go on facebook and check my friends' statuses    3  when i go to school  i go to facebook and check my friend's statuses     4  when i am eating lunch i go on facebook to mess with my friend     5  when i get home from school i go on facebook and look at my friend's status     6  when i get on the bus to work i check my friend's facebook     7  when i am on the train i check my friend's facebook     8  when i get to work i waste time playing video games and doing shit     9  when i get off work i go home and waste more time on my friends' facebook     10  when i go home i waste more time playing video games   so you can see that there is a lot that i waste time doing  now you can tell me that this list is very stupid       step 2  i have a meeting in an hour  it's going to be a long one  get up and start filling my time with something that's gonna help me when i'm having the meeting  maybe something like this       1  clean my desk     2  go to the kitchen to get something to drink     3  get a glass of water and brush my teeth     4  make sure all my shit is organized     5  check my email for any important emails     6  make sure i have the most current version of everything     7  check my facebook for status updates     8  check twitter and reddit to see if anybody is talking about something that relates to me     9  make sure my laptop is fully charged     10  go to the bathroom and check to make sure my laptop case has a good strap to wear on my back so i don't have to hold it in my hands while i walk        this list helps me focus on the important things and it helps me to prepare for the meeting  you can make one of these lists for any kind of meeting you have to have and it will help you to be more productive and focused on what's most important        step 3  i always keep a notepad in my office  when i'm working  i try to write everything down on a notepad  when i have a meeting  i get my notepad out and i start writing down things  so i don't have to be sitting at my computer looking at things on my computer  i have a notepad right in front of me  whenever i have to write something down  i take my notepad out and start writing down what i need to write down  that way  i can write faster  and i'm not having to look at my computer screen all the time  if i'm meeting somebody  i might have a different type of notepad that's different from my day to day notepad that's really small  but i still have my writing pad  maybe it has my list of phone numbers  maybe it has some notes i have to make  it could have everything from my daily notepad  when i'm having a meeting  this notepad is the notepad that i need to take notes on  it helps me to stay organized  it helps me to stay focused  it's a great little tool        step 4  make a to do list  a to do list helps you to remember all of the things you need to do  and it helps you to stay organized  if you want to really organize your schedule  write it down  for example  if you're going to be browsing reddit for an hour  write it down  if you want to call your mom  write it down  if you're having a meeting  write it down  all these things you can put on your to do list  sometimes i use a yellow pad for my to do list  and i write all the things that i need to do on there  it helps me to stay organized  whenever i have a to do list  i always have it near me  it helps me to be more organized  it helps me to be more focused on my goals and my purpose        step 5  buy a planner  a planner is something that helps you to stay organized  it helps you to stay focused  it helps you to be organized  if you want to really organize your schedule  buy yourself a planner  sometimes you just buy yourself a small planner and add pages as you need  a planner could have everything on it  a planner could have a list of important things  a planner could have a list of events that you need to have on a certain day  if you want to really organize your schedule  buy yourself a planner  it helps you to stay organized  it helps you to stay focused  it helps you to be organized  it's a great little tool        step 6  find your purpose  the sixth step to help you stay organized is to find your purpose  why are you doing what you're doing  what do you want to get out of it  how do you want to feel when you're finished  do you want to feel better  do you want to feel more fulfilled  do you want to feel more alive  find out why you're doing what you're doing  what's your purpose  when you know your purpose  you'll be able to set goals to get you there  find out why you're doing what you're doing  find your purpose  write down everything you want  this will help you get what you want  when you know what you want to get out of it  you'll be able to set goals        step 7  set goals  the seventh step to help you stay organized is to set goals  this will help you to stay organized  it will help you to stay focused  it will help you to be more organized  what are your goals  what are your personal goals  what are your work goals  what are your education goals  this will help you stay focused  this will help you stay organized  this will help you to set and achieve your goals  write them down  keep them in front of you  take a picture of them and put them on your refrigerator  the sooner you set a goal  the more likely you are to accomplish it  write it down  tackle it head-on  you can take it one step at a time  you don't have to think about everything at once  write down your goals  think about your personal life  your professional life        all because we need to take this slavery seriously to get crumbs from mr  coinblatt    capitalism has failed ,ptb2zt

1540,What should I do?,i worked for the state in a group home for disabled people for 10 years  understaffing leading to mandatory double shifts was always a bit of an issue but the pandemic had made it much worse to the point that it was every shift so i quit a month ago because it isn't possible for human beings to work 18 hours a day    today i called the retirement fund office to see how cashing out works and if i should  it turns out that they'd pay me out  7300 after taxes  that's not that much money but i felt like i won the lottery since i'm reaching the end of my savings and will have to figure out a source of income pretty soon  i also may have about another  6000 coming in from other sources   13 300 isn't going to make me rich but it'll keep me going a while while i decide what to do with my life next   but then i had my exit interview with hr over the phone  i told them they have to do better and hr lady asked me if i'd be willing to come back  i asked if she was sure since i didn't give a 2 week notice or anything and she said yeah  i said i'd think about it but i don't know if i'd want to work for such immoral people  she said she'd get back to me in a day or two   after discussing it some  i'm leaning toward going back  it's a sweet job besides the mandations  i worked overnights when all the residents were sleeping so my job was mostly laying on a couch watching tv or doing whatever i want  i'm not as worried about the mandations because i used to have a weird fear of calling in to work but now i have no problem with it and would make it clear that i'm not coming back in for my own shift if i haven't had at least 12 hours off like i was for a couple months before i quit   i've got some thinking to do but i doubt i'd find a better overall job for me so this is how i'm leaning  what do you think ,ptf13c

1548,Two mentalities,i think there are two mentalities in general when it comes to making money   1  when i help my boss  they give me money  i earn the money   2  when my boss exploits me  they owe me money  they pay for stealing my time    -   i think there is a strong shift at the moment from 1 to 2  and the reason for that seems rather simple   let me tell you my story   when i was younger i worked in a small store after school  when there were no customers i felt bad and did something productive like cleaning etc  i felt bad for being at work without doing anything     later i worked in a school as a caretaker and i did my best to help the school as much as i could  when there wasn't really anything to do  i grabbed a broom and sweeped the schoolyard    now i work in an office  when i started here many years ago  i wanted to see my mouse pad burn and my keyboard melt by the sheer speed of my hands  i felt the urge to help my colleagues and my boss as much as possible   but that has changed over the years    i don't feel bad anymore for sitting in front of my work pc and working rather slow    -   i was thinking about what has changed  and why    it is quite easy to tell honestly  it has nothing to do with the amount of money i earn  it is the way my boss values and appreciates me as a person and my work   during my time at the store i felt like an important part of it  my boss and his wife often praised me for how accurate i did everything  the wife sometimes even brought me something nice to eat during the later hours like a steak    the same is true for my work during the time at the school  i felt appreciated  it felt like my boss  my colleagues and i were working together to give the children at school a good time  it even wasn't rare that my boss said something like  hey today you are driving to xyz  right  here take this money and on your way back make a stop at the store bakery to buy something nice to eat for you and the collegues   coming from such a background i felt the same in the office for a rather long time  except there wasn't appreciation from my boss at all  i always thought that he is stessed and has no time because of his work  but turned out it simply isn't true  he never appreciates anything  no one of us workers  instead we only get to hear what we have done wrong and how dumb we are  so over the years the motivation to help him with his work became smaller and smaller  oh  and sure  our boss is perfect  he can't make mistakes  when we did something exactly like he said and it is wrong the only reason for that is that we weren't listening or understanding    so instead of feeling appreciated i feel exploited   -  during my first two jobs we worked together to make people happy  our goal was the same   but now the goal has changed  happiness isn't valued here at all  money is   i don't feel like i need to earn my money anymore  i feel like my boss owes me money for stealing my time and exploiting me    i am not happy  my boss is not happy  none of my colleagues are  everybody has only one thing in mind  money  since happiness doesn't exist anymore   -  it was fun to see people smile  it was good to feel appreciated  we were a good team   now everything feels kind of bitter  as if we work against each other   -  is it really that hard to understand  make your workers feel appreciated and important  not with money only  but with gestures too  and for gods sake  greet them back when they greet you   otherwise your workers will exploit you just as much as you exploit them   even if your goal is money only  it will pay to be nice to your workers  it's a win-win situation   please  dear bosses  it is in your hands to spread happiness and prevent bitterness to happen  it will make people feel like they earn money for helping you and not like you owe them money for exploiting them ,pt33nx

1602,Why is it worth living if we're forced to work?,after joining the workforce straight  out college i've been the most depressed and hopeless in my entire life  i got a good paying stable job in my field of study doing something i'm passionate about  with alright coworkers and a decent work culture  i did everything right  i was earning a decent amount of money  i made my friends and family proud  and was a respectable member of society with their own income and prospects ahead   but why did i feel so empty and hollow at the end of the day  after the first week  the feeling of enthusiasm in a new experience and advancement in my life quickly faded and i was left with the reality that i was trapped  stuck in this eternal limbo of constant repetition for weeks  months  years on end  because that's what awaits me  sure there was variation from day to day on the job and chances for advancement  but i struggled with this overhanging feeling of dread and i quickly became depressed in the fact that this is my fully realized life  i began to resent my career and view work as the oppressive anticlimactic mundane repetitive meaningless drain on my life it was turning into    in my head i was constantly focusing on the mental math on how to best partition my days so that i can enjoy myself outside of work thinking things like   i have 24hrs each day  i spend 8 at work and  on a good day  8 asleep  that's 16hrs  that leaves 8 hrs for myself  but i spend an hour on commute time and about 30min checking work emails and texts  so in reality i only have 6  hours to myself on a given work day  and even less considering i still have 1 hr workouts  30 min showers  and cook clean for on average 2hrs for my family back at home  so minus the home and body maintenance i only have about 2 hrs for myself  consequently   i began to drop allot of my passions and hobbies  because they just weren't fun knowing that i had to time crunch them with the feeling of annoyance at having to mind the clock and monitor myself  and i couldn't get more time by cutting other areas of my life because i don't want to let myself go by not going to the gym and not showering or by  just leaving chores pile up at home  i couldn't see my partner and friends through the work week  because not only were they working also and rarely our schedules aligned  i was also too tired to want to go out  and when i did i was thinking about how i'd have to drag myself out of bed the next morning  it felt so bleak knowing that even though weekends were the only opportunities to hang out with ppl i could only at most hang out 2 times  which was a stark shift from college and school  sure i could be friends with coworkers  but although they were nice i don't think they or i were looking for new friends  and even if we were  we were focusing on working those 8 hrs not  becoming friends    i quit at the first reasonable excuse i could find that wouldn't hurt my relationship with my employers  which just happened to be getting assaulted and threatened with violence by a coworker  ever since then i've been contemplating whether that lifestyle is worth the mental degradation i experience while living in  i understand that i come from a very privileged position  not having the strong motivator of paying expensive bills  but i don't want to ever return to that  i didn't feel fulfillment in the money i was making or the things  experiences i bought with them  and i don't think i ever will    i hate this work lifestyle  i hate the system that normalized the deterioration friendships and passions ppl have outside their jobs  and i hate those ppl who say to me  it's not that bad  just because they enjoy themselves devoting their lives to the work gods    sorry for the rant,ptbxm8
1603,Quit my job in March. Would rather die than go back to work.,i  25m  quit my finance job in march after having panic attacks in the middle of the night about work responsibilities  i was deeply unhappy with my job - didn't like the environment people  despised the predatory industry  but more than anything i felt like i was being robbed of my life  nothing was enjoyable anymore - wake up  go to work  come home  eat  sleep  repeat  i don't know how anyone does it    quitting was cathartic and was without a doubt one of the best feelings of my life  it felt like i had finally taken control over my life  i flew to mexico with my girlfriend as soon as my two weeks were up to celebrate  for a while after i quit i felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders and like i could just take some time to reset and figure out what to do next  now  over 6 months later  i've come to the realization that i would fully rather be dead and done with this shitty world than spend the next 45 years working doing some dumb shit i hate to be able to barely scrape by while the world around us burns  i haven't applied to a single job and don't plan on it  but i don't have the means to support myself for too much longer    i'm tempted to just check out now  i have no hope for humanity and the direction of the planet  and i am fully convinced things only get worse from here on out  i've lived during the most uniquely prosperous time in all of human history and i'm glad i got to experience it  but after seeing what there is to offer i've made the calculated decision that life is not inherently worth living  i am disgusted by the common man's complete disregard for the planet and fellow humans  and i don't care to be a part of it  i don't want to exist to generate profits  i want to be left the fuck alone  but maybe such a luxury can only truly be found in death ,pt7fp9

1613,To Quit or Not to Quit?,i m in need of some advice or encouragement i guess  i ve been working at my first job for about a year now and lo and behold i want to quit  i work as a customer service rep  taking calls all day  as most people working in cs know  it sucks  customers are rude  moody  and take their issues out on you  among other things  another aspect of the job that sucks is the constant monitoring and surveillance  i basically work at a call center  even though my job refuses to call it that  so we have to be in certain statuses and if we change status or are in a status for too long we get a warning message  we have certain expectations like how long a call should be  how long we can take afterwards to log the call or  if there is a bigger issue  make a request which takes at least 5 minutes  keep in mind they want our after call time to be about 2 minutes or less depending on how long you ve been working  for the most part  imo these metrics are out of our control  also  having these metrics leads to more mistakes because instead of focusing on getting the issue solved and sending requests to the right department  we re focused on our timing  since starting i ve taken on more and more responsibility and am always told i am one of the best resources on the team yet i ve applied for a trainer position multiple times and each time they offer the position to less experienced coworkers  meanwhile all i m told is to not give up  to not feel discouraged  and to please apply for the next one   who wouldn t feel discouraged  i m over it  every day before work i dread taking phone calls  every day after work i am drained and have no energy to do anything else  there are always so many changes and the work environment is becoming more and more strict  and ofc i don t get paid enough to deal with all this bs  not even close to a living wage  that being said  i like that i can wfh and don t have to commute  but idk if i ll be able to find a wfh job  i don t have anything lined up currently either so there that issue  i m clearly very over this job and have noticed that on days where i work i am in a terrible  depressed mood  i d love to hear your thoughts  if you made it this far  thank you for reading ,psorr0

1641,Story: I was brought to a poor area in Thailand to experience what a really hard life was like,my uncle owns a home in the rural and poor isaan area in thailand  i was invited to stay with him for a couple of weeks by my parents  in order to get some life experience  and see how good my own life was in comparison    at first i was shocked to learn many places didn't have running water and toilet paper and that people slept on rugs on the concrete floor  sometimes 7 people in a room and washed clothes by hand    after a while however i realized that it was perfectly fine to soap up and them wash using scoops of water  squat while taking a dump and wash butt with water  even sleeping on the concrete made sense as it was nice and cool    it was always warm and sunny so no need for fancy clothes  i could pick an array of wild berries and fruits right out of the jungle and the local gardens were all bountiful and lush  the locals caught frogs and other animals and cooked them and there where small convenience stores and food wagons everywhere if you wanted a  very  cheap meal    i had been told how gruelling and hard working the rice fields where  and while that's true  a lot of it had become mechanized and the harvest season wasn't all that long  so for the rest of the year they were straight up chillin  the village tended to come together and help each other in the rice paddies too so they got the job done quick   i found that most of the working age men and women only worked long enough to have enough money to go back home and chill  some worked a couple of month construction in bangkok or a factory or whatever then straight back home to chill for a couple of month etc    if someone needed to drive in to the big city to shop they could always borrow or rent the car from that one guy who had one    medicine was socialised  to my big surprise and the old lady next door paid a couple of dollars to fill her insulin prescription    i know because i drove her to surin town to pick it up   i started hanging out with a group of locals and none of us  including me had any money but we all got by just fine  we scrounged up money for beer and bbq  drove down to the lake to drink and listen to music and to eventually fall asleep on the roofed teak veranda  while money was tight it always seemed to work itself out  there was always someone who had some or could get a few bath   no my parents didn't send me cash and my uncle had a meagre pension   it was supposed to serve as a wake up call for me but it only made me question who really had the best quality of life    the slow and leisurely pace of life out there in the village felt magical to me and being back home working in an office has never quite been the same since then ,pt1vd9

1647,"Running errands is FULL-TIME work alredy. Between cooking, cleaning, walking 10,000 steps a day, printing &amp; filling out various forms, calling call centres, going to the post office - how the HELL does ANYONE have time to work full-time exactly?", who the hell has time for work anyway   i'm an office worker  currently wfh because of covid   all stores and businesses in my country are open 9am-5pm  same as my business hours  everyone's business hours are the same  the post office  government offices etc - it's all open while you work  i can't run most errands after work   i have to do them surreptitiously  in between my work tasks  this is only feasible because i'm in covid19 lockdown and working from home   i have no idea how others are doing this  i'm childfree  and have no idea how people with kids run 2x-3x time as many errands  and still manage to work for a living  i have no idea how people with chronic illnesses  which require regular doctor visits and tests  find time to work and get medical care     here are examples of stuff i've been doing in the past 2 months     - stores are closed because of covid19  gotta buy something essential at a hardware store  you have to use  click and collect  when can you collect  that's right  9am-5pm      - did you select delivery instead of store pickup   the parcel may arrive at the post office and you gotta pick it up  and yes  they close at 5pm  when i finish working  sometimes i hook my laptop to 4g and walk to the post office  with the laptop open  so that i'll still be online on chat for work  this is super inconvenient    -  dentist appointment   - booking on the phone  going there for the treatment    - booking a dentist appointment for complex work requires a sedationist in my case  so i gotta call the  sedationist  too    -  the sedationist wants a form from the dentist  before they'd take me as a patient  so i gotta call the dentist's office again  but the dentist is not in today to write the form  so his receptionist tells me that she'd give me a callback tomorrow  and she doesn't  so i need to chase it up and call both the sedationist and dentist and arrange for the appointment    - the dentist writes a  prescription to fill  the pharmacy is open late - after work  but there's an error in the prescription so they won't give me the med  i gotta call the dentist office again  during work hours  and then i have to take the revised prescription to the pharmacy again    -  the real estate agency needs me to sign a form  to get access to their portal and pay my rent  i can't go to officeworks to use their printer and scanner  they close at 5pm  i go to the real estate agency  i sign the form and they say i'd get an email from them with a login to the portal to pay my rent    - the email never comes  i call the real estate agency  they put me on hold  15 mins later they say they can't find my form  and i have to come in again    - i had my name legally changed so i have to provide name change and  proof of identity documents  to half a dozen companies and a dozen government agencies  despite uploading my docs as instructed  paypal won't change my name within  3-5 business days  as promised  and their chatbots are useless - i have to call their customer service  and navigate through many menu options to sort it out    - my internet provider won't update my name either till i  bring the documents to their store  open 9-5 ofc  btw  utility bills here are considered a proof of identity docs  and required  for many things  i e  a home loan  that's why it's important the internet bill needs to have the correct name    - i moved house so there's  packing   removalists  cleaners  unpacking  new furniture assembly   everything is sold in ikea state  pre-assembled  removalists were 2 5 hours late and by the time they arrive  there was rain  so we had to reschedule    -  routine blood tests  gotta go to the clinic early to get my blood drawn  they open at 8am  i assumed i'd lose 1h of sleep  come in early and get this errand done before work  and get back home by 9am  so did everyone else in the long  long queue outside  we all look tired  i don't make it inside by 9 45am and end up late for work    - remember when i bought some stuff online  the shower head arrived  but it doesn't fit my tap  so i have to  go to the hardware store and return it  within x days    - there's some indiscrepancies in my power bill so i had to  call my energy provider    -  buying groceries  fresh fruits and veggies require a couple of visits to the grocery store a week    -  laundry   - washing  hanging outside in the sun  saves power  money  reduces environmental impact of dryers  takes more time though    -  cleaning the house  changing sheets once a week  vaccuming the carpet     -  cooking  cheap lunches with reasonable nutritional value  washing the dishes after  taking out the rubbish    -  walking 10 000 steps a day and exercising 150 mins a week  the recommend minimum as per doctors to maintain a healthy lifestyle  especially as a sedentary office worker     -  calling emailing overseas relatives  regularly  i feel bad for not not being diligent enough about tis one     -  keeping in touch with friends    -  doing my taxes   - still procrastinating on that one  it's due next month      i've been doing at least half that shit while i'm supposed to be working  i'm obviously tired  disgruntled and hopeless  i end up snapping at various service givers and call centres  for being unable to do the paperwork i need them to at a timely fashion  it's not their fault  i guess  i am less friendly and fun to hang out with  i get upset with friends and family for no good reason  other than the general frustration of life   sometimes i manage to work with my laptop on the bus  on my way to various stores  clinics or offices  but it's quite an operation to arrange  can't be attending any zoom calls during   i don't know how people develop hobbies  you do all of the above plus a full-time job  and you have zero energy left to knit  paint  woodwork or learn a language instrument  staring blankly and passively a tv is the only option ,psx54z

1670,What kind of BS,alright - i work at a privately owned small business that works with the federal government  the owners of this business have been at it for 20  years - i ve been here for almost 5  doing work for the feds and the private clients that only i can do within this company  fast forward to last year   found out that our employers never had a contract with the feds on services and equipment we provided  wtf  so  the feds pull all services we provided due to another company suing them  etc  lost a lot of money from that fuck up on the employers part  1st red flag    2nd red flag - annual review was up on april of 2020  was notified i wasn t receiving a raise due to the account being pulled and covid  okay  i understood that  due to covid and their stupid mistake  sure  i can handle that this year  not really  but whatever - i have a wife and child  not two weeks later the boss and spouse have two brand new vehicles - i mean we are talking top of the line truck of 2020 and suv w  aftermarket add ons after the purchase  this was around the time of the ppp loans    3rd red flag - that same year  2020  they get their roof redone  whole house painted  and decide that they need copper lined gutters because it will look beautiful on their house  so they spent over  200 000 in one year on themselves  no raises for anyone in the company throughout 2020  okay  let s see how it works this year  fast forward to 2021   4th red flag - i disclose to my employer that i have another child on the way  this was about 3 weeks before my annual review  come time for the review i don t get any raise  but we hire two new people a short while later  was told the company couldn t afford a raise for anyone this year but we can hire 2 more folks  right   5th red flag - learned that the spouse of the boss purchased a brand new tractor and an enclosed trailer to haul it in  but no raise    all of this and the company keeps stacking on procedures and processes with no compensation    i mean - are these red flags or am i not reading these events correctly  from what i see the employer is pocketing deserved raises to buy themselves a bunch of shit  am i wrong here    anyway  i am very close to leaving  just wanted to share what i have been witnessing at work ,psqh15

1673,Despite the circumstances...,i have been reading through this sub for a bit now  in no way is this post to discredit the way any of you feel  what many of you think about capitalism american society is perfectly reasonable and i agree with some of the main topics frequently discussed here  however  because i care about people i wanted to write this out as a reminder  no matter how much you hate the system and or the way it works  you inevitably only have two options  play the game or execute your exit strategy    thems the facts homies    of course  advocate for what what you believe is right  but don't fool yourself by believing advocacy can turn your situation around  make your voice heard as best you can with your wallet and ballot    if you stay to play  become an expert on the strategy   develop valuable skills  become a financial expert  develop the drive for upward mobility    if you plan on making your exit  learn enough to earn enough to make your exit    be the change you want to see in the world  be a better boss than the ones in your past  stand up against mistreatment as an employee for yourself and others  you can't trust anyone else to do it for you  my hope is that despite how disillusioned we are about the current state of our existence we can facilitate positive discussion on how to improve our lives    tldr  if you are going to stay and play might as well be good at the game  if you want to exit then all the more power to you ,pst922

1706,A new perspective on the worst job ever,i was the most productive employee in the building for 2 5  years at the call center for the dmv  know this because they had boards all around the call center showing who was the most productive  all day   i didn't do any of this because i care about being up that high   the call center was based on piece rate so it was more lucrative for me to learn the system  then excel in this system   i was written up for wearing a sweatshirt and also  avoiding phone calls  when i was the top employee   i basically talked to 0 people   i wouldn't even look at people in the hall or in the lunch room   my job was to get in  work  and leave asap   the turn-over was so ridiculous getting to know people seemed like a waste because the chances you would be there after 3 months were about 3   they used to have us train people   these new employees would be in your cubicle for about 2 hours a day   they wanted you to take your time and teach them everything  slow down  show them the ropes  etc   sounds like its not bad except slowing down meant you'd be getting paid less   they should have compensated you for training  but nope   you wound up getting paid less   i came up with the idea to tell them  i didn't feel comfortable having training  knowing with hr and everything they couldn't even ask what made be feel uncomfortable so that eventually got me out of that   the building didn't allow any  cell phones  well  unless you were a manger  or in it because they had good excuses i guess   if you were late even 5  minutes for the month your pay was docked for the next pay check and it was a considerable hit  like 20   if you had to call off for any reason  your next 2 checks were screwed   the beginning for the end for me was during the beginning of the pandemic   we never worked for home nor was that ever  a possibility   my co-worker that worked next to contracted covid  only the superiors didn't notify me for 2 days  friday evening  until my shift was almost over     i was called into the office to talk to the big wig were i was forced to take mandatory quarantine   i was  offered  to use my vacation time but i explained my vacation time was already locked up  ya know  for vacation   i was then told i wouldn't be paid for it   i asked the building manager if i should be applying for unemployment  but was indirectly told they would fight me for it   at that point i figured i didn't have too much to lose  even though i'm married and have two kids   i told her it was basically a slap in the face on multiple levels  and that i was literally wasting my life there for the past 3 years after being so productive   besides the pay hit  i hate the job so it was a blessing   thankfully i never contracted covid so it was an additional vacation   when it was time for vacation they asked me if i was leaving the state   i told them i was   they told me i was no  approved  for this vacation that was actually approved 5  months previous   i asked them  well  what is going to happen when i don't come in next week     the same manager that purposely neglected to tell me for 2 days that the  person sitting next to me had covid was like    what are you going to do  call off every day   i answered with   i don't know  maybe     why would you do that    well  that would be my prerogative     at that point i just returned to my desk and to my cubicle   i walked out after grabbing what little things i would keep there   i wound up going on vacation  calling off the days i needed to   after 10 days of quarantine i got a call from the supervisor that i was fired   i hung up on her   i then proceeded to get a better job that pays more from home and sniped 3 of the good employees from that job ,psnbcg

hopefully be a cautionary tale about getting out of such a toxic environment when you see the signs   worked at my last company  industrial manufacturing warehouse environment  for three years  the good  i displayed excellence and diligence consistently and got promoted three times in three years-- with pay increases each time  my most recent role was shipping and receiving supervisor  got a lot of experience under my belt   it was challenging and rewarding work  they do have great longevity in their business model with sustainability at the core of their vision and a versatile product reaching a wide range of clients and markets  the ceo is a great guy  my manager was nice and very often went to bat for me    so far so good  until this last year got progressively worse  i was with them through 2 acquisitions name changes  lots of layoffs  lots of restructuring  positions being dissolved  others being created  no outlined job performance   i saw a good amount of people that were paid poorly  trained poorly and treated poorly  several individuals were fired for nothing more than the fact that the company either needed a fall guy for a company wide oversight and or they wanted to appear that they were following their safety protocols to the letter    one gentleman was even given the responsibility of shop supervisor for almost a year while they strung him along month after month  talk after talk about how the company couldn't do it yet  at  17 hr  way less than his subordinates made--some making north of  20 hr  and no official promotion    no standardized training for any job since the multiple acquisitions  everything is just passed on by word of mouth  they are working on that now  creating sop's  swim lanes for each role  learning management software for training  etc  but while i was there  it made meeting expectations very difficult when there were no clearly delineated guidelines or procedures for doing your job  very mix and match  trial and error in their processes   they frequently made individuals do about 2-3 people's worth of work and punished them for mistakes being made and were unemphatic when those team members were burnt out physically and otherwise  very high turnover rate  revolving door of temps  all that being said  i know they are working on some of this stuff but some of it shows no signs of improving in the near future  i enjoyed my time there for the most part  even though i saw these things happening to others and was empathetic  but it's a little different when it happens to you  i had very little training  and very little support from my manager  nice as they were    i made the very bottom tier of pay for all my responsibilities  19 hr--researched a little and found out  21 was average for my role but didn't complain because my wife and 2 kids had everything we needed and i was not the most experienced candidate for my role when i was hired   they took a chance on me because of how i'd proven myself in the past    my team shrunk over that year from 3  to 2  to just me when one guy got fired for texting while driving a forklift and the other guy got poached by another department without any warning or plans to replace him   can't blame him though  he had been there for 10 years and he was getting paid  17 hr---same as current entry level guys and the other dept was in desperate need and offered him several  more per hour   i was singled out for my mistakes even when an issue showed holes in every department  with my manager taking every opportunity on teams meetings to emphasize our department's  my  portion of the failure  some sales reps were pissed too because all they could see was the fact they had to face an angry customer and had no empathy for the situation actually going down in the shop--even though i had let them know   also it is very  everyone for themselves  with lots of finger pointing--not conducive to a team atmosphere at all  and ultimately i was let go because of a gross misrepresentation in regard to safety and the company's desire to appear to have a safety culture  even though i was possibly the most safety conscious person in the shop  i was told i take safety too seriously     i was doing a job for 3 people  trying to stay afloat  naturally  i was in the warehouse more  doing more physical work than normal  runnin and gunnin as they say  i didn't  injure  my back  per se   it was just tight  tense and hurting a little  took an ibuprofen  told my fellow supervisor and kept working  pain went away  next morning it's still a little tight tense  i knew everything going on in my department--because i was the whole damn department--and i knew i could afford to call in based on the current workload  called in  told my manager the issue  they asked if the back stuff happened at work  i said if i had to guess  i think it did but i want sure  could have been how i slept just getting exasirbated by the massive work load  next thing i know i get a conference call with my manager  hr and safety saying i'm terminated for not reporting the  incident  on the previous day  per their zero tolerance safety policy that i had agreed to  the policy states that this zero tolerance is for  deliberately avoiding reporting an accident  incident or injury  there was nothing deliberate about this  didn't even cross my mind as something to report  and i did tell my fellow supervisor--albeit i wasn't his direct report--because my manager worked out of a different facility and was never at my site  tried to fight it with my manager  hr and even the ceo  no wiggle room with the first 2  and the ceo was on vacation--can't fault him for that  like i said  he is a great guy and he deserves time off with his family like we all do   the biggest slap in the face was a week later  scrolling through indeed  looking for a new job and all  and seeing the job posting for my exact job description  different title--real sly guys  posted as of 3 weeks ago  as in  they were looking to replace me a whole 2 weeks before the  incident  not a conspiracy theorist but  something doesn't add up there lol   cherry on top you ask  the salary offered was up to  70k a year   that translates to roughly  36 hr  to do a job i was doing for  19  aaaaaggghhhh    hoping for a better opportunity around the corner    been almost three weeks now

1744,My internship has apparently never had someone set boundaries.,i'm currently working an unpaid internship because i have to have two internships before i can complete me degree  i previously worked an internship with a small stipend and had a fantastic experience there  there  i did just about everything i was asked to do and genuinely cared about the organization   at my current position  i'm massively resentful of the lack of compensation  but i push through by telling myself i'm learning from the experience  today  however  my supervisor asked me to do a very repetitive office work task  if i had to estimate  there are about 200 hours of work available on this task  which is more than my total time required for the internship  i've been doing this task for about 1 4 of my time here already  but apparently that wasn't enough  i basically said   this isn't beneficial for my education  please don't plan to have this problem entirely resolved by intern labor   my supervisor didn't acknowledge this until i was already gone for the day  at which point she wrote a lengthy email describing it as  one of the most inappropriate and disrespectful things she's encountered in her professional life   i guess an unpaid intern having boundaries could come off as disrespectful if you've never encountered it before  regardless  we have a meeting with a mediator from my university this week  i'm absolutely not going back to that environment where i'm not respected  and i think if i play my cards right  i can convince my university not to send another inter to that organization in the future   tl dr - unpaid internships are bullshit  they're mega bullshit when you're just given busy work that isn't even educational ,ps8j2w

1759,Reposting process to get sick leave at Amazon (sorry about the profanity I’ve removed it),i work at amazon  and being sick is a nightmare  and not even with just from the need for a negative covid test now   when sick  you have to   1 call the department of disability and leave services  which is entirely unconnected to your buildings human resources  and is mostly made up of overseas phone operators  the majority of whom actually cannot speak proper english  2 arrange for a leave of absence  and tell them not only how long you are planning on being sick  but also the exact date when you will be returning   remember to consult your horoscope  3 go in to the doctor asap  and get checked out  get a doctors note  and ask the doctor to fill out and sign a three page form provided by the amazon disability and leave services detailing how you are sick  doesn t matter if it s a private or embarrassing thing  how bad it is  and they have to note that it does prevent you from being capable of working  additionally  the doctor must then give their own prediction on how long you will be sick  how they are treating it  and when you will be back to work and healthy  4 but wait  there s a problem  you don t actually have the unique three page form when you go in to the doctor  because the disability leave services won t email it to you for another 24-48 hours after you first put in your leave of absence notice   and it s not a form you can just print out prior from a previous leave  it has your name  the date  your prophesied date of return to work  etc  5 so  you must go back in to the doctors office a day or two later  drop off the form at the front desk and leave instructions and an apology on behalf of your overbearing disability and leave services team  only to learn that your doctor from that case won t be in for another week or so  6 you must wait  all the while receiving automated emails from amazon dls to turn in your paperwork or they ll disapprove your leave and get you fired for using all your personal time  7 when you do get it back and turn it in  you will have to make a follow up email with your case number to the dls  because they don t bother checking your file to see if you ve uploaded the documents  they just leave you on the  refusing to turn in paperwork  probably trying to scam us into free vacation  list until they get an email saying you did what you were supposed to and what they have been demanding  8 the leave gets approved  two weeks later  and you must go to the human resources at your building to ask them to put in a notice because the dls  who  once again  are completely unconnected to your hr  and do not communicate or share records  etc  you must ask them to put in a notice for your personal time  which was deducted because the dls deducts your time until they decide to approve your leave request  you must ask that that all be refunded before you are fired for having -40 hours of unpaid personal time or what have you  9 you will continue getting automated emails for some time  until you get one saying thank you for continuous work at the great amazon  how would you rate our broken english speaking team of phone operators who read off a list and can t patch you through to the case manager because they weren t given his number in the first case   the end ,ps8ujs

1773,I filed an OSHA report on my company and I was surprised by the reaction of those I told.,my work does not care about the well-being of its employees  i ve been there for almost 2 years and i have witnessed blatant safety violations that have become expected of us to commit in order to achieve peak production goals   i work occasionally in my company s warehouse in order to pull supplies needed to construct products our customers requested  these products are on shelves that are up to 20 feet high  the problem is that we have 1 person certified to operate our forklift  the coo of my company and basically a step up from my manager   who  more often than not  cannot make time to retrieve things on top of the shelves  so it s come expected for us  especially my manager  to climb these shelves with nothing other than a stairs that go up maybe 2 3rds the way  so we basically have to hopefully have enough balance and stamina to pull ourselves onto these shelves without any sort of safety equipment and if we fell it would be at least 20 feet straight to a concrete floor    on top of that  the temperatures over the summer have been especially brutal this year  felt about 100 for most of the season  and our warehouse does not have air  only a few fans that really just blow all the hot air down to the ground  it s gotten so hot that two of my coworkers have thrown up due to over heating and over exertion    two weeks ago was the last straw for me  my manager was made to climb onto the shelves and he injured his leg and had a limp for a few days  this isn t the first time he s injured himself doing this  but he s extremely loyal to a fault and when asked to jump he usually responds with  how high   and even if he injured himself more severely  the higher ups at the company have proven they don t care after another employee fell off a truck dock and hurt himself pretty badly  the first thing my company asked him was if he was going to sue or not     but if my manager wasn t going to put his foot down about the unsafe conditions i decided to take it onto my own    so i filed the complaint  haven t heard anything yet  and i ve been keeping it kinda quiet  especially around work since they are openly republican and because it s a smaller company so if i made it known i filed a complaint  the bosses know me personally so there s a high chance they would begin targeting me  and the few people i ve told all had the same question    aren t you worried that this would make you unhirable if you look elsewhere   is that really where we are in the us  it s now completely taboo to worry about your safety of you and your fellow workers   is our culture that obsessed with the idea of being a boss that we allow ourselves to be so exploited that our safety is no longer a concern   it really baffles me that people would rather dehumanize themselves rather than admitting something is wrong    oh well  i at least hope this at least will light a fire under my boss  ass for them to reevaluate their business ethic and it did feel good to be naming my boss specifically in the complaint  especially since he unreal standards  routinely expects us to get 40 hours of work done in two business days  so if anything fuck you boss man ,psn0tq

1784,Have you ever noticed that many owners of companies never talk to us?,the owners of the companies we work for never seem to come down from their high places offices  to talk to us  you'd think that hiring us meant we have a place in their work  goals  and ambitions  but wouldn't it be better for the owners to get to know each worker  wouldn't it be better for the owner to discuss future plans on production with you  or to ask you how you are doing with your station  better yet  wouldn't a good owner be right there with you helping you with any task and also passionate about helping   i've had 8 jobs and every single one the owner usually just manages from their office desk  and occasionally comes out to berate people  it just seems odd that if these owners were truly invested and idk caring about their company and the human beings in it that maybe they'd actually be in the trenches too   they always say we come in and work as if to  collect a check  but god dang it seems like they are the ones who truly  collect a check ,psadrf

1804,Gather around children and let me tell you a story about working.,i am 57 years old  and i started working in 1976 when i was 12 years old  mowing lawns  shoveling snow  baby-sitting  and delivering newspapers  it was ingrained in me at a very early age that you needed to work to succeed in life  my siblings and i all looked up to our father as a role model and truly great man  he worked the same job for 30 years    when my father turned 55 his employer  a large semi-conductor manufacturer  forced him out with threats of losing his pension and retirement if he didn't  take the buy-out   he was heart-broken because he had spent his entire working life devoted to his employer  towing the company line and working his fingers to the bone to provide for his family  after he left the company he took a series of low paying jobs and thankfully he eventually found one that made him happy  we were all ecstatic and until his death a few years ago his later years were filled with time for his family and his hobbies   ironically  i completely ignored the cautionary tale that i had seen unfold right before my eyes  and so i too devoted 25 years of my life to a  family-owned  company where i worked tirelessly up to 70 hours a week  all in the name of success and advancement  until one day shortly after covid began i was brought into an office and told that my position was being eliminated  which of course was a lie  the new  assistant  that i'd been training for months was replacing me  i was handed a check and an nda to sign   i was 55 years old   in my panic i set about to replicate the exact fucking thing that had been my father and my downfall  i wanted to get back on a  career path  as soon as possible  i tried a couple of retail managerial jobs  which during covid were a nightmare  and eventually settled on job managing some warehouse employees for a fraction of what i had made previously  my wife and i made it work  and downsized to a smaller house and got rid of our leased cars  my thoughts however continued to return to a career and advancement   it wasn't until two weeks ago  when i ran into a former co-worker who told me that he'd quit his high-paying  high stress job to return to cooking the line that i realized that i was done chasing a non-existent safety net  i am currently preparing an exit strategy from my current job so that my wife and i can keep health insurance but i can downsize my work life  i know how much cash i need to make to pay bills and set some aside for retirement  but i am planning on spending the rest of my working life in a low-stress job  with no career advancement potential   the moral of this story is that your employer is not your family  nor your friend  nor your ally  they have one reason for existing  to make the owners wealthy  you are a replaceable cog in the machine  for 25 years i ignored this reality and when i finally came around it was so freeing    free yourself ,psj3oq

1846,"I find it absolutely wild that I must wake up each day, go to a pointless job, to come back and just about cover the bill payments. The world is cooking to death and we're likely to see horrors never before faced by humanity.",sorry if this doesn't belong here mods  but i feel like this needs to be said  i know other users have touched on it before    i must preface this post with a few facts  i live in the uk  i rent  i live month to month with very little left over at the end of the month  i support 3 people on my wage alone  i have a career  though it's extremely underpaid   for identity purposes  i won't say what my career is  however my career is unfortunately one of those menial 'nothing' jobs  where nobody would really notice if it didn't exist  i'm 32 and have been in my career path since graduating university nearly 10 years ago  the first 5 years of it  for the most part  i loved it  or at least tolerated it as being 'normal'  at around the 5-year mark  i woke up to things such as r collapse  r antiwork  r lostgeneration  it opened my mind as to how much the wool has been meticulously pulled over all our eyes collectively  and now i cannot 'unsee' what is really going on in the world   i do believe we are witnessing the end times and will highly likely see some horrific outcomes in our lifetimes    so  for the last 5 years  i have been in a trance-like state at work not really caring or believing in it anymore  because i find it utterly pointless  at the same time  the system demands that i continue this path because i have no other options but to pay my bills and keep a roof over my family's head  despite several failed attempts at small businesses in order to escape the 'rat race' i find myself in    i guess the main point i want to get across is that i feel there are much bigger fish to fry in the world right now  so much so that i even feel guilty for getting up and taking a shower  using resources such as water  gas and petroleum - in order to look presentable  only to get to my place of work  just to come back home  rinse and repeat the whole damn week    now  say that it was possible just to just 'exist' without 'requiring' a job  for example  if universal basic income became a given thing  you could pay all of your basic bills by doing absolutely nothing if you so chose  i honestly believe most people would then go and find altruistic purposes in their lives    in the current sorry state of the world  i know that i would change my work role immediately to something more community-focused  my dad is retired  but he builds residential automated hydroponic stations that use a water catcher  solar panel and battery to regulate the watering of around ten large growing planters for any kind of vegetable or herb you'd like to grow  i feel that helping to build those for people around our community would make so much more eco-sense  going forwards  i could see this as how we'd play our part in the community  of course  this isn't possible right now because it is not profitable  or at least not profitable enough to pay my monthly bills  so  i stick with my 'pointless' job  because i am very much stuck here  but this is it  my case in point - wasted time and potential in my own life    also  for those that would prefer to just exist and observe the world going by via universal basic income  that is completely fine too  i'm not here to have a cheapshot at anybody  we are all given the gift of life to do as we wish  hopefully in a respectful and good manner  but at the moment we are being utterly exploited and there are so many intelligent people out there that are wasting away their potential in shit fucking roles just because the upper crust want to increase their stock market high scores  at the expense of our only damn planet    i'm so vexed by this concept that i struggle to see past it most mornings  especially in those waking moments    don't get me wrong  i'm not saying we shouldn't work  there are a plethora of important infrastructure jobs that must be done to keep our basic needs met  but these jobs should be paid handsomely  not the pittance that the workers are on currently  also anybody working these core jobs should only be on 15-20 hours per week and this should be classed as a 'full time' role  especially in the modern world where most of our mundane jobs are automated  this would further free up more allocations for jobs during a work week so that more people have the option to do a job if they want the extra money to improve their lives however they deem fit    life should be for living or improving on  not for wasting away at a job that wouldn't even matter if said job didn't exist    i certainly feel that going forwards  the whole world needs to balkanize to some degree  in order to stop the oligarch companies and instead undertake a transformation of work to do most things small scale and local again   on a planet that just cannot take anymore of our collective bullshit  it blows my mind  what are your thoughts ,psi719

2000,"Just turned 40, and still can't find the motivation to work / progress in my career. Terrified for the future. Guess I'm just looking for solidarity / support.",i just turned 40  and i'm unhappy  the only way to have even a modicum of monetary comfort in a capitalist society is to just trade your already limited free time to a company that demands you to give them even more than that  and that's only if you have been  privileged  enough to get that job in the first place  i was lucky to get this position i am in now  but i'm still working paycheck to paycheck  my company doesn't give raises  not even for cost of living  they told me they'll promote me with a slight raise  but they want 50  hours a week from me if so  that's not a raise  i've looked for other jobs  and although there are some out there that match my actual skill level they want even more of my free time  i had an interviewer once tell me   we'll pay you  100k a year  but we expect 80  hours a week  wtf  even though i'm currently not even making half that  i still rejected the position  giving that kind of time away to these people would make me lose whatever tiny bit of happiness i've been holding to after all these years   reading a lot of anarchist  anti-work philosophy these last twenty years or so  and being active in movements  hasn't really helped me  enjoy  the working life either    it's that whole officespace quote   ever since i started working  every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it  so that means that every single day that you see me  that's on the worst day of my life   i feel trapped  but that's pretty much life in late stage capitalism i guess   i have interests outside of work  of course  i write a lot  and am hoping to self-publish  i'm creating a board game as well  losing these passions just to make an extra  20k -  30k a year isn't worth it to me  but that also means i'll be working my whole life  because i can't retire off what i'm making now   i'm just tired of it all  tired that even if my peers aren't  happy  about this type of life  they have come to accept it and are able to just shrug whatever sadness they have about it away  why can't i just shrug it away  i get gut punched each time i try  tired of my family pushing me into a better paying  more hours worked career despite them knowing how bad my mental health would get  tired that capitalism will soon push me into that kind of career anyways just to keep afloat   anyways  i was poor most of my adult life  below  then just above  poverty level  and am white  i'm not there anymore  luckily  but am still living paycheck to paycheck  i can't even begin to imagine the pressures capitalism  and those who enforce it  place on those who have less privilege than i do    fuck ,prh0wt

2022,U.S. Medical system makes working pointless,what is the point of working and saving when our crappy health rationing system will bankrupt you when you get sick and take everything you have worked for  even people with health insurance are going bankrupt because insurance companies always find a loophole so they don't have to pay  just when you are at your sickest and most vulnerable they hit you with a deluge of paperwork and hoops you have to jump through to get them to pay  there is no transparency in the system so even if you have premium insurance the doctor who treats you is somehow out of network and you insurance doesn't cover it    working in america is a bad deal for working class people  you have no security when everything you work for can be taken from you because you fall ill  tying healthcare to employment is oppressive and leads to even more insecurity  the business closes due to no fault of your own and again your life savings are on the line if you get ill because you can't pay your cobra premiums ,prgdjp

2030,"Hate the government instead of the rich for your problems, the wealth gap is a symptom.",  hate on this sub is like 90 10 the rich vs government  it should be flipped  this is going to be an unpopular opinion on this sub  i spent some time reading the comments on the thread about retirement  sad for me to see people who live in fear and are lost  i was broke and thought this way a few years back  i want to help shed light on what i learned last few years becoming libertarian  i am a first generation immigrant  parents less money than myself  30  work for crony private sector  my bosses are retired government employees that receive full state pensions 10k a month working full time  state pays pension as long as they are not working for state government  i've seen enough which is why my politics changed   are most people pretty screwed  not in comparison with other countries but with what usa could be  yes  i absolutely agree  you aren't just trapped financially  also mentally  your wages don't stretch very far  loans  healthcare  retirement  cant afford to start family  etc  the natural thing to do is to find another group to vilify  hence the rich hate  i mean if someone else has a bigger slice of a pie  that means my slice is smaller right  but if you know the fiscal changes the last hundred years  you'd be able to link issues with policies   1  federal reserve eroding your earnings via inflation tax  and  look up the cantillion effect  labor is last group to catch up to higher price  before nixon took the us off the gold standard the dollars could be exchanged for gold  now not backed by anything the money you earn will eventually be worth the paper they are printed on  the federal reserve now acts like an investment insurance to the stock market  bails them out directly  bailout  and indirectly  stimulus  it should not have that type of power or that kind of responsibility  the fed is directly transferring purchasing power from wage earners to stock holders each time they come to  save the day  and some of you cheer them on  because you were emotional that this crisis is different and is world ending  instead the business that mismanaged should be allowed to go out of business instead of getting put on lifeline with cheap loans from the fed   2  government cronies that  serve you  to justify their existence  but are basically money laundering  i work in infrastructure sector not high on the totem pole but enough to be in email chains  and my job is like treading in a mine field when you don't want to say anything about waste or obscurity  you don't know if that expensive thing someone wants to pay for is tied to someone important and your ass is gone  i was in a government department intern class  13 14 people are not civil engineering majors when it's a ce field  they were all someone's kid  myself the only one  and don't get me started on government unions  contractor unions  oh not to mention look up davis bacon if you are looking for work  guys gets paid  60 an hour holding a stop sign knows people  last year we had to dispose a dump truck worth of soil that had a little fuel spilled in it  instead of burning it locally we were told to fly it to another town with an  epa certified site  and they burn it there  20 bucks says that site's owner is related to someone and it only cost the tax payers 100k  trust me i was way liberal before working  now libertarian   3  licensure boards  they are often state backed or sponsored and are designed to keep barrier to entry unnecessarily high to manipulate up wages for the exclusive club  not to mention royalty i mean fees  it is serfdom  2000 hours and hundreds of bucks to legally cut hair  and this jacks up price of services  your earnings worth less when you buy these services   4  hoa  zoning commission  business license commerce regulators  all these blood suckers prevent you from opening many types of home business  they force you to rent from overpriced commercial property if you ever saved enough to start a small business  where i came from people were able to open convenient stores from their own tiny one bedroom street side homes and made better money than wages  and street vendors stands if you didn't have a home to do that  american regulators took out the bottom rungs on an actual capitalist system  just look at covid  somehow walmart is open but mom and pops are forced to close  that's a government hitman job   5  taxes  the original taxes were introduced to tax the rich  now it's really the middle class paying most of the taxes  property taxes just gets passed on to renters  social security tax turns into a slush fund for point no 2  and gives you little in comparison to if you put the same money in an etf retirement account  you complain about rich people not paying enough  but ask yourself how little of that tax even comes back to you  you get the crumbs while the rags to riches politicians get them by the loaf   6  healthcare  another thing fucked by the government  it's insurance tax codes written off as expenses  it's when they limit income cap and employers used expensive insurance policies to attract people  it's when you gave so much power to bureaucrats that they and not us gets to decide what meds can be sold  so now pharmas have political contributions as a business expense  that gets added to our cost  and not to mention the law barring pharmacy from selling me meds that i know i can take  but requires me to check back with the doctor pay them a few hundred bucks so he can write me a permission note again  all this shit adds up   7  education  like point 2  it's another money machine whenever government is involved  overpriced  overpaid  when they know government is giving easy loans we saw the greatest price jacking in history  a greedy private lender knows some degrees are not marketable and they would not have allowed you to owe 200k on something that earns you 20k a year   8  all this adds up  stop thinking about standard of living just in how much you earn  but how to get more with what you earn  basically most things government touches makes you get less with what you earn  they are not your friends  i thought i was a left leaning person in my early 20s  but the more i got older the more i realized that the less entities mentioned above the easier it would be to climb out  as long as you're willing to work   how to climb out  3 years ago i was 27  jobless  no health coverage  no house  savings ran dry  just had a civil engineering degree and that was it  worked in research in a state uni for the year prior and made 10 an hour doing difficult data analytics and material strength testing that is worth  40 hourly private sector  dream of research wasn't as fun as i thought when i started doing it  and it didn't pay for the lifestyle i wanted  and i quit what i wanted for a long time because i came to realize i made a mistake  i got a remote travel required job instead that paid a premium since others don't want to be remote  my net worth went up 300k this past year alone from earnings  real estate and investment appreciation  i think sometimes you gotta not be afraid to move around between employers and cities for opportunities  and not be afraid to ask for raises  they can sense if you think you can't live without this job  don't live in a place where you are not appreciated  move  be flexible  see what services are needed and do that  i've met people doing non college degree jobs making 5x your typical college grad jobs  find ways to save and invest it  think about your future don't think as you go  and always learn new skills  be aware but don't worry sick about the world and anything out of your reach  i got friends from hs who complains about big things all day  no action  same place 12 years later  life is never fair  fuck those that painted the picture that it is  i got no family members not a single one in this country  competing in a super nepotistic industry  kid who sit next to me for promotions has company name as his last name no coincidence  but what could complaining do for me  unless you start a revolution to change things  i will do what i am doing now  the problems i identified are not going to change because you elect some smooth talker  period  in the meantime better yourself no one is looking out for you and accept that fact ,pri3t9

2036,"Labor is such a mess right now, and I'm loving it",just dropping in to share an anecdote   i live in a very high col area  and was dining out at what i'll call an  upper middle class  restaurant last night - the type that you can't call average  but isn't nice enough to be called fine dining  if you will  it's the type of place that would previously have been considered one of the  good  places to work as far as restaurants go and always pulled high-quality candidates as far as staff went   due to covid i haven't been out to eat in the current labor market but was at the tail end of a long drive from a relative's with no food at home and i finally got a taste firsthand of what i've been reading about  what a mess  i was seated outside and could observe the five other outdoor tables  and our waitress got  every single table's  order wrong in some way shape or form  often on multiple occasions  forgot to put in more than half of her orders  brought the wrong thing for several orders  didn't bring plates napkins silverware  etc  etc   the beautiful thing was nobody blamed her  i could overhear the conversations at the three tables nearest me on the subject  and nobody at the other three tables made a scene about it either  among people who largely are well-off enough to never have worked a retail restaurant job post-college who are generally accustomed to a high level of service  there seemed to be universal understanding that the waitress had more tables than was ideal even for an experienced staff member  and had very very clearly never been trained properly for her job  she was probably extremely new and had been thrown onto a saturday night dinner shift with almost no preparation  i also imagine that she never would have been hired by this restaurant under other circumstances  and the fact that they did hire her to do something she was potentially unqualified for wasn't her fault   we were all  in a sense  learning what the value of well-trained and good labor is in those positions by having it taken away  and while people weren't happy with the situation  more so than ever before  the opinion didn't seem to be this was a problem with the specific server  or that  millennials gen z don't have a good work ethic  or that it was fair to demand that she perform as well at her job as her predecessors and magically just be better because she was letting us down and we were the customers and she wasn't allowed to do that  like  they understood that the labor market had let her and countless other people down and that was the problem  perhaps she was never meant to work in a restaurant - she certainly wasn't a natural  but this is what you  should  get if you are paying people poverty wages - people who for personal or training reasons aren't equipped to do the job   on another happy note  in a casual conversation with a former boss of mine  a fully-embraced-my-life as a bland 60 year old suburban white pre-trump mildly conservative upper middle manager type  without him knowing  my  opinions on the matter  he openly began advocating the revolt of the masses to me and was adamant that eventually  the oppressed will rise up and then went on to clarify that he wasn't associating himself as part of that class  but got into the trade-offs that he had to personally make and wished he didn't because there wasn't much alternative besides  haha live in suffering and die destitute then  i guess   i hope this means real change is possible  i'm hedging my bets personally  but among people who have historically been hesitant to change what seemed like it was  working  for them and who have a lot to lose  i'm starting to see opinions shift in a non-trivial way  it's not just  oh well it would be nice if it was possible but  there's a real recognition that it  should  be possible ,prbrxt

2066,Losing my career and gaining self-realization,this is a rant but please feel free to ask me questions or discuss  if you read it all  thanks for sticking with me  i ve played hockey since i was barley able to crawl  and have been coaching since i was 16  i m 24 now and recently had a falling out with the organization i was working with up until this thursday   backstory  i returned to the us from canada after aging out of a jr  a hockey league in ontario 4 years ago  and went through an existential crisis and self introductory period in a lot of ways   after a few years of assistant coaching with a hockey club in my hometown  i rejoined with them after my jr  hockey career ended  i was given a lot of freedom to run summer workouts and build programs for our teams  players  and freely become a student of hockey in my own way  which is what works best for me  i ve explored other ways  but i find doing my own exploring and evolving is the healthiest thing for me   anyways  i was told the way i did things was problematic  likely because politics in the work place don t really exist to me when it s something i really love doing  they left me without a paycheck on my last week  and i m still owed that but it s almost not worth the energy because i don t want to work for money  i ll take it  since that s what apparently has worth today  but i digress    same guys ran it since i was 8 years old  and thought all the players i coached loved my workouts and style of coaching  i guess they didn t like my ideas    so after all the drama dissolved  i felt tonight on a run that feeling of originality and inspiration  i hadn t felt that since i was probably 19 years old  and it had nothing to do with words of reassurance  or money  or stability  or anything that  keeps me afloat  i just long for freedom now more than anything else  and i d rather die with lint in my pocket and freedom in my heart than all the money in the world and no soul to witness the sublime life we all deserve  i m just hoping to discover what it means to me to be alive  and  career building  ain t it ,prly8y

2070,The hospitality industry sucks. I'm done.,haven't posted here before but buckle up  cause this is going to be a rant   i've worked in hotel maintenance for 3 years now and i'm sick of it  2 separate hotels  both big names  my current one is awful  out front they pay to keep it looking nice   flower lady  furniture touch-ups  valet  etc  but behind the scenes it's falling apart  multiple major pieces of equipment are at the end of their life expectancy and need replacing  most of this equipment was poorly designed in the first place   not intended for this climate  too much usage  etc  just  nothing is right here  everything is broken or stupid or poorly thought out  upper management pretends to listen and then spend their money on more pool furniture or stupid events   my department is a shit-show  there's  me  my boss who i really like and followed here from the other hotel  a venezuelan temp guy who works really hard but goes back home in december  and our  senior mechanic  who's a 60-something year old who drinks silver and is trying to build a perpetual motion machine  that's it  for a property this size we should have 10  but we have 3   here's a story  my hotel almost got in trouble for a safety violation  a jackass in another department tried to blame it on us  despite the fact that this had been a problem before we got here and management was already aware of it  they just hadn't done anything to fix it  my boss countered and took the jackass to hr  their response  they promoted the jackass and made him my boss' boss  what   these guys are management  they're supposed to plan for things  figure things out  resolve conflicts  have back up plans  these people couldn't plan a trip to the store  it's always last minute emergencies because they didn't bother to check anything or think about anything    here's one  they wanted to swap out some coffee makers  the old coffee makers were rented so i can't touch them  sounds easy enough  call the tech for the old ones and have him remove them  call the tech for the new ones and have him install them  if you're feeling really smart you can call both of them and schedule them to come out  simple right  apparently not  they didn't call anybody to remove them and instead wanted us to do it   also can you do it right now  thanks  bye  we had other stuff planned but fine  we take the coffee makers down  a few days later a tech comes to install the new coffee makers  only he's alone and isn't allowed to lift them by himself  he also isn't allowed to lift them with one of us  it can only be 2 of us or 2 techs  no mix and match for liability reasons  we didn't know we were doing this until they called us out of the blue  so now they've pulled two guys off of what they were supposed to be doing for some coffee makers that we shouldn't even be touching in the first place  but fine  whatever  we'll lift these things up onto the counter and then we can go  the tech will take care of the rest  only they don't fucking fit  they're too tall and hit the shelf above the counter  they eventually had us cut a notch in the shelf for the coffee makers  the manager who should have been directing this was actually the same jackass from above  he was busy schmoozing some guy out on the golf course and didn't answer his phone  just a clusterfuck from start to finish  best part is those old coffee makers are still sitting in the hallway cause they can't figure out what to do with them   how can they make the wrong decision all the time  even flipping a coin should give them a 50  success rate    and for the grand finale  the straw that broke the camel's back  since our department is so short staffed we are quite low on specialized labor  kitchen tech  refrigeration tech  electrician  you get the idea  so we have to call outside companies in  no big deal  pretty common  but lately those companies havent been answering our calls  couldn't figure out why until my boss mentioned that accounting hasn't been paying them  we've confronted them and gotten nothing  this has been going on for months  how can they not pay people  a tech comes in  they give my boss an invoice  my boss signs the invoice to say  yes this tech did this work  i agree to pay him x dollars  and then accounting pays them  that's it  this isn't complicated  so now the techs won't answer our calls and won't come out because they don't think they'll get paid  meaning the work doesn't get done and people are left complaining at me   i'm done  i worked straight through covid because hotels were essential somehow  i worked for a month straight with no days off because we were so understaffed  usually 60 hours a week with no recognition  and they still expect us to jump and instantly solve their problems  i did not spend 5 years in college  get a bachelor's of science just to plunge toilets and get yelled at by colleagues all so some fatass upper management who doesn't know the meaning of a full days work can make some bonus that's more than i make in a year  fuck it  fix your own shit  i'm out ,prb0b9

2074,Anyone else feel unemployable?,i did various courses in things i was good at  but never good enough  so i didn't get the all valuable  experience  that employers are fetishize  the emptiness of that word - experience  i graduated with a phd but it looks like despite really fucking trying  all academics have closed ranks and it's pretty obvious  they don't want me in their field either  so i'm kinda  getting old  apparently  though i fail to see the logic of that with potentially 20  years of working left  which is a long time - 2001 seems like aeons ago  i want to escape ireland which i really don't fit into and go on a european adventure  work is a necessary evil for that  i just don't want to get esl jobs  retail etc  because they pay peanuts and there's no job security plus i've worked in esl for 5 years and my brain is turning to mush with the boredom    it's kind of fucked beyond recognition tbh  the bullshit of academia can't be overstated  they constantly shift the goalposts  nepotism is redefined as  moulding  when it's just supervisors with influence picking their favourite students and plonking them in tenure track careers  originally you could take a few years to get into academia  now there's a 5 year window  courtesy of neoliberal infiltration and hr assholes  after that  too late  you're out  this excludes people with experience outside academia who can enrich academic environments  again what you're left with is a closeted  stagnant environment which preselects for people who conform most to the characteristics of self-importance  ego and snootiness associated with the quintessential academic  seriously  i'm no comedian but so many academics i've met have been  stiff  and up their own asses    i'm aware though that the bs extends to everything  for example i'm horrified and baffled by the ageism bigotry i read about in i t  apparently being over 30 is  old  too old to make a career change  or teaching where it's just psychological abuse until burnouts and breakdowns  it's like there is 1 3 of the population who make work hell for everyone else but they're too vacant to realise it themselves  the employment landscape since 2008 has been bad  but now it's going into full overdrive absurdity and i'm thinking something has to give  it's like a pressure cooker heated to max  the corporations squeal and whine about not finding employees but have requirements so bloody high  only the top 0 01  get an interview  i could be teaching at a university  i've done it before but because i'm not a  superstar  academic they've shut down that future  i could video edit just as well as anyone else but because my experience isn't in a  professional  environment  it doesn't count  i could take a job like graphic design and learn on the job  but no  you must have a portfolio specifically for graphic design  other art doesn't count  and we will not offer training  there are companies like linkedin who hire data entry people but don't pay them  that's the recruitment agency's job  so not only are companies refusing training  they now expect someone else to pay for their hires    it's like fuck these people  they perpetuate this violence of unemployment because that's what it is  it condemns others to poverty  psychological and economic misery  it's like a game of musical chairs where there's one chair and 10000 players ,prhz0t

2086,The funny thing about this sub is... (Serious),the funny thing about this sub is  from what i've been reading  most people here just don't want their life controlled  i thought i was  anti-work  in a sense that i just hated being under someone else's agenda and time   1  they tell me when to show up 2  they tell me what to wear and how to wear it 3  they determine by their own discretion whether my health is severe enough to miss a day or two  4  they operate under 'their' convenience  not the convenience of the people who make them the money   im pretty sure i could make a longer list but these are just main things  i thought i was just a lazy pos but it turns out thats not the case at all and for many people here   when the people here say   it's either slave away or starvation  its true  because it's stating that most businesses are of the same cloth  there are hardly any businesses around that take into account the employees convenience in which they can get the best performance out of them   i recently found out that i enjoy investing  alot  there is risk  but it is far more suitable for me than a back-breaking grind in the name of  work-ethic   i don't care if the people who hate this sub just see everyone as lazy  they believe everyone should just put up with a situation that makes them miserable  and that's working a majority of your life doing something you don't want because you won't have money otherwise   to that i say  there is more to life than unconditional ambition  if someone wants to chill in the grass and eat fruit all day  i say let them   obligating  work only sparks resentment and resistance   we need a way to get  chores  accomplished in a manner that isn't at the expense of one's freedom of choice   many people here aren't lazy  i thought i was lazy but im not  would a lazy person take time to read books to learn about the stock market  i definitely think not  i did what i did on my own time because i was interested in it  this showed me that not wanting to spend 8-12 hours doing work everyday does not make someone lazy   i made  100 dollars in 1 hour the other day and i couldn't have been happier  i had complete control over how i obtained my money  i could've stopped anytime i wanted once i was satisfied with my gain  and i think thats what alot of people want   we need to redefine  lazy  being lazy doesn't mean doing nothing  it means doing the bare minimum  and if that's the case  doing the bare minimum is something even a person who doesn't want to do shit could do  someone isn't gonna complain for working 10 hours a week and make sufficent money to live off of   from investing  100 dollars everyday is  500  2 weeks would be  1000  that's a basic paycheck for alot of people  and i'd have potentially made that in 1 hours time  1 hour each day   instead of  forcing  long hourly wages  we should provide the absolute bare minimum or amount of hours at the employees discretion as a foundation   and then provide incentives and rewards for the longer the employee chooses to stay   i e  if the employee decides to work an 8 hour traditional shift  they get free healthcare on behalf of the company on top of better pay  meaning more frivolous spending money  as opposed to making just enough money to sustain yourself  incentives like this   if an employee decides to work 5 hour shifts  they get much better pay than if they worked a measily 1-2 hours   corporations need to value  time  again and people need to realize how valuable their time really is ,prfbcc

2100,Make way more than other workers. Not sure what to do!,last week i found out i and one other staff make almost  5 more an hour than everyone else  to make things worse  we both are the newest people here    i m extremely grateful that i m paid well  but there are many conflicts with this   i feel like anyone finding out i make so much more would just set a target on my back   yes i can tell them about it and try to get them a raise  this just put me in a weird position  if they didn t get a raise they will still probably be bitter toward me and the manager will have knife out for me  even if they get a raise  the manager definitely will start to look to get rid of me  or worse  loader my pay  so yes  a lost - lost situation here   if i don t rock the boat and keep it to myself  i can imagine they would shaft me hard whenever it come to raise  i m doing very decent on money now  but i need about  4 more a hour to be absolutely comfortable and have money to put toward saving retirement    so i can t afford to just not get a raise or get a shitty  15 cent raise  i m full on determined to get at least  2 raise next year   this put me in weird position when it come to negotiations for a raise  i know they will try very hard to find a way to not give me raise   so i m thinking maybe  when the time come  if they won t give me the raise i want  i can just tell them  look  i know i make way more than everyone else  give me the raise i want or  i let the words out that i m making a lot more than them then you will have a real mess on your hands  give me the raise i want or they learn how much more i m making   but that doesn t seem like a good idea   so  any suggestions on what i should do ,prcou3

2102,I feel like the butt end of a joke,i work under the table  which i always felt was a blessing  screw you  taxes  i am a certified nurses aide  privately   for a 96 year old lady with dementia  a rich 96 year old  at that   i also work 20  hour shifts  which isnt super easy because i have to stay awake during the entire time   but leaves me more time to be at home with my child  being a nurses aide is a lot harder than people think   lots and lots of physical and verbal abuse from the very people person youre working to keep alive and well  but physically its hard too  and the pay is terrible  when i was working at a nursing home often taking care of 20-40people a night  i made less than an average fast food worker  and i went to school for this job  working under the table felt like a blessing because the difference in my paycheck without taxes taken out  made it feel much more  glamorous     on to the point of my story     the children  whom are in their 50s 60s  active and well  are in charge of the finances  so they pay us biweekly  one of them was visiting last week  and while i always find it weird that we're still required to come take care of their mother when they are here to visit   when they are more than capable of doing so  you cant walk your mom to the bathroom while youre here  and have me do tasks that feel a little  degrading  theres just something about being ordered around when they just sit there  for example they were eating  a meal i prepared  and the daughter will ask her mom if she wants salt for her food  and when the mom says yes  the daughter turns to me and says  can you get her salt  like uh  sure  but also when she was visiting  i had to clear her plates and cups   had to wash them  etc  okay fine but can you at least rinse the dirty food off your dish so i dont have to wipe off the bits and pieces that fell from your mouth  on the last day  she had a plane to catch at 6am  so she came knocking on her moms door  at 445am daughter stayed in a hotel  paid for by mom  turned all the lights on  cooked herself breakfast and packed herself lunch for the trip  and left the kitchen a mess of half eaten food  crumbs  3 cups  a plate  bowl  pan  wet used tea bags  dirty used disposable mask  dirty napkins all on the counter  for me to clean    guess who forgot to pay us  4 days ago  ah yes  the person i just waited on hand and food when  as a trained medical professional   i am not even hired to take care of in that way  i am not a maid  and i am not hired to take care of family members etc     i always dread when her awful  pretentious   disgusting offspring come to visit  because it means im taking care of 2  people for the price of one  but it just feels like a huge slap in the face when you can do that  and not even be concerned enough to mail a check to pay for the people who are with your dying  not nice mother  24 hours a day  so pretentious that you assume we are here to wait on you and your family   but even worse when our livelihood depends on you remembering to compensate us for our work     i am currently on a 20 hr shift with a migraine going on 11 hours  but still being a kind person to the lady i am responsible for  but i was very excited to get my little paycheck so that when it actually deposits in 2 more days  i could pay my bills  but as of right now  me and the other 3 cnas have no idea when we will see our earnings     i wish i could quit and do something from home  so it didnt feel like someone else held my life in their hands  this life is a joke     sorry for the long rant ,prido9

2110,Speculations about the future: how Capitalism could keep humanity enslaved,hi  i've been suggested this subreddit by chance and i promptly joined  before talking about the subject i'd like to tell you something about myself    i'm 42  i come from a family of workers  my grandparents were farmers  i've got a 13 years old son and i'm divorced   i've been working in it for a big insurance company for several years now  i'm a project manager of sort  i like my job  nonetheless i can't help but feel a slave of a system i don't like   smartworking made me think a lot about our  modern life  and the absurdity of commuting every day just to sit in front of a monitor   i'm italian so english is not my native language  forgive me if something sounds funny   having said that  i'd like to go back to the topic at hand   we all have heard about the rising of automation and i'm sure most of you have thought about what the world could be once robots will be able to substitute humans in their job   i personally think the real  humanism  can only be reached by total automation  when nobody is forced to have a job to sustain him herself   a society forged on people who are free to do what they want will inevitably make social differences disappear and this is where the troubles could start emerging   capitalism is built upon social classes  it splits society in blocks based on their income  a very minuscule group of people  the ones in the upper echelon  controls everything  they can influence the market  they can decide prices  they can make masses of people poor at their whim   these people won't surrender their power so easily  they don't want humanity to stand on the same level  they need control and they don't consider themselves equal to the rest of society   to start the real automation process you need money  you need economic and political power  you need the means to develop and build the robots   factory owners will consider these robots their property  even when the robots will be able to build themselves  even when they won't have to move a finger to make the factory work   even now i read articles about how we should start thinking about a universal basic income to keep the system going   this is the worst thing that could happen to humanity  it would stop the process of liberating humanity from the yoke of currency   capitalism is organizing itself right now  it's creating the foundations to keep us under its control even when the automation will do all the work   i strongly believe people should reject the idea of being dependant from currency  we need to lose the concept of exchanging  money  for goods  robots will give us all we need and these robots must be owned by humanity  not by capitalists   i know all these topics are far away in the future  but i'm afraid the few people who control the world are already moving to keep us in the corner   i'd like to hear what you think about it  am i too pessimistic   thanks for your time ,pr4jut

2164,The Stupid Job: A Memoir,jobs are confusing to say the least  my previous job was a material handler at fedex  and i absolutely hated it  the pay was around  15 25 an hour and i worked part time  which meant roughly around 5 hours a day   5 days a week  now i know that sounds like heaven considering the fact that i don't have many  debts  to pay for  but if i'm going to be honest it was one of the worst jobs i've ever had  at first it seemed like a pretty cool job  mostly a male environment  and some crude humour   which in no way am i dissing on  and i got along with many  if not most of my co-workers  yet  there was one thing we could agree on  and that was how terrible this place was ran  there were many minor incidents that had happened  but the lack of responses from the managers were beyond  there was one instance where a small chemical spill happened in the belly of the truck  i ran to the bathroom to wash my hands as it was burning the hell out of my skin  that didn't seem to work so i proceeded one of my managers on duty for help  he looked at my hands for a solid minute   as my hands are still burning  and told me to wash my hands  i then went to the bathroom as i was told and washed my hands a second time  i ran back as it was still burning my hands and he proceeded to tell me to wash them a third  i finally got some burn cream from a co-worker and that seemed to resolve it much better  i was a little upset by them but not too fazed  nothing happened for a couple of months until one day i was working in a truck and a 40 pound pole had fallen onto the back of my head  if i'm going to be completely honest its like i couldn't feel it because all i felt was numb  i looked into the light and it was pretty blurry so i stood up and walked around for a second  i asked for an icepack and didn't receive one for 30 minutes and i was dumbfounded  i knew by then the company was sh t   another instance was bathroom usage  i went to the bathroom once and i was asked later that day if i had menstruation issues by my male manager because he felt as if i took a long time in the bathroom  i also always saw my managers on snap or tinder  and i mean i would be too if i could but they specified no phones inside the building due to  privacy issues  it was one of the worst jobs and honestly i called out so much  i thought i was lazy and unmotivated because  i didn't want to go to a job that was only five hours a day  moving on i have now found a different job  in which i work a ten hour night shift and i love it  i guess it goes to show that some jobs are just not for you   also  look the job up on indeed before you apply  people will give you feedback on your future hellhole ,pr4pe0

2174,"The planet’s dying, people are starving, and I have to cook pounds of food just to throw it away so I can pay rent",i m a closer at a grocery store deli  aside from the  fresh  salads  aka pre-made  pre-packaged garbage we just dump in a tray to put under display  and the hand-sliced cold cuts and cheese  you can also come to the deli for our hot food case and a self-serve hot soup case  and  my god  the amount of waste this  one  department makes in a single day is harrowing  especially if you re on closing shift since that s when we have to throw away the most amount of food   first  there s the self-serve soup case  already a terrible idea during a pandemic  they closed the self-serve case for a couple months before reopening it because corporate is stupid  and every night that s no less than seven pounds of cooked soup to throw away   then there s our main hot case  the one where we have a huge assortment of all types of cooked foods  chicken tenders  chicken wings  baked chicken  fried chicken  potato fries  mac and cheese  etc    technically we re supposed to throw out anything that gets put in the hot case and replace it every four hours  we usually don t  though  because fuck hustle and grind culture  and i at least try to cook as little as possible because i know most of it is going to be wasted  still  we need to make sure there s at least enough cooked food out and that none of it is too old or dried out  because otherwise customers are going to complain  or one of the higher-ups at the store will complain   i shit you not  one time the store director had us cook  way  too much fried chicken because the store was doing a big sale event  the store director wanted to get a picture of a huge pile of fried chicken so he could send it to the big corporate overlords  well guess what  even though it was a big sale day  8-piece fried chicken for only  5  we were  still  left with like  forty  pieces of fried chicken to throw away by day s end  but hey  at least the ceo got to jerk off to a pic of a fried chicken tower   and i hate how entitled customers are  these people either don t know or don t care about the ramifications of this fucked up   keep fresh  hot food on display all day  system  people complaining when we don t have enough ready-to-eat hot food because they need their god damn chimkin tendies right now dammit  one time our hot case broke down  we literally could not have any hot food on display for almost a week  and while most customers were understanding  we had one fucking karen come in and throw a fucking tantrum because we couldn t have any fried chicken out  and  i only came here for the fried chicken  bitch was acting like we broke our hot case on purpose just to spite her specifically  i  despise  that  gimme gimme right now  bullshit  you re in a fucking grocery store in a shopping center  either find something else to eat  or if you need fried chicken  that  fucking badly  there s a fucking kfc and a popeyes just around the god damn corner   all of this just forces me into a negative feedback loop  if i don t cook a disgusting amount of food for the hot case someone might complain about it  but if i  do  cook a lot of food it s guaranteed that all of a sudden we ll have a drop in customers  and then all the extra shit i cooked won t sell and has to be thrown away   and of course  being a big chain grocery store  we can t give food to anyone for free  so all the food that needs to be tossed goes in the dumpster with a padlock and a compactor inside it  i would love to find a way to sneak out with all the cooked food that s still safe to eat and give it to  anyone  who needs it  but of course i can t because if i get caught  and i will coz grocery stores have security cameras everywhere  i ll get fired and then i won t be able to pay rent    oh and  naturally  our prices keep going up  since the planet is dying and all  and i hate that i have to bite my tongue every time a customer asks me why our chicken tenders cost more now  or worse  complains about it  like  i m just a clerk  i m not in charge of shit  the only response i can give is   we re in the middle of a global pandemic as well as total ecological and economic collapse   of course  everything s getting more expensive and will only keep  getting  more expensive  but obviously i m not going to say that to customers so i just have to smile and say   i m sorry  i don t know why prices are going up it s up to our vendors   i m writing this because i m almost finished with my shift and i had to throw out maybe thirty pounds of cooked chicken alone  and that s par for the course here  and that s  just  the cooked chicken  there s plenty of other perfectly edible food that gets wasted on a daily basis at this department  which is still only a  fraction  of the total daily waste produced by the  entire store  it s fucking unreal  who the fuck came up with this model for grocery store delis  there are a lot of things i hate about my job  but the sheer amount of waste produced by our hot case alone is just  so depressing    this system is fucked and i hate participating in it  but i

2203,Are we just hostages?,i ve been considering why it seems so difficult for governments to extract the wealth out of these huge billion dollar corporations  the most obvious answers is that these companies leverage their huge wealth to essentially bribe and lobby their way out of paying their full dues  i do believe this is definitely one aspect however i believe there is a more sinister angle  the true power at play for these companies is not their massive wealth but comes from the jobs they  provide  even a well meaning politician or government is going to be reticent at taking action against these corporations when it risks jobs of the people they represent and these jobs are necessary for providing the basic needs of these people   to that end these  jobs  are utilised for political capital to keep governments from acting against them  it is then obvious to see why these companies would have an interest in inflating how many jobs they provide giving rise to so many unnecessary jobs and wasted labour  this goes against what would be expected of a company which would be to minimise costs but when this labour can be used to gain real power it makes sense  if instead these corporations paid their dues and the government were to provide for the people in terms of benefits or ubi or whatever then that power would be given to the government  these corporations want to be the ones to provide sustenance in the form of unnecessary salaried employment because then they hold the keys  they are the hand that feeds and hence that is where the power lies    ultimately it just feels as if these corporations are essentially using their employees as hostages to amass not only wealth but real political power  governments can t act against these companies without risking jobs  these companies can so easily claim that any government action which goes against their interest will cost people jobs since they are fully aware of the inefficiencies within them and can easily drop these unnecessary employees without actually compromising the operations of the business and at the same time make the governments which acted against them extremely unpopular by increasing unemployment and claiming that it was a consequence of action taken by an unfriendly government   the only real way to prevent this kind of thing from getting worse is if jobs and employment are not strictly necessary for basic human sustenance thus diminishing the political power gained through inflating the number of jobs provided by these companies ,pqrypk

2218,"Someone who just resigned post this letter to the whole company, Crazy!!!",   care coordinator resigns from health home     to whom it may concern    accept this as my formal resignation  due to the lack of leadership  toxic work environment  constant harassment  bullying  and threats from the management team i have to unfortunately resign  i have tried on various occasions to express the intensity of my caseload  98 plus members  and the constant bullying of my managers  to my director and human resources and nothing has come of it  things continue on the same path and i do not see any changes happening now or in the future    the extremely high turnover rate of employees has consistently put more pressure on everyone  we consistently have to take on an extra 10 to 20 cases a month due to the aforementioned issues  you are not able to provide the proper care coordination that is required if you can only spend 10 to 15 minutes on the phone with a member  this has caused me a great deal of stress and pain to the point of having to seek medical attention  i have developed anxiety  depression  and panic attacks from the hostile work environment created by middle management  this company is not worth my wellbeing and peace of mind   constantly having our time cards altered and not paid the correct hours worked only adds to the problems  being threatened to go home early on a friday and to return on a saturday to complete work is demoralizing  furthermore  hearing all the floor managers and my director talk about my fellow coworkers while in a managers office is simply unprofessional  but this is just the norm here  it is an everyday occurrence  for your awareness  if you think you are whispering in your so-called  offices  much larger cubicle  and that employees cannot hear  you are mistaken    you have an amazing group of care coordinators  perhaps if you were more understanding and employee oriented you would have enhanced productivity and loyalty  you say you are a progessive company yet you seem to be stuck in a 60's corporate work culture and continuously regress  you also say you are proud to be a black and brown owned business but yet you continue to exploit your staff which is predominantly black  brown  and female  you employ multiple single mothers and you are inflexible to their familial needs by forcing last minute weekend work  you employ mass punishment among the staff instead of addressing concerns individually  management routinely threatens coordinators' employment by using insubordination as a scare tactic  to keep people in line    i will not say i am sorry for being human and caring for the wellbeing of my members  while there have been instances of not having my contacts completed by the deadline  it is an unrealistic expectation for gbuahn to require coordinators complete 100 contacts by the 15th of the month  considering that we must tend to numerous members who are experiencing multiple crises  meeting this deadline wouldn't be an issue if the caseload were manageable  at this point you are just using the members for profit  furthermore  while i have not participated  i found it unethical  and fraudulent to complete mental health questionnaires  phq 2  amp  phq 9  and medical history's without the members consent or knowledge having us bill for chronic conditions because those are billed at a higher rate is also deceitful  moreover  conducting dse efforts in order to bill for a member that has been contacted but no services rendered just to charge medicaid is a dishonest business practice due to the high workload and poor processes  care coordinators have been put in compromising situations where they unknowingly billed for deceased members you routinely enroll prospective members that do not meet state eligibility criteria and when identified by coordinators you hinder their disenrollment by claiming   the possibility of other chronic conditions you employ vazquez-gardner family and friends into decision making positions which lead to questionable business practices and policies it is frustrating when patients routinely express concern with being misdiagnosed and being prescribed opiates excessively at urban family practice  upon notification to my leadership nothing has been remedied    when it comes to taking care of employees your solution is to let them wear jeans on fridays but then force them to provide two canned goods or requiring them to pay  5 00 for their participation is incomprehensible  i hope you realize a boat ride  free pizza  a  100 bonus  or a  christmas gala  does not fix the toxic work environment  people cannot be bought  in case you are not aware  the current social sentiment of the country is that people want to be treated with dignity and respect  hopefully you realize this sooner than later    i hope you address some of these issues at your upcoming town hall meeting    dora almazan   former care coordinator ,pr1h5m

Have I made a mistake?,i'm a 26 year-old woman in nc  and i was diagnosed with adhd and persistent depressive disorder around may of last year  at the same time  i was working at a bake shop and taking classes at my university  it got so bad that i had to take a medical withdrawal from college so i could focus on just one thing  attempting to earn a living  i worked for a little over a year before quitting abruptly  my decision was preceded by a toxic social hierarchy in a team based setting where my manager would protect her team leads that contributed to a decaying work environment  a few examples include  having a coffee bar with only one person on station  getting backed up with orders  visibly frustrated customers  and no one coming to help -- instead they would go to the back to chat and play on their phones  another being that i would be treated like the social outcast  never included in any conversation despite my efforts  and practically ignored by my coworkers unless i put them on the spot by asking for help which only made tensions worse  these are people that revel in the misery they cause  and thrive in maintaining superiority over others  i quickly became their target and was kept outside of their social group from the very beginning   these are just two examples among a generally immature  petty  and horribly toxic environment that made getting up in the morning near impossible  often i would get ready while sobbing and screaming into the universe for some escape  it got so bad that i would have alcohol in my car that i would drink during my break to take the edge off  which bled into my days off  i was drinking so much i became unrecognizable  then the suicidal thoughts appeared stronger and stronger  to the point that i was actively planning out giving away all of my possessions  re-homing my cat  and researching suicide methods   so in late august i quit over text and just about burned every bridge  i know that's not the healthiest exit but i can't begin to describe the elation i felt knowing i no longer had to wake up to another nightmare for minimum wage while being mistreated by rude and entitled customers   i'm still applying around for another job  and while i get interviews occasionally nothing has come to fruition  i really just want to focus on finishing my degree but i know i can't survive on the little aid i receive  and i doubt i can qualify for unemployment based on the circumstance above  i'm wondering if there's anything at all that i can do  at the rate i'm going i will be staring down the barrel of homelessness  or worse yet again ,pqsrvg

2272,I'm tired of my job,after scrolling this sub for a while  i wanted to share my experience and thoughts  tl dr at the end    i'm a biomedical engineer  and i work at a hospital  i work 6 days a week from 7am to 4pm  but still i'm on call 24 7  luckily in the time that i have been working here i've been called a few times  but still  sometimes i get messages or calls from the staff to my personal phone  because we don't have a work phone  nevertheless the time off work doesn't feel like enough to feel rested  regarding vacations  i hate that i basically don't have vacations  the first year you don't have vacations  and after completing one year  they only give you 6 days for al the year  and they increment really slowly  8 days for two years  and so on  until it reaches certain cap  sadly this is dictated by the country's law  and i don't have holidays  because it's a technical operator  position  but my boss does  because his position is administrative  also he only works 5 days  and in this case they pay double  but i sometimes want the day off  no come here and drain my energy   activity wise  mainly i answer calls from the different areas and i go  and solve their equipment related problems  but the problem is  they're usually the most trivial problems  i e  the device wasn't turned on  it wasn't connected to the electricity  it has a different configuration  etc  and eventhough i had explained several times  and teach them how to solve this kind of issues  they don't even try to look if the machine is connected  if it doesn't turns on i am immediately called  there are some nurses that go beyond and try to solve this kind of issues  but they are few    i hate that in my department there are only two persons  my boss and i  and only one radio  which i only carry  so there are times that everyone needs something  and i get really stressed  because its basically only me  also  when i started working here  during my lunch break i took the radio with  and oh boy how horrible it is  because usually they need something from me when i'm eating  so i needed to talk to my boss to see if he could have the radio while i'm eating  the thing tha annoys me is that i needed to ask him to do it  because eventhough he saw me struggling with it  he never offered himself to do that    also there are some internal stuff that i don't like  but i leave that for another post   salary wise is not that bad  comparing it to other hospitals in the area  i think it's the highest paying i' know  the problem is that it is still not enough  because after all my expenses  housing  gas  food  and random stuff that need to be paid  car problems  paperwork  etc  it's barely enough    so everyday it is difficult for me to get out of bed and come here  to only drain my energy  because eventhough i sometimes have easy days  in which i pass the time by scrolling social media  reddit  watching videos  doing homework  eventhough they have a camera pointing at me  the fact of being here tires me and leaves me sleepy and unmotivated the rest of the day   you may be wondering  why i don't change jobs  or something similar  and i can tell you that it is because of the job opportunities  being a biomedical engineer where i live  only has three options  hospital  sales  and field service  sales and field service are two things that i like less than working at a hospital  because they pay less  and they're basically 24 7 jobs  i have been working in hospitals since before i finished my degree  and since then i knew that i didn't want to be in a hospital  but i have been stuck ever since  i worked as an intern 2 times  one without pay  then after graduating as an engineer  and i basically got fired  and now my positiion is as a technician   i'm currenlty looking to leave healthcare  and have applied to several engineering jobs  but still nothing  i'm also studying a masters in mechatronics to have better opportunities in applying to other positions that  i hope  offers better benefits as well as growth  because in here i can only aspire to become the department's boss  and that's all   thanks for reading i just wanted to rant let it out   tl dr i hate that there are so many little rest days and vacations  i hate what i do  i hate the job opportunities in my area  i don't like that i get paid barely enough to pay my expenses  and i want to get out this area   sorry for the long post  and sorry if it can have some incomplete ideas  i tried my best to express all teh mixture of what i'm thinking and feeling  and i have a lot more that i didn't know how to include  and sorry if i have some grammar mistakes  english is not my native language ,pq7ym3

2284,From my local paper - Hawkers Asian Street Food’s staffing woes were a mess. Raising wages fixed it., will become  10 per hour on sept  30   the pay increases come as 75  of restaurant operators said recruiting employees was their top challenge as of june  according to the national restaurant association   restaurants remain nearly 1 million workers below pre-pandemic employment levels despite job growth in the first half of the year  the business association said in a news release in august    restaurant operators  along with their partners throughout the supply and distribution chain  remain focused on providing diners with a safe and enjoyable experience  amid rising food and labor costs and challenges related to the pandemic  national restaurant association ceo tom bene  said in the release   given these factors  our outlook through the end of the year is one of cautious optimism      a breath of fresh air   in addition to the raises  hawkers also has improved benefits  such as a 401 k  retirement program for employees who average 20 hours per week and have been with the company for six months   hawkers also is working to focus on restaurant employee development  and holding feedback sessions to consider other changes to improve the workplace  spokeswoman esther mcilvain said    it was definitely a breath of fresh air coming here  said 26-year-old server zack tomkin  who started at hawkers last year after working in restaurants since age 18   harrell believes the improvement in his company s staffing happened largely through the increased wages and competitive benefits    outside of covid  this is the most important conversation we ve had as a company in the last 10 years  harrell said   he said while the costs from higher compensation haven t been completely balanced out yet by the savings from not having to replace workers  it is moving in that direction   lower turnover means the business can drop training expenses and productivity  skyrockets  harrell said  he also pointed out the time a manager is taken away from serving guests by having to interview and onboard new employees   the restaurant chain has had minor price increases  but those were based on inflation for foodstuffs and other costs  harrell said   for tomkin  whose wage before tips has increased to  8 an hour from about  6  the extra money helps him afford his own place after his roommate moved out  the raise is especially helpful on slower days    to me  it shows that they care about their employees  which obviously as an employee i love  tomkin said   it s helpful to us in just everyday life  and plus things are getting more expensive  just in general  so of course it helps   tomkin then joked   keep it coming ,pqmwo8

2290,I quit my job a couple of days ago and I don't know how to feel,tdlr  i quit my job to get away from my abusive and manipulating boss and i don't know how to feel about it   i keep crying over and over about it  i'm not in financial ruin because of this thankfully  but it was income that i badly needed since i am a student and trying to get away from an already bad household   i worked for a company as a marketing assistant and i was there for about a year  remote  in hindsight  i should've seen the signs before i even applied  my boss was extremely controlling and only had employees that were either foreign or stoners  not shaming either one  they're all very talented and do not deserve to be there under her  many previous employees quit and people more experienced than my boss turned down the job  i have 4 years of experience in pretty much all things associated with marketing and graphic design   long story short  i went through a grueling year of a lot of work one week and then only 30 mins of billable work for 2 weeks and then so on  she controlled what was billable and what wasn't  her business model was making you do the job the way you think it should be done  she tells you youre wrong  then off the clock you have to fix it  i was berated if i asked a question and was guilt tripped by her saying that it comes out of her pay check if she has to answer me because she wouldn't do it on the clock  i was guilt tripped over and over by her saying that x employee has something going on and they are doing better work than i am  she would say that if i have to fix something or ask a question or if i have to do something for the company and i wanted to be paid for it  it would come out of someone else's pay check   every week she would call and say how bad i am at my job  she said it was a progress and performance check  every time it was just saying how bad i am even though i did work that clients loved  including a 38 slide presentation where she berated me for not adding something that no one mentioned  she got on me for my emails and the order they were in and if they were in a thread or not  she berated me if somethung was wrong  such as with printing or shipping  and i didn't know who was associated with the project or how to contact them  she yelled at me for informing her that something was wrong and  while she doesn't have the contact info for the person associated  that i have to contact them and find the contact info without asking her  i made guidelines and checklists in my off time for every single piece of work i could do and email templates for each one  when she wanted me to send them to her  she yelled at me for doing it on paper even though they were only for me  she would tell me something and make me guess the answer  ie  where do you think this money comes from  how do you think i will pay you  why do you think i called you  etc  all the time and she would make me do tasks on days off and not pay me for it because  it would come out of someone else's paycheck   the nail in the coffin was the call when i quit  she kept talking over me and she talked for about 45 mins until i could speak  i told her i was overwhelmed  not by the work but because i can't ask questions and have to guess what she's thinking  she said i was overwhelmed because i had too much work  she said that the problem is not her it's me  she accused me of having a drug problem when she knows nothing about my life other than work  she said i was just rebelling by telling her my reasoning for doing things the way i do in emails and i'm just angry at her and being a child even though it's because i felt like i had to defend myself when i talked to her  she said i was doing things wrong deliberately ro spite her  she told me about the situations of other employees and how they're doing better than me  i told her a small part of the situations i'm going through right now  i talked about how i asked what platform she wanted me to do invoices on and how she pays people in an email  which is how we communicate  and how because she refused to answer  i revealed sensitive bank information that she didn't even need  she said i wasnt allowed to ask questions and she doesn't have time to answer them and that in my agreement it says i'm not allowed to ask  i looked and nowhere did it say that  she said that i am easily replaceable   i told her  i don't appreciate when you guilt trip me using other people's situations  i also have things going on to a similar caliber  i also don't like that you put words in my mouth  she yelled at me for it  she said that she knows how people like me act and i'm just lying  she said it was disrespectful of me to accuse her of guilt tripping and if i continue to rebel and have a drug problem then i shouldn't be in her team  i told her then i quit    as soon as i got off the call  she deleted my work email and thus all the accounts associated with it  she emailed me an excel sheet to my personal email and requested my final invoice  i can't even check if she's being truthful with her numbers  she emailed me again basically trying to have the final word  saying that it's my fault and i should have done better  saying that i should've anticipated her way of doing business   i cried hard when i got off the phone  i don't have a job anymore while i'm trying to get away  i don't sleep  i'm eating less  i hurt all over  i don't have anything to do  i'm applying for jobs like crazy   i'm happy that i'm not there  but i'm sad that i don't have work  i wish she didn't use me as a punching bag because it's really taking a toll  there's a lot more that she did  but i'm really trying to forget it  i hope karma gets her ass ,pq6vbl

2305,Could use some other opinions,i just recently started my first job about 2 weeks ago  i actually love the job and the co workers that i have during my shifts and the time is great  the pay could be better of course but since its my first job any money is better then no money at all  the job i do is finishing donuts  during any shift its a baker  finisher  and cook its also a breakfast place      if i don't do my job then we lose about 75  of all sales for that morning and trust me its always pretty busy there which is why i have to do back ups every time  despite me being the new guy i'd say i have a decent amount of knowledge regarding work and how they try to use the  we are family here  stick  recently other finishers that do the same job i do have left everything we use to decorate the donut holes and shells empty or near empty so that i have to refill everything for me and them to use       my female boss  i have one male and one female  wrote me a note complaining that i need to refill everything and wash all the trays that we use  i talked to my male boss about how every time i come in the things we use are always empty as shit and that its not my job to wash the trays its the servers who literally get paid to take trays and plates front and back but they always dump them in the sink and leave to go chit chat in the front       i've talked to my male boss about 5-6 times about the same shit telling him that if i keep walking into this disarray of shit i'll just go home and we will be losing a good percentage of money for that morning til the male boss comes in to do the work himself  i believed in the working hard thing because it was my first job my a fellow co-worker told me that people in this job barely care  he even told me a story that the guy before me who worked there for about 10-15 years didn't give a damn and would just slap the shit on the donut and put it out and it would still sell       i usually prefer accuracy over speed because i felt like decorating the donuts was a form of art but today i decided to not give too many fucks and just go speed over accuracy  my shift is about 3 hours long but i stay an extra hour or two because i wanted to make sure i did a good job  today by just slapping things on the donuts i got out in about 2 hours and i've never felt better  i am going to be looking for another job before i quit this one  i've felt like i've tried everything to try and get them to make the other finishers restock things but it seems like its never gonna work  am i overreacting and should just suck it up because its apart of the finishers just to restock despite them not doing it or am i in the right for noticing the double standards that my female boss has for me but not the other finishers  ,pqju8h

Why not people with the intelligence to make a difference on the world?,sorry if this does not belong here  but i think it can speak volume about how school's basically this breeding ground for hierarchical elitism that is subject to be spread into the workplace  school doesn't care if you're bright minded  school doesn't care if you got ingenuity behind your back  school doesn't care if you're actually original and creative  school doesn't care about you being an innocent  contributing productive member of society no  on the contrary they want you to be a wageslave to worthless jobs that are going to be killed off by automation anyway in 10 years  what school cares all about you is being an obedient  mindless drone that looks 'badass' enough so that you can go out there and become another slave to the bureaucratic establishment  that's why if you don't have anything of value to school whether it be being an elite athlete or being a straight a student  they could care less about looking into other attributes you bring to the table  the prioritization of money and funds over academia and morals is self explanatory ,pqj2ts

2341,Employer wants me to work for 80%,hi  i'm fairly new to reddit  this subreddit was recommended to me for advice on an issue i am currently facing at my workplace  i  27f  have been working for a company for a couple of months as a part-time  casual worker   i received an email from my employer stating how the company is under financial hardship as a result of another lockdown  the company is now open for business again with employee's hours reduced  in the email they asked that i agree to receive only 80  of the hours that i work   i wasn't sure that i understood correctly and after talking to my partner and another family member about it  who both agreed that it doesn't sound right  i phoned one of the company's office staff   i explained that i was calling to gain a better understanding of what they were asking of me and they assured me that they were indeed asking me to agree to only receive 80  of my pay for hours that i actually work  i told them that i wasn't comfortable with that  to which they responded that they were disappointed in me  as 90  of the other employees had agreed to this and the remaining hadn't responded yet  i was caught off guard   i asked if my position will be jeopardised if i didn't agree  to which they said  no  however it is part of working as a team  they went on to explain how difficult things are at this time and suggested i find another business owner to talk to about it to maybe gain a better understanding of how hard things are right now for businesses  i explained that my other employer  who i also work part-time for  is paying me 100  and hadn't asked this of me  they ended the conversation by suggesting i call back when another office member is available to discuss it further   i have reached for out for legal advice and all have responded saying that it is immoral because if i am working  i should be paid 100  for hours i have worked  however my employer is within their legal right as i was given the option to agree or disagree   i feel like if i had the right to not agree to this  they should have been more professional and simply respected my response  accepted it and move on  rather than guilt trip me   i feel like how i was treated was manipulative  i'll now feel uncomfortable working alongside my colleagues knowing they are working for only 80  while i'd be earning 100  if i agreed to this  i would be earning well below minimum wage  i feel it is especially an unfair request as our hours are already decreased  i understand their business is struggling  but everyone is struggling right now   they are receiving financial aid from our government which is supposed to assist them with their employees wages  they are essentially asking us to work for free  and at the same time  they are receiving financial aid that they will not have to pay back   it feels unfair  my manager has told i am a great worker and that they value me  i know i have a lot to offer and have 9 years experience in my field   i feel insulted  stressed  disrespected and angry but at the same time i can't help but feel guilty   i appreciate any advice on how to go about this moving forward  thank you so much for taking the time to read this ,pqjmun

2345,When did companies stop accepting paychecks as a valid motivation for work?,the title may sound a bit confusing so let me explain   4 years ago  i was in my high school business class   which we didn't learn personal financial management in just fyi   our teacher was giving us a lesson on how to write a resume as part of an assignment in which we had to write a resume which he would review in a fake job interview  during this assignment  he made it very clear to us that when an employer asks us ''why do you want to work for this company''  saying ''i need a paycheck to support myself and my family'' is taboo and simply doesn't fly and i think most working people will agree that this is true   my question is  why   based on personal research  it seems that back in the say 1920s  every company understood that money was the only valid motivation for people to work  and explaining one's financial situation in a job interview was common    at some point in time  however  every employer decided that a good employee shouldn't be interested in the money but rather the ''experience'' of working and what services  they  can offer to the company instead of the other way around  in the warped world view of modern ceo's and store managers  an employee shouldn't be motivated by their paycheck but rather the ''honor'' of working for them   this worldview is illogical  sadistic  fundamentally destructive and downright biohazardous  and what really bugs me is how so many people simply don't question this bullshit and accept it as fact  when i  a young person complain about this illogical expectation from employers to my parents and grandparents  i'm treated like a ''dumb kid who simply doesn't know how the world works''    it's like  everyone agrees that working solely for a paycheck is taboo behavior but no one is able to explain why  just that it is and arguing against it is wrong   so my question is  when did employers start adopting this twisted worldview and why do so many people think it's ok ,pqce64

2389,Tricky situation with my co-worker,hello everybody  before i start in  i must say that this sub has been an excellent find and despite us all existing in a system we cannot stand it is of some solace that others feel the same way as myself    so a bit of backstory  i work in a small team with one other person and we are both very much anti-work so generally speaking  we work hard when we have to and ease up when we don't  after all the reward for hard work is just more work and that is no incentive   the problem is that recently they have completely given up on work  which i completely get because i feel the same way  however  the issue is that the vast majority  if not all the work within the department is now left to me alone    i can't really be mad at them because they are doing what in an ideal world we would both be doing and don't want to come off as being a whiney arsehole but this situation is causing myself to do the work of two people for less money than they are earning    am i being an arsehole for thinking this is unfair  or am i just being overly sensitive  envious and resentful that they can get paid for doing very little when i'm picking up the slack     they often will work from home  despite it being a job that the majority of which requires being physically on-site  and when they are working from home all this entails is them logging on and not even checking our e-mails  when this happens they often ask me to cover them in case management ask where they are  our manager is located in another office in a different city    do you have any advice on what i should do here  should i broach the subject or carry on in the hopes that they will realise that it is having a knock-on effect  i can't see how they aren't self-aware enough to recognise that i am carrying the workload for both of us    thanks ,ppwjap

2395,Sometimes I feel like laughing and crying at the same time,i heard a high school teacher say  well back in my day  we had 40 hours of school a week  it had its downsides  but it also had its upsides  students these days have it easy   note  i don't live in the us  nowadays the average high schooler has about 28 hours of class per week in their last year  certain sections have up to 36 hours   i don't know what's funnier  that this 50ish year old man thinks that  students going into a burnout  is a negligeable downside to shoving knowledge into their heads for 40 hours a week  the fact that he apparently thinks that this method of learning works  or the fact that he also suggested that students should work for 2 hours a day after school with all of that  also  i don't know if all of this is funny  depressing  or both ,pq1wn8

2399,Not a morning person,my wife and i live on the west coast and she was just recently made an offer by a small company based on the east coast for a 100  remote position   it was a very short interview process in which they didn't ask her for her resume  or any other normal type of interview questions   they kind of knew her from prior meetings from industry conferences but they have not talked to each other in over 5 years   i need to add that she has 20 years experience in her industry   she was scheduled to start this week but there were some other things that came up that delayed the start date that were completely normal     heres the wild part   during a brief phone call with one of the partners  she made a comment that she is  not a morning person   we have an elementary age child in which has  needs  every morning it seems and she mentions that there will probably be some interruptions during the 7a - 9a time block as we are getting him off to school   this came about because she was inquiring how they approach their days   this benign comment has now resulted in a suspension of the offer after a meeting was setup to clarify expectations in which my wife was trying to find out what their issues were   they made the offer  with the assumption that she would be expected to start at 5a pst every day as this was their primary  collaboration time    they did not convey any of this in the initial interview or offer    they explained that this collaboration time is phone calls with clients and other chats   texting in which she is not expected to be an active participant   she had offered to be as flexible as possible in the early hours  but currently cannot commit to zero interruptions and 100  participation in those really early morning hours and has stated that she would be most likely working til 5p pst every day    the result of the meeting was that  this wasn't something they had not considered before hand and needed to speak with their partners  who my wife has not interviewed with in any professional capacity   she hasn't heard back from them in two days   this whole process is so odd and i keep telling her that she is probably dodging a bullet by this falling through   how is it companies offering remote positions to people in other time zones are not accounting for the natural skew in the day when families and school age children are involved ,ppq1lg

2412,"""STOP"", a letter of immediate resignation.",good afternoon all      as requested by managernamehere  i was asked to explain why chose to reveal to the customers that i've interracted with in the past four days why i'm quitting the company  and the sad state of affairs with the migration project in general     keep in mind  this explanation comes hot on the heels of a very confrontational discussion with servicedeskoperationssupportmanagernamehere  in which he succeeded in making me breach my contractual agreement with scc in order to leave the company as quickly as possible  and ultimately absolve them of any responsibility     i feel a deep seated need to help people     whether that's due to the trauma i've suffered during my childhood with the lack of help from my neighbours when my parents were physically abusing me  or because it's my rationalization for the reason why i chose to stay alive on this planet     i know that life is nothing but a constant string of suffering  and i would have been better off not existing     but  since i'm here and able  i chose to help people    as such  when i came to scc  i was overwhelmed with the access i was suddenly provided     so many people coming to me to help them     so many personalities  so many individualities  so many souls  all of them in need of help  and i just happened to be there to help them     so many opportunities to do good in this world     it was great  for a while     then i discovered the ugly side of working for scc  or any tech support company in general     managers that do not care about the humanitarian aspect of the interactions we have with our clients     the comfort we bring our clients  the assurance that we can provide them with the assistance they so desperately crave  so that they can do their work with the tools we provide support for  and the joy the have in their voice when they leave satisfied at the end of the call  these are all footprints to what our managers are trying to turn us into     the managers are trying to turn us into tools  cold  unfeeling tools in their complicated and sometimes non-existant processes  all in service of their artificial indicators of performance  that have no actual meaning to us or the people that we work with     the managers want quantity  without hiring more people     the managers want quality  without training those people properly     the managers expect us to train ourselves  while they reap the benefits of good reviews that their subordinates receive     the managers start projects that last for months  maybe years  and when it finally starts  the project falls flat on it's face  causing suffering to hundreds  if not thousands of our clients     the managers either know the grief that our clients communicate to us and don't care  or they don't know  -because- they don't care     and then there's the suppliers we work with  they just flat out -don't- care     as a human being  when i talk to someone on the phone  i try to level with them     be straight  be honest  be human     i've developed this style of comunication for almost eight years  and it has never been an issue  up until i decided to quit scc  i talk to them like a friend  and i don't have any restraint  i let them know that i too am a human being  and that i too suffer in my continual existence  but that i want to channel it into helping them suffer less     i want to make them understand the human aspect of the issue they are facing  and why they are facing it  as far as i understand it  from my own human perspective  wether or not i'm autorized to divulge such details has never been my priority  however  upon requests from management  i did have to make adjustments from time to time  that however relies on management being aware of my behavior in the first place  which razvan grecu has confirmed that they were  but as long as it produced value to the company by building trust between the service desk and the clients that we interact with  they chose to let me continue     now that i want to leave  that value suddently dissappeared  because the  precedent  won't be there to maintain the level of trust     i told scc that i wanted to quit  due to medical reasons  as the stress i've accumulated has reached the limit of what i am capable of enduring     an enlarged liver  caused in the msot part by the stress i've experienced working for scc  although part of it could also be caused by my declining relationship with my parents  culminating in my father's death from heart and lung cancer  this very same enlarged liver that is pressing into my rib cage  reducing my lung capacity  and making it difficult for me to concentrate  in spite of my pre-existing adhd condition     i did not at the time mention that what recently spiked this stress was my due to managernamehere repeatedly asking me to split my weekend in twain  despite it being in breach of romanian law     for the sake of my sanity  and for there to not be any legal repercussions  i expressed my need for two days of uninterrupted rest  and was repeatedly denied that opportunity during negociations  finally  after several discussions  we reached an agreement  and they dropped the subject of my working during saturday all together     i was even generous enough to suggest my departure on october 1st  because i was vaguelly aware of two weeks being a courtesy  again  managernamehere decided to correct me  by stating that i had to give them 21 work days of notice before my departure  even though again  it's in breach of romanian law     so now  out of the blue  my down to earth  sincere communication style with the clients  about how the migrationprojectnamehere is a sad joke  and how we're severly understaffed  and how i'm actually planning to leave because i can't take this anymore  was brought into the spotlight  why  because scc wants me gone without them suffering any consequences     scc never cared about my health  when i had a work accident in december of 2018  where i twisted my neck and had to wear a neck brace  they shut me up  they upgraded my privatehealthcareprovidernamehere plan so that i could afford to do an mri that was required for the medical investigations  apparently  after working for scc for almost five years at that point  it hadn't -earned- that healthcare plan  until -after- my injury  so they could then -use- it as hush money     when i went to the doctor to investigate my shortness of breath in autumn of 2020  i was financially reprimanded by my manager at the time for  being late  even though my absence was communicated in advance  and the delays present in the romanian healthcare system  in particular those that exist even when having appointments  were well known  i wasn't even granted a full week of leave to continue my medical investigations  instead being forced to accept only 3 days between november 16th and 18th  resulting in me having to return to work thursday  november 19th   the day after my liver problem diagnosys  which coincided my own birthday  all because the team that i worked for then was -also- severly understaffed to be able to handle my absence     i've been trying to make changes in my diet and my life style  and all i needed was just some stability on behalf of my workplace  instead  servicedeskoperationssupportmanagernamehere   either from his own will  or directed by his superiors  has moved me from project to project since february of 2021  after working for project2 for three years  i was moved to project3  then when the project was over  back to project2 for just a couple of days  before being transfered again to project4  then project5  then project6  then a bit of project7  then more project6  then a bit of project8  then a bit more project3  then more project8     i got tired of being moved around willy-nilly  and i seized the opportunity to apply to an open position for project6  within minutes  i was contacted by my project7 managernamehere about why i haven't consulted him before applying  a couple of days  i was contacted by supervisornamehere  who tried to provide a peace offer by providing a job at project9  being human and failible  i accepted  and in about two weeks  the whole project9 went under due to lack of funding  and so  i returned to project7  where i continued to sit in silence  without being contacted to be trained thoroughtly  left to my own devices for days and days  only taking stray calls from people that happened to call the service desk by accident     and then the migration project began  and as you already know  it's a disaster     these are but a sampling of my experiences that influenced my decision to share details with the customers about the situation they're in  and how hard i'm trying to help them     but as a human being  even i have limits  and despite how much i hate that i have to do this  much like a plane that's currently losing oxygen and crashing  i have to put my own oxygen mask on before i help others  even if the plane is going to crash anway     after my argument with servicedeskoperationssupportmanagernamehere however  i decided to jump out of the plane entirely     as such  please consider this my last scc comunication  i will be shutting down my equipment for the last time  and head towards hq to deposit my equipment     i would have liked to say that these past 7 years and eight months have been fun  but scc took advantage of my addiction towards helping people  and have been edging me closer and closer to this day when i finally say stop     kind regards  wally hulea   project7 1st line analyst   your feedback is very important to us  please

2460,It all comes down to this 1 fundamental paradigm shift in how we think about work,as long as most people view it as natural  inescapable  sensible and acceptable that they are forced to work in order to be allowed to live - we aren't going to get anywhere   but you have to work  people in nature before money had to work  who's gonna pay for your life  you are just lazy  other people shouldn't have to work to house and feed you   no you are not getting the picture  technology  science and automation   people need to realize that if modern science and technology was to be properly applied with the clear and direct social aim of automating as much work as technically possible outside of money and market inventive but only the inventive of emancipating the human species from drudgery  while of course eradicating many unnecessary arbitrary nonsensical life wasting jobs that shouldn't exist to begin with from a rational sane point of view - and thus we would setting humans free to do as they please with their limited time on this planet - we could have a vastly different kind of society  to say the least    amp x200b   you accepting that 8-12 hours of your day is dedicated to earning an elaborate arbitrary man made fiction called money which you are forced to obtain to eat food and sleep inside is utterly grotesque  and people in nature did not work in that sense    they found food and built some shelter etc  but plenty of archeological study indicates that in terms of actual free leisure  fun  socializing etc  human life was vastly more free 12 000 years ago in the age before agriculture in the slow climb towards the current monstrosity of global human industrial civilization began    amp x200b   now here we are with 8 people with more money than half the worlds population and billion people in abject poverty and 25 000 people starving to death every single day and those not starving working mostly nonsense destructive life wasting jobs 8 hours a day with the threat of starving if they don't  thinking they are free living in a democratic country based on liberty ,ppor5z

2501,"Got Fired After 13 Years, Can't Find More Work, Won't Find More Work",so i'm on the high functioning end of the spectrum and i worked for a special outfit  a nonprofit in minnesota that has a thrift store that  provides a therapeutic workplace environment for people with mental disabilities and handicaps  funny thing about it is that they don't actually care who had what diagnosis or how best to interact with them nor are they made to  they just hire disabled people  exploit them  and get super rich off of selling donated goods they didn't even pay to get  all while telling the populace that  it's for a good cause  a cause they don't even truly care about  we all made minimum wage and weren't even called  employees  they called us  clients  despite our biweekly pay  while boss man got to go camping at the florida keys every year  you better believe they're fighting to keep their right to pay subminimum wage at their other facilities  signs and chanting and everything      over the course of a baker's dozen years  i did a lot of things for these people  i suppose i was stupid at first and bought into the hype of having a job  authored their facebook  provided excellent customer service  kinda became lowkey famous around the small town this all took place in because everyone liked how i did things and kept wanting to ask the secret to my success and such  even very smart people were mistaking me as one of the managers  i was a superstar      boss man was not  that never sat well with him  he didn't like being upstaged by an autistic guy  then again  he's a pretty insecure dude anyhow  constant pathological lying  never honest about his emotions or much of anything really  anger issues  well those anger issues started spiraling out of control  he'd start yelling and screaming at the handicapped employees in public  it would wind up in situations where i'd just be standing there with a customer at the jewelry case and sure enough he's on a ladder looking down at another employee screaming like  no  don't tell me what the rules are  i make the rules here  hey  we're not done  get back here  i'll tell you when we're done  and me and this other customer are just awkwardly watching this whole thing  he also seemed to love chasing people out of the store  especially during mask mandate season when he would just march up to people asking them if they had masks with them and practically glower at them and lean forward while stepping closer to them until they left  one time a dude just casually mentioned that i must be the one operating the facebook  boss man took that personally and widened his eyes and raised his voice going  he's a cashier  and leaned forward and stepped slowly towards the dude  dude's like  i was just saying-  and he got cut off by boss man again yelling  he's a cashier  as he stepped towards him some more  eyes still widened  dude has issues      as it would go on over the next several months  boss man would just get worse  he'd come into work clearly upset about something  dragging his anger around  becoming more and more dismissive in his responses to jokes or much of anything  really ruined the atmosphere  kept yelling and screaming at other employees  eventually i cracked and i wanted something done about it  i reported to his manager  the executive director aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they fired me  for wanting him to be held accountable for his actions  they said  well  you don't respect the hierarchy around here and you don't seem to be happy  unfortunately we have to terminate your employment  boss man then screamed at me more right in front of the executive director  called me silly for trying to speak and explain my story  and then chased me out the back door and shut the door behind me  he clearly enjoyed this      i've tried to find work elsewhere  it's been about a month and a half  town's been crying about the labor shortage  pizza hut and such can't stay open because they can't get staff to work and such  a brand new simonson's gas station opened its doors  i put my applications in and  pretty much nothing  one grocery store offered me the job but they also offered way too many hours and wanted me to work nights and such and  well that's a no  especially with my social security i can't make too much money  other grocery store did an interview and said no  walgreens didn't even interview they just said no  other places didn't even call back  over a dozen years of relevent experience and that's not good enough for them  but you'd better believe they're still on about how  nobody wants to work  as they continue to cry about the labor shortage      so  for right now anyway  i am part of the great resignation  i've stopped looking for work  i've got my social security checks so i'm not incomeless  i just  have a hard time getting out there and doing something and meeting people  but i'm not incomeless and if they're gonna be that exclusionary about stuff in their hiring practice then honestly  i have no sympathy for them and their labor shortage  plus with covid still raging strong  i feel like this is all gonna get worse before it gets better

2504,Why aren’t employers required to pay workers comp for work induced mental health damages?,you break a finger at work  or get some work related injury and boom- your work compensates you for it    why don t they provide compensation for work place induced depression or anxiety that may arise  it seems like a sufficient way to at least somewhat improve working conditions and allow for better work life balances    i suppose an obvious rejection of this would be  well it s not always measurable that you are depressed because of work  yet workers comp for physical injuries does not either  obviously if you break your back at work  one can say with certainty that the injury took place at work  but instances of back pain are not always measurable and are still covered under workers comp ,pphr08
2505,My husband is being punished for being out sick...and during a pandemic at that.,so my husband s job uses the  stupid  point system and he just informed me last night about his newly accrued points that he  earned  a couple weeks ago from leaving work early sick  and then being out the next 3 days  still sick    he was so sick that we both thought he had covid  and if not covid  then the flu  i took him to get tested and it came back negative for covid  so it must have been the flu  but it doesn t really matter to me what it was  he was down for a whole week and in the 9 years i ve known him  he s never been as sick as he was  so  no matter what virus he contracted  he was too sick to work and it s not something you want to spread in a business whose main customer base is the elderly  so on top of not getting paid because of being out sick  he gets punished with points    the absolute bullshit of it all is astounding ,ppiuoh

2522,So I think I might be quitting soon...,tl dr  either i'm working from home or i'm working for someone else              not sure if this is the right place for this  not sure if  anywhere  is   so at my workplace we've been working from home since march 2020 uninterrupted  the whole initiative was done at the drop of a hat  we literally manhandled our ratty old tower pcs and monitors into our cars  those that  had  them anyways  and drove home  this was at 3pm that day  we were expected to be online and logged in by 4pm to finish the day 'as normal' by 5pm   i mention this not to garner sympathy  but to give you a hint as to the kind of company this is   they sat on their asses and did nothing for the six weeks running up to the first lockdown  in the uk  and suddenly it was  our  responsibility to make sure we didn't miss a single  picosecond  of work that arose from their mandates   my manager saw me struggling with a monitor under each arm and said to me  don't you want to take your loose paperwork folder  said folder was a collection of needlessly printed-off versions of documents that were saved on our internal servers and backed up in germany  their ultimate fate was to be filed in a cupboard somewhere never to be seen again  how do i know that  in the 18-odd months since   nobody has asked about them   he 'helped' me tuck the folder in with one of the monitors under my left arm and sent me on my way   they've been in a bag under the stairs since that day   in the first two months  i filled up my car's petrol tank exactly  once  i did the same work  to the same standard  to the same timeframe  i just woke up an hour later  shared a cup of coffee and some conversation with my partner  and logged in from the box room office   some have no doubt had some very negative experiences in lockdown  but i don't count myself among them  with the money we saved over that time  we've cobbled together enough for a house deposit on a wonderful home that we now own  with the time we've saved on commutes  we've cooked better  more intricate meals  with the mental energy i've saved  i've connected with my friends and family   when i was in the office  i took two diazepam a day and periodically excused myself to find a quiet toilet to vomit into  the anxiety i felt there was a palpable  oppressive force that was beginning to physically  rot  me from the inside out   some might consider me weak and unsuited to living in the 'real' world because of my failure to control that fear and self-loathing  sometimes i think that myself   either way  i mention it only to say that my time working from home is peaceful  i can be nervous  or melancholic  or happy or socially catatonic  i can care for myself and for my partner  i can protect us from an outside world that seems to actively take  pleasure  in harming us   so naturally  my workplace said a few weeks back that they want all of us  back at our desks  by the end of september   why  they haven't told us why  scuttlebutt from the more sympathetic among management hints that the upper crust of the company want us there because  they just want us there   no financial reason  we know we've been bringing in more money for the company than we were at the office   we were told by our direct manager that  no  flexible working arrangements would be considered for anyone in our team  incidentally  we are the lowest paid team in the building if that surprises anyone   a colleague pipes up  she's looking after her very sickly mother who can no longer care for herself  can she have any degree of flexible working   no   another speaks  she's very ill with long-covid  her mother died of it and she's immunocompromised  can she have any degree of flexible working   no   the call was ended  and that was that   i promise it isn't  all  doom and gloom though   see  in the uk if you've worked at a company for more than two years  you gain a greater degree of workplace protection  you can make an official flexible working request  and the company is legally compelled to give you a hearing   they have to sit in front of you and physically  tell you  why you can't work from home  why it isn't at all possible   without so much as a single shared word between us   every single member of our team  made a flexible working request that very day  we heard that there were dozens of other requests made across other teams and locations at the same time   as of today  the return to the office has been officially  postponed  for at least a month while they 'assess the situation'   the email from the director says they're 'waiting for government guidelines'  managers say they've received such an influx of fwrs that the hr team will need the extra month just to work through them all   frankly  as heartening as it was to see the entire company  convulse  in panic at the actions of the plebes at its base  i don't realistically think it will change anyone's mind   i think they'll spend the next few weeks desperately contriving a reason to say no that won't pose some legal threat to them   i think they'll devote every neuron to the task of getting us back into that hateful asbestos-filled cube   if they tell me that they can't offer the option of working from home  i'm quitting   right then and there   i thought i'd be more frightened  but honestly i feel  relief   i play the conversation out in my head whenever i need to cheer myself up   i'll work my notice from home  if not  come collect your shit  i've left it in the car park ,ppkcsr

2540,My American Work Story (TLDR version),i am not a capitalist  but for a long time  i have been in a variety of roles that defend the interest of capital     for those of you in the true working class  you've likely interacted with me or somebody like me during your time in the workforce  and probably muttered  fuck you  under your breath as i walked away   this story is for you   if you're like me  a member of the  professional managerial class  then perhaps parts of my story might sound familiar   i'm the dipshit from the office upstairs who slaps band-aids on barely functioning machinery just to get a shipment out of the door   that work order you've been sweating on for half the day to throw away a bunch of shit that looks perfectly fine   i am the dude who does the math on when it becomes profitable to landfill literal miles of good materials   i've been there with a stopwatch  timing you and your partner on your tasks so that management can decide if one of you is unnecessary   capitalism produces innovation  they say   i was well-paid to develop a product that closely mimicked a competitor's patent claims  but legally  fell outside their description of its construction   we then turned around and made the market even less competitive by rolling out our own patent   it wasn't some big event like the loss of a job that woke me up to what i was doing   i had always considered myself liberal  but becoming a leftist came from my observations in the workforce   a coworker who was chronically late because he was caring for a sick relative got let go when hr audited attendance and found out local management was covering for him   workers with 10  20  30 years of experience and loyalty were shown the door under pandemic cost-cutting measures   a foreman was abusing his power and influence to sleep with his direct reports on the shop floor   truck drivers were forced to pencil whip their logs to get to the next job  those who refused were put through progressive discipline and fired   the list goes on and on  and despite all of this casual cruelty  the same people were always stepping out of the same luxury vehicles into the same plush  lifeless offices  clothed in the same designer workwear and clutching the same posh leather messenger bags  with the same question  what have you done for me lately   in my view  things are the way that they are because the working class has been successfully divided   people like me have been deluded into thinking that because they are elevated above their peers  in terms of pay  benefits  work-life balance  workplace status etc  the system is working for them   nothing could be further from the truth  in my view   stratifying the workplace like this is by design  not accident  and the resentment it causes keeps labor from unifying to demand its fair share of the pie   things are not going well in the world right now  and i see a lot of posts asking  what can i do   i think that every person's situation is different  but in general  you need to figure out what small actions you can take to be in solidarity with your fellow workers   support unions and strike efforts   don't be a scab   identify and shut down pro-capitalist propaganda  it's subtle  and there's a lot of it on reddit   for my part  it's been nearly a year since a combination of boredom  apathy  and disgust caused me to step away from what i was doing and critically examine my life   i am privileged to be able to do this   i am not sure what is next - i don't have infinite resources  and at some point  i will need to work again   as somebody without a house  kids  debt  or many real obligations  i think the best way i can help to change things is to take a service-sector or manufacturing job and start trying to agitate for worker rights   what do you think  reddit   i want to hear your stories ,ppja6z

2547,"I thought about it a bit, and I realized that I am quite happy at my job now.",less than a month ago i was depressed  maybe a little suicidal  and had absolutely no energy to do anything  let alone clean  i had trouble sleeping  felt sick all the time  with frequent headaches  nausea  the works  i had been with this company  working in this inbound call center from home  for almost a year now  and i'm still a contractor  that means no pto  no sick days  no holiday pay  no benefits of any sort  they keep dangling that carrot in front of me  recently  they changed the position on all of us  it used to be one line of business lob  for eleven states  which wasn't bad  since the information was easy to find  and it was all laid out clear as day  texas was the state that called the most  followed closely by cali  but they took us all off the phones for a week of  training  added two new lob's for them  and expected us to maintain the same level of output  it went from maybe six to seven minutes between calls  to maybe one minute  and it wasn't like we just answered the call and gave them what they wanted  assuming that the information for the other two lob's could be found  let alone deciphered  there were notes that needed to be taken  files that sometimes needed to be sent  emails to be written  and unsurprisingly  no extra pay  no raises  not even for the direct employees  it eventually became too much  and despite the fact that i was already on thin ice due to using up all of my upto sick days  i took a week and a couple of days off  i didn't do a damn thing during this time  just slept and fucked around on steam and shit  eventually  the feelings of anxiety left me  and i felt like i could at the very least log in and try to make sure i at least had enough for another month of rent   while setting everything up on the day i came back  i had a realization  i was using a physical phone that the client sent to all of the agents for this company  instead of a virtual phone  there was a button that i pressed when i needed to make an outbound call usually when i get disconnected from whomever i was speaking with  and i remembered that one day i accidentally tapped it while stretching  and the time between calls was about double than normal  think two minutes instead of one between calls  so on a whim  i pressed that button once every few seconds for about half an hour  not one call came in  the outbound call button effectively reset my position in the queue to receive a call  i tested to see what the average time between calls were the following hour  and surmised that i had maybe a minute and some seconds from one call to the next  so i hit that button as close to a minute as possible   it's been about a week now  i haven't done a goddamn thing since i came back  save for a few calls i let through  just to keep my qa scores consistent  i feel as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders  i'm not feeling drained from talking with these people who ask really fucking dumb questions that tell me they didn't even try to look up the information themselves before calling  honestly  the hardest thing i do now is hit that stupid button  i have the energy to clean  i'm not mentally fried  i almost want to say i feel great  hell  typing this out has been a little cathartic  the only thing bothering me now is having to wake up at five in the morning  but i think i can manage to do that now   i have no idea how long i can get away with this  but i am gonna milk it for all it's worth  i'm kinda looking forward to work now ,pplmq6

2552,I can't imagine why the service industry has a 'labor shortage',i'm sure that you've all got plenty of these to add to the list but i've spent the last year and change making a mental list of situations that show  exactly  why so many people are bolting from the service industry  retail  restaurant  etc  in droves and we have the so-called labor shortage  between terrible pay and equally awful management customers  is it really any surprise   i've got four that immediately come to mind  mostly because they're instances that constantly seem to repeat themselves to varying degrees of stupidity       1  employee s child has to have an urgent surgery and requests the scheduled day off  manager tells employee to either schedule the urgent surgery around pre-scheduled days off or find someone else to take the kid to their appointment  and then wonders why the employee quits on the spot  2  customer comes into a busy restaurant to place a to-go order  server politely informs them that the kitchen is currently out of x and offers y instead  rather than adjust the order  the customer proceeds to loudly berate the server  including swearing  name-calling  and otherwise poor manners  and demands the whole order be free   better yet  manager gives it to them and shrugs off the behavior  server is expected to  let it roll off  because that is  unfortunately  business as usual  3  an irate customer enters a gas station with a complaint that the gas pump isn t taking their credit card  the gas station attendant explains that they ve put their card in wrong  uses the examples posted right on the pumps as reference  and also offers to help them prepay for their fuel instead  customer throws their card at the attendant  yelling and cursing about incompetence  while demanding the assistance that the attendant already offered  the attendant runs their card  the same way posted on the examples  and the system accepts it with no issues  it s still the attendant s fault  though  bonus points if they come back on the next shift to complain about the helpful attendant  double points if the next customer is a drive off  that s the attendant s fault too  4  retail associate is restocking shelves and returning items that customers decided they didn t want at the last minute  while doing so  a customer approaches  initially for assistance and then continues to follow the associate around the store  making lewd suggestive comments  grabbing at the associate's hand arm to get them to pay attention  and all around making the associate uncomfortable  customer gets unreasonable when the associate doesn t give them the attention they re demanding  they really just want to get their job done and go home  manager may or may not ask the customer to leave  most likely associate will just have to find somewhere in the store a little more populated to put distance between them and hope for the best ,ppjczi

2580,Overdraft fees when you're broke anyway,i know it's not related to work  but kinda  i already make minimum wage  it's hard enough to live on that  now  when i need the money i don't have for something important  i accidentally get an overdraft per transaction of a  35 fee  not just the negative amount i used making the transaction  does anyone else think this is crooked  or is it just me  i don't mind paying back the amount i took out  but damn that is a lot to me if i only bought something that cost  1 50 and the overdraft fee is  35  it feels like some sort of punishment for not having enough money ,ppgpi0

2591,Having a job vs. Traditional Slavery - A few thoughts on the matter:,slavery  you have to work to be allowed to live or avoid being beaten up as punishment's and your slave master will give you food and shelter in exchange for your labor  you also likely live pretty much where you work  no commute to worry about at least   having a job  you have to work to be allowed to live but you also have to figure out buying food and finding affordable shelter yourself with the money afforded to you by your employer in exchange for your many hours of labor  and you have to get to and from there  and spend time and money and effort to deal with all that   in some ways  being a slave is advantageous  at least you don't have to waste time hunting for an apartment or going food shopping and paying a bunch of bills etc  those basics would all be taken care of by your slave master    to just pay workers a minimum wage and then have the workers figure everything out themselves in terms of basic sustenance and housing - is almost easier than to actually have to take care of all that for the slaves that are working for you    maybe in certain basic areas we are in fact less free than slaves  because we have to deal with a bunch of annoying  stressful side hassle that a slave would simply be given outright in exchange for their forced labor   the labor for income paradigm is just a convoluted and messy way organizing this basic premise  work or starve   slavery is at least more direct and honest about that    amp x200b   what's the difference between a full time prison guard and someone in prison    the prisoner doesn't have to pay a mortgage or rent and have to deal with the hassle of daily commuting ,ppk227

2593,Walked out and now they’re holding back my paycheck, the title says it how it is  i quit my retail job last week after my management pulled the last straw  i started this job a few months ago and didn t mind it much as i was able to mostly keep to myself and managed a lot of productivity  the downside of working independently was i got little to no training or guidance from managers  i thought i could handle it for a few months until i relocate but then i started realizing how disorganized and unprofessional management at the store is  most of the managers were buddy buddy with each other which is great and all but when employees approached them for guidance their demeanor immediately changed  they expected 110  from their employees yet had practically no idea what they were doing when it came down to actually performing their tasks  i would be scolded for not throwing out a small area of trash i was not ordered to do before leaving  30 minutes after i was supposed to clock out  only to watch the same manager who scolded me turn around and leave a table full of trash for me when he clocked out  anyways incidences like these continued to turn me off of the job until one day the store manager walks into the area where i was working alone and snaps at me over having an ear bud in and told me i wasnt working hard enough  this was never something i was told not to do and in fact was encouraged by numerous other managers to have it on me in case they contacted me through the walkie-talkie system  i decided then that i was not interested in being in such a disorganized working environment while being held to such an insanely high standard for a minimum wage paycheck  i did not announce my departure to any managers as i did not see any for the rest of my shift and did not return for my next shift and was not contacted by anyone from the store since  fast forward a bit and the day my last paycheck is due to arrive comes and i check my bank account to see that my paycheck has been  reversed   upon researching online i found out that i am apparently supposed to go back to the store to collect my last paycheck so they can perform an  exit interview  i m very upset because i was never informed about this policy during my time working there and i am dreading going back to that store  if anyone has any advice i d really appreciate it ,ppis6r

2595,I quit the job I thought I always wanted after 6 weeks.,i was offered wfh initially  i thought it might be good to go into the office for a week to learn some things  however after that wfh was off the table  if ever i wanted to wfh it was considered a day off  even with covid symptoms i was asked to go in  i was quizzed and pressed for 2 hours on where to get an urgent test  telling me to go in  then telling me to go home when i m on my way in  then telling me to go back into the office when i m home  when i dared wfh another time  i took a shit and didn t take my work laptop with me  some guy that was supposed to be my colleague  but was the ex manager and bitter about it  this guy started accusing me of being untrustworthy  asking where the hell i was  shouting at me to go straight back to my laptop  and trying to investigate every little thing i d done that day  whether i d actually had permission to wfh  i did  he also knew i did  when he realised i didn t do anything wrong he reported me to my actual manager  saying i was away for 30 minutes  it was half that time  i quit the same day  that bullshit daily  the rushed training where they basically told me the answers to the exam to rush me into it so they could give me the biggest workload  for my training  god forbid i get anything wrong though  taking work home  a  flexible  hours system where you can only build up time for 2 weeks until it stops  but you have to give a weeks notice to actually use it  and having to have multiple perfect suits  shirts  ties and shoes was absolutely not worth the dogshit  10 50 an hour they had the audacity to offer  that s not even getting into the actual job requirements    i never loved the idea of the job  but i thought i d be good at it and i could just get on  it ended up being the opposite of what i wanted  i don t have the patience for this bullshit anymore    i ve gone through thinking i m just being unreasonable  that i was lazy  that normal work is like this and i should get used to it  but i cant  if  normal  work is like this i d rather be lazy than live and present myself like i m a fucking attorney on less than  2 above minimum wage per hour ,ppcetm

2603,Has any job you've worked for not had a toxic work environment?,i got a job as a receptionist in a medical office right out of university  the first day i wasn't greeted kindly and  without any training  put right into  intake  where i was expected to greet the arriving patients and  check  them into the office so the doctor could see them and know what they were there for  i was responsible for this first contact with the patients but i had no idea how to use their computer systems and fumbled a lot  it's a lot of pressure when you're trying to learn a confusing system with a person staring at you  waiting to be told they can go and sit down  since i didn't have proper training  or any  i made mistakes  my co-workers would get very angry and mouthy with me about the mistakes i was making   we are so busy and understaffed  we can't deal with mistakes  they would say   so i tried to learn as quickly as possible  the office was very busy since 8 different doctors worked there and we were severely understaffed  each doctor also required some differences in how the patients were check in  which was really confusing  once i got the hang of how to  check  patients in i had to learn all the little quirks and desires of each individual doctor   i know you usually do this but dr  blank wants us to do this instead  it's not that hard ok    i had been hired along with another woman who was performing the same tasks as i  she was clearly overwhelmed and made a pretty severe mistake that was socially and professionally unacceptable  but understandable considering no one told us about the proper thing to do within that specific and important situation  despite our short-staffed situation she was fired that evening in a very loud and dramatic way by the manager  they had a shouting match and the manager said to her  you are completely replaceable  we don't need you    after this mistreatment of my co-worker i was given a  1 raise  as i was getting my extra  1 an hour the manager was acting like it was this huge deal and that i should be grateful for it   i am very impressed with you  she said   keep up the good work  now i was the only one who was doing  intake  and it was very overwhelming since all my other co-workers were too busy to answer my questions and treated me like i was bothering them if i tried to get their input  no one was  training  me   additionally  the working environment was very toxic  my co-workers were over-worked and always angry and moody  they would constantly remind me that i was replaceable and mock mistakes i made  they would lecture me about things and when i asked if i was getting lectured because i was doing it wrong or because they were just reminding me they would say things like   well i'm just reminding everyone  you haven't done it wrong yet  it was like they didn't trust me to be a functioning  professional person  i locked myself in the bathroom on many occasions and cried because i was so overwhelmed but i didn't know what i could do since i really needed the money   the nail in the coffin for me was how they expected us to do overtime  in the interview i was told that they would  sometimes require overtime  but after i was hired i was told i shouldn't make any plans after my shift ended because sometimes the doctor's appointments ran late and if patients were still there i couldn't leave  this made my social and home-life super challenging  since over-time happened nearly every day and i was already working a solid 40 hours a week i typically worked an extra 6 hours a week  if not more  i was told to not log my over-time hours while at work  apparently that looked bad  and i that i should only log them after i got home  so more time i was expected to devote to this company   for instance  they would schedule me till 7pm but i would usually not leave the office till about 8 30-9 and then i would be scheduled to open the office the next morning at 7am sharp   you have to pay your do's  they told me  i had to cancel plans with friends and family because i was always working long hours and i never had time to shop for groceries  clean my house  or anything else we need to do in order to  you know  live   the doctors at the office were also completely awful to me  they were entitled and really rude  in addition to  intake  of patients  i was also expected to get the doctor's exam rooms ready for their visits with the patients  if i was lucky i'd get to this task before the patient was in the room but sometimes i would be cleaning and preparing the room while someone watched me  it made me uncomfortable   one time i made a  mistake  but it wasn't really a mistake because the information hadn't been communicated to me  i was supposed to type the doctors user names into the computer in the exam rooms so all the doctor had to do when they got into the exam room was type in their password  i typed one doctor's username incorrectly and he chewed me out for it in front of a patient  he called me names and told me it  wasn't that hard to get it right  ok  it was super condescending and i could tell he enjoyed mocking and belittling me in front of someone  the patient came to me after and apologized on the doctor's behalf  that was really rude and i'm sorry he spoke to you like that  she said   i was so burnt out after working there for only a few months  but that's when they started to add more tasks to my day because people were quitting  surprise right   they treated their staff like shit  had no respect for our personal lives  and  because the pay was decent  thought they could just hire new people if we left  i quit before my 3 month period was up  i was completely fed up with being treated so poorly by everyone at the office  there was no kindness  the patients suffered long wait times and rude receptionists because we had so much work to do and working in  around medicine is a high-pressure job  there are so many other awful things that happened but in order to address them all i'd need to write an entire f-ing novel   this was one of the worst office's i worked for but every other office i worked for had similarities to this one and i was miserable at each job  everyone was understaffed  overworked  and expected to do over-time to  make up  for the short staffing situation  for context  we needed 8 receptionists to keep the office running smoothly but only had 4 or 5    amp x200b   tldr  i worked in a very toxic office where i wasn't trained  was belittled and mocked for making mistakes  and forced to work long hours with so much overtime i couldn't plan my life around my work ,ppjjdz

2623,Do NOT make your job dependent on you,it will do nothing but hurt you  you won't be appreciated for your hard work and reliability or anything  if anything  your co-workers and supervisors will only expect more from you and get angry if you dare to ask for anything  work a different shift  not work close as often  etc   twice now i have made the mistake of making myself too available and overstretching myself to help out my fellow co-workers  as a result  they now expect me to work more hours than i can honestly handle right now  i'm talking almost full time hours every week  with part time benefits and pay  my availability also gets ignored even though i have put it in waaaaay ahead of time multiple times  i've also told them that i am taking 17 credits at college right now  and obviously do not have the time to work full time hours  and made it clear from the beginning that i wanted to work part time because i would be going to school full time    now they continue to schedule me outside of my availability and expect me to work 30  hours a week  while many of my other co-workers work far less hours every week and have nothing going on outside of work  they are clearly only working here for the discount they can get on clothes  and yesterday  one of my supervisors was livid because i admitted that i needed to limit my availability more and that currently  some of the shifts i'm working is impeding on my ability to finish school work obligations more than i thought they would  because i thought they would have maybe been more considerate of that when i told them i was going to school for the twentieth time  the fact that i have even done well on quizzes and get homework turned in on time is a miracle  but any time i spend for leisure is time i end up wasting because i could have studied for another quiz and now i'm behind    i don't see myself getting anything out of this  and because i refuse to come in for extra shifts because of school and am finding it harder and harder to keep up with current shifts because of  again  school  i feel like i won't even get a good reference for this job either  in other words  outside of needing the money i earned to pay for stuff i actually need  i live with my parents but they aren't exactly financially reliable at this point  i don't see myself getting anything out of this except for lots of stress  and my co-workers and supervisors seem to like me less and less and yet expect me to work more and more   i'll try to talk to them again about school and possibly working less hours  but i'm going to be honest  now that the fasfa is offering me a grant for covid relief  this came out of nowhere  work is becoming much less appealing than ever  and might not even be necessary at this point  and my dad finally found a job that he might stick with  he is more limited physically and needs a sit down job and finally found one  so i can see myself quitting by january  i'm sick of being guilt tripped for needed time for school  i'm sick of being overworked  and even if i do also want time for leisure as well  so what  humans quite literally need down time  it's not healthy to work what is basically the equivalent of 80 hours a week  and for such a sad wage too   so yeah  don't do extra work for a job and be more adamant about your wants and needs right from the beginning  they're only going to bully you otherwise because guess what  they don't care about you unless you're their friend or related to someone they like  record your schedule and timecard and such because they will try to pull some funny stuff on you too  also  don't let your supervisor's problems be yours  they aren't and they never will be  if you're only getting a crappy  11 25 an hour wage  you're under no obligation to care or put yourself through so much stress for them    some people do get the things they want from a job and with such little work too ,pp2u6q

2632,I feel lost,this time three months ago  i finally felt like i had a purpose in this world  before that  i'd vaguely settled on something in psychology  but i was struggling with balancing college and an overbearing work environment  but then i moved  got a job i actually believed in for the first time  and thought life had finally started to make a bit of sense  and no  the job didn't screw me over  my manager was incredibly helpful  my coworkers were great  and the environment was fine  if a bit stressful at times just due to the nature of it all  but i left the company after a month  for context  i worked in the residence at a facility caring for kids with special needs  many of whom had trouble caring for themselves in even the most basic of capacities  the problem  as i discovered  was that kids who are nonverbal or semi-verbal develop different and sometimes complex cues  for someone who already struggles with social cues  that quickly became an issue  i can't point to a singular thing that went wrong  and obviously due to confidentiality rules i have to be somewhat vague  but i can say that  despite trying my best  i would sometimes misread situations  and spent minutes on end responding to the wrong problems  or i'd be too slow on the uptake prior to one of them getting upset and lashing out  and so it was kind of agreed upon mutually that it was best if i tried to find a different line of work  but that if a position opened up at the facility in a less hands-on division  the door would be left open to me    the long and the short of it is that i suspect  although i can't be sure because it's incredibly difficult and expensive to get a diagnosis for it as an adult  that i may have some less severe form of autism  that has put a stop to my life  because it's forced me to reconsider how i approach the world  why i chose the path i chose  and where i go from there  and the answer i've come to at the end of it all is simply that i don't know  i don't know what i want to do with my life  i don't even know what i can do  droning  repetetive tasks understimulate and bore me  manual labor quickly aggrivates my back  which thanks to a fun birth defect is missing a vertibrae  meaning it's a touch misshapen and very prone to pain  i'm too honest for sales work  blood and guts and bodies gross me out  so i can't be a doctor  and  as i'm learning with my foray into clerical work  i find office life incredibly painful and tedious    i feel lost  i have no direction  my most stable employment in the last two months has been a ten-day receptionist gig that leaves me with little to do but wallow in silence and self-hatred all day  until the phone rings and interrupts the tedium for one or two minutes at a time  i don't care about enjoying work anymore  i just want something that doesn't leave me walking away every day with nothing more than an aching spine and a deep desire to simply not wake up the next day  i came so tantalizingly close to having that once  and now that it's gone  i just feel lost and empty again  maybe even more so  because i know now what it's like to have that sense of purpose and direction ,pp1ls5

2683,The pitfalls of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan,i read another poster's tale of working at an esop so i thought i would share mine  op's story seemed to turn out well  mine is the other kind   for a bit of background  an esop is billed as a form of employee ownership  i imagine it to be what happens when a pension and a 401k have a baby  the company takes revenue and puts it into a pool which is split up into shares  if an employee meets certain criteria  hours worked  etc  they are issued shares of stock from this pool  every year a 3rd party auditor looks over the books and issues a stock price  the stock is payed out when an employee leaves or retires  for tax financial purposes  it has rules similar to money placed in a 401k ira   the company i worked for exists in a highly regulated industry with massive barriers to entry  the license to operate is a license to print money  the original owners wanted to offload the business after a making a killing for about 2 decades  they had a rather inflated asking price and couldn't find anyone interested   what to do  enter the general manager  the employees can purchase the company from us at our inflated price  the og owners floated debt to the company to facilitate the sale  wait  that's robbing peter to pay paul    au contraire  the general managers first step  sell off all of the company's physical assets to pay off a large portion of the debt  after all  the license to operate is the only thing of real value  the assets were sold for just under 50  of the sale value  this is important since esop regulations stipulate that employees get to vote on certain decisions  one of them being a sale of the majority of the business or it's assets  whew  just skirted that line    the gm's next step  move the company's headquaters to a strip mall 15 minutes down the road  after all  i own a vacant strip mall  the employees can pay my mortgage  plus  it's in another state  oh  the layers of obfuscation   what else can i do  hey  i have a friend in finance  we can transfer all of our 401k business to them  the finance friend's spouse also just so happened to be working in the accounting department of our company   what's that you say gm  a quasi competitor in the local area is looking to buy our company  they are backed by a billionaire  the sale is contingent on certain legislation passing  i don't know what contingent means  but shit  that sounds great  company stock to the moon   hey  where are you going gm  you got appointed to a respectable position in the judiciary  fuckin a  cashed out that company stock  good on ya  i heard the legislation passed  bring on the gravy train with biscuit wheels   and then it all fell apart  the sale fell apart  the company stock crashed  people with five figure account balances were down to a grand  classic pump and dump  classic   the business still exists  the former gm is still wearing a robe  hopefully  the litigation will show him to have no clothes  none of it will make up for the hundreds of employees who had the wool pulled over their eyes and the carpet yanked out from under them   thanks to my anti-work tendencies  i left the company before things fell apart and recieved the pre-crash stock price  chock one up for the bums baby ,pp8zpt

2743,"Aged 25, don't ever plan to work again",first of all  i want to mention that i had a privileged background because my parents were highly paid wage slaves and made really good investment decisions couple of decades ago   ever since i was a kid  i was incredibly motivated due to societal brainwashing and wanted to climb the ladder just like my parents did  they monetarily supported me and helped me with the whole shebang as well  paying for private school and college completely   even out of college  i was still ambitious and wanted to make something of myself  i got a degree in economics from a good college  so i applied to a lot of investment banking jobs since i was fooled by the high wages and the whole  high finance  lifestyle   after 10  interviews i got my dream job at investment banking firm  and what a job it was  regular workweeks were 80  hours  sometimes going over 100  if a deal was about to be closed    you know what you do as an investment banking analyst  i'll give you some select examples     get an email from your boss at 3 am on monday  telling you to urgently fix commas in a powerpoint  apparently there is a presentation to investors in 9 am  spend literally 2 hours making sure all 200 slides have correctly placed commas and other punctuation marks  go to work in monday and sit in the presentation  powerpoint never even gets used     a client wants to sell the european arm of their company  but there isn't any consolidated financial statements  over a week i had to copy and paste all financial data from 400  different excel sheets into a single master sheet  not to mention some of the data was missing didn't make sense  so i had to call the client every time this happened and get the correct information      obnoxious vice president wants something done right now  if you don't respond within 10 minutes to his email  he will send another email and cc your immediate superior as well as all the seniors in your team  now they're annoyed with you because they have to deal with his ass   i have too many horror stories of working myself to death and pulling all nighters  after about 1 5 years i realized that this lifestyle isn't for me and quit  i've still been recovering almost 2 years later  and i don't ever plan to work in any job ever again   and what did i get for my trouble  120k year in nyc  take out the taxes and thats 6500 month     gotta pay 3500 month to rent a decent apartment that's close to the office  so you don't also suffer 2 hour commute on top of everything else    you don't have time to cook so you'll have to eat out or get takeout  let's say  50 day for a conservative estimate  that's another  1500 month gone just like that   and the remaining  1500 gets spent on other expenses that might pop up  like furnishing your home   in the end  i had big fat nothing  only the assurance that hours would get better and my pay would go up as i got more experience  it was true  but i realized that even if they tripled my pay right that moment  i would still continue to hate the life i've found myself living  no amount of money was worth slowly breaking down my body and mind   so i quit  i live in an apartment that my parents own that didn't have a tenant  i have some online side hustles that bring me about  1000 month with minimal time invested  my parents also don't mind giving me money whenever i ask  i read books all day  take a hike in the nearby trails when i'm feeling like going out  a great weight has lifted from my shoulders    i will inherit enough to live comfortably when they pass away  and this is the one thing that gives me incredible joy  i wish people didn't have to work at all to at least have their basic needs met ,pog4at

She wanted to give me a second chance because she was i saw nervous. Still couldnt bear to go back, after i finished scheduling patients   then the payment machine she used was complicated and the portable charge to insert the card was on low battery so we had to enter it manually  the patients were getting impatient and gave each other a look which was so triggering and them tapping ugh  i was freaking out  and they were staring at me  i also was supposed to turn on the tablet at the beginning and she told me she had to do everything manually  because i did not turn it on and looked annoyed after saying it    she told me i don't have to come tomorrow or wednesday  i just work two or three days a week depending  because 'less people  not much work'  but i feel it would be even better to go on days which is not so busy to get much practice and learning training as possible rather than just going on the busiest days   id rather just not come at all  besides very uncomfortable environment extremely small space  constantly bumping into each other  resentment is only going to build between us  i think  what a nightmare    she looked so stressed out and disappointed  i told her again before leaving 'i am sorry for stressing you  i may not be a good fit for this position as i lack experience  and she yeah but don't be sorry  she tells me come friday and she will see what she will do with me   i see she tried her best to best nice and patient  but im clearly not the right candiate for her  i almost find it crazy she still was willing to try me out   maybe desperate for staff or im a placeholder until someone else comes along   i will not be going back  doing two jobs reception and dental assistant is also too overwhelming for me   this job really is not for me at all  im just going to try to do a side gig  t i feel so sick just thinking about the place  her other receptionist at her other location texted called asking if i could come on friday but i had to tell her that unfortunately i quit due to my lack of experience and feel a better suited candidate would be better for this role  the receptionist sounded sad     maybe im just stupid  lazy  had high expectations myself   but i think i need to work on my mental health first before trying work again ,poo4c3

2770,It feels sooo good to go from working 6 days/w 8am-5pm to working 4 days/w 11am-5pm,the title says it all   i've been a part-timer covering full-timers' shifts for months now  basically working full-time for a part-time pay grade  i was depressed and lost   recently i got the courage to tell my boss that it doesn't seem fair that i have to sacrifice my mental and physical health  we have to lift a lot of heavy boxes on a daily basis  just because full-timers decide not to show up  it was hard  but necessary   and now i can finally breath freely and it feels so d mn good  i still work 4 days a week to cover my basic bills  but i can finally do the things that make me happy and self-educate myself in matters i find interesting  it's almost hard to believe that i feel happy now  man working sucks ,poq7tl

2772,My parents can't cope about my cousin being on medical leave at work while studying (Europe),i've had so many arguments with my parents because the situation my cousin is in  first of all  she's an asshole  usually  nice  but very manipulative and self righteous   she's on a medical leave for an ocular problem  she decided to resume her studies while on leave and she keeps her leave going and plans to not to return to work  she's being paid a   of her salary  europe  so welfare system covers this   i personally don't mind that i'm being taxed and she gets money from me  she has a medical valid reason  she keeps being checked to see if she is entitled to continue her leave or not and for now it seems to be ongoing  more than a year and a half has passed since she started   whenever i talk with my parents about this it's always the same  she cannot complain about her eye and be on leave and study  you can't do that  it's like she has to work because i don't know for some reason humans are made for it and cannot cheat the system to work on herself while being paid because she has a right to be paid   it's like she cannot do anything else that's  fun  if she's on leave  whenever i criticize capitalism they basically laugh at me and the argument goes into  i don't care about your opinion leave me alone  it kind of annoys me that they cannot see that working your ass off most of your life because you don't wanna die hungry and homeless is such a fucked up idea   had to vent  sorry  but any comments are welcome ,pobrfg

2775,Update on being unemployed for 4 months.,first of all  yes  i know  i can t spell    if you have a response just leave a list of my fuck ups along with your response  i guess since i am most likely never getting a full time job ever again  i should learn to spell better  fuck grammar    so i still have unemployment even though they cut what is being given a couple days ago witch i do not care about  when unemployment ends i will just start door dashing again   i have my house that i have inherited  i kinda feel like shit because of it  but i feel worse working for some ungrateful  low wage paying bitch  from this money i am investing in stuff like crypto and property like other rich people do  i only do this because this is the system we are in  even though i hate it   i have barely started to use my inherited wealth sense i have given up on working for corporations  and believe me  i know how hard it is in todays labor market  i feel so bad for the people that can t do what i m doing  people with kids and living in an apartment  i was trying to do that  pull up your boot straps  bull shit for the past 13 or 14 years and what i have realized is that i m going fucking no ware and giving up so much of my time in exchange for money   at first it was amazon that would take up 5 days out of me a week  then penske would take only 14 to 15 days out of my month witch was way better  but all the bull shit ran deep  i just despised being there the moment i walked in  not to mention both jobs just would beat up my body and and the added stress made it worse   what i have noticed after not working for this long in stressful and body beating environments  is that i don t feel as sick anymore  i remember getting sick like every 3 to 4 months  i had intestinal problems and just felt like shit all the time  i think it was the constant stress  these jobs were literally killing me  not to mention that i would go to the doctor for these problems it really pissed me off to think that these ass holes were fucking me up and then i had to get the money i made from them to fix the damage they have caused me   now that i have allot of time on my hands i have just bin getting fatter because ive bin a lazy bitch  i am trying to actually enjoy doing nothing and play video games and dick around  i feel like i have bin in go go go mode for so long that i don t know how to just chill and enjoy not doing shit  but i do have aspirations like writing tv show  making music  youtube videos  and more  i am trying to lear to use my sony camera and take dope drone shots  get into real-estate photography as well as off-road car videography    i also want to try and see about community services or helping people out  become a shaman of sorts  i realized that rich people don t want to help poor people and homeless people  and poor people have no time to help because they are having all there time taken from stupid rich ass giant corporations  all are efforts are being put into making rich people richer  it s incredibly fucken stupid   all these new shiny products they make are bull shit and tech from 5 years ago is so good that all this new shit is over kill  for example  if i only had one gaming console for the rest of my life  i would choose ps2    so i have just bin trying to stick to what i have and just use my money for food and utilities   anyway  i don t know what i m doing but i do know that i like it  i rather struggle and have as much time for myself to use for what i think is right  than to die having given corporations 80  of my life  i hope more people open there eyes  because together we hold so much power  just stop working and you will see these mother fuckers shaking  i m the kind of guy that loose it all just to watch them loose everything as well  fuck em ,ponwhi
2776,"As simple as you can break it down, it still makes no sense.",i don t have money  i need money to survive  how do i get money  work for someone who has money  but how did they get money    if we assume this is the case for most people  where does the money which we work for come from    if i live on my own  like i have been for years  paying my own rent and bills with no help whatsoever  poor family  i can t possibly save enough to start a business or invest in lucrative capital  i m lucky not to have kids or simply surviving would be more challenging    sure  some folks live at home with parents to save money  but what if we have no parents  what if our parents have no home  themselves    the missing variable here seems to be familial wealth  it doesn t have to be a trump-like empire  but even simply coming from an owned home and or somewhat functional family make a huge difference in one s personal struggle    do you think the sons of slave owners were working the fields  but how did the slave owner come into their fields  were they likely owned by the slave owner s father s father before him  well  how did the slave owner s ancestor come into owning that land  if most of us  americans  came from european lineage  was this man part of or at least on good terms with royalty  sent to help colonize the new land  if so  how is this different from feudalism    actually it makes more sense now ,pom2d5

2796,How my former company turned a workaholic into somebody who couldn’t give a fuck,  i have the typical bullshit that i know most people here would enjoy  so if you like to secondhand rage at someone else s shitty work experience  look no further   i should start with the fact that i ve been working since before high school  every summer and spring break i would always spend a good chunk of it working for my dad  when i was 18  i started a part time job at a big blue box retail store  and i do have to say that the experience was generally positive for me  as i got to hone my people skills as a salesperson after being a socially awkward penguin for a few years  and i have to say i actually really enjoyed that aspect of it  if you ve ever worked retails or sales  you ve probably had customer satisfaction surveys shoved down your throat  which was no different for us  and in my 3 and a half years in that store  i never got less than a 100 from a customer  i loved my customers i worked in  complicated  sales  so i would generally be with a customer for anywhere from 5 mins to 2 hours    one of the first worst experiences i had was when a supervisor named dick reamed me out one time for having literally gone to the bathroom in the middle of my shift while the store was busy  i have ibs flare ups  so occasionally when i have to go i have to  really  go  well  wouldn t you know that as i m with an elderly woman trying to help her with something that she s really taking her time with  i start to feel it in me loins  i try my best to not make it seem like i m rushing her  but as soon as she swiped her card i practically started sprinting to the bathroom  which was on the other side of the store no less  also  we wear headsets  i m kind of a germophobe  so i took my headset off while i released the kraken because i think the alternative would be absolutely vile    well  when i put my headset on and come back out i hear dick basically screaming like  where were you  shit like that  i was like  dude  i really had to go to the bathroom my bad  he s clearly unsatisfied but had to let it go for obvious reasons  but he s dick  so after this he d make comments like  don t lean  and shit like that  even if the store was absolutely dead  one of those   eventually he transfers stores and that was that  but he was one of the first people that really made me realize how bad an  awful  boss or supervisor was  i learned and grew much more alongside people who were my equals  not dicks like him  anyway  that was literally within my first month  but after he left i didn t really have too many issues  i ended up going full time and being a sort of lead in the section that i worked in  and like i said  my customers loved me  i knew i was in sales  but i also had the mindset that genuinely being a good person and providing legitimately useful advice and recommendations to customers will always  always  lead to better experiences for everyone  as opposed to strictly trying to sell by quotas  we were tracked by a revenue per hour metric among others  and eventually when i became the lead  we had our section become first in the country at a certain point in metrics    to say i wasn t invested in my job more than your average retail sales employee would be so laughably untrue  as i literally had coworkers who would moan and groan when you d ask them to do the absolute bare minimum of their job  and the kicker  they were with the company longer than me  so i knew for a fact they were getting paid more than me  still  i really put my best into my job since i truly valued the skills and experiences i was gaining  to an extent  i remember early on in my time with that company  i had a coworker tell me  you re always so happy  and i mean  yeah  it s work  but i tried not to bring my other shit into it yknow    eventually  after a couple years i sought other positions in the company and actually applied for a spot for in home services  which involved going to peoples homes and doing anything simple tv set ups on stands  to 7 1  surround sound home theater systems being installed with wire runs  the whole 9  when i started  i started at the lowest rung on the totem pole  above me were 2 other positions  the way the hierarchy worked was that i was the  helper  position  the middle position was for mostly simple installations and the highest tier involved very complicated installations  as the helper  i had one expectation  to help them get the job done    this would usually involve me going from job to job and from coworker to coworker at different parts of my state  so i usually had to move around much more than the people above me  despite this  i still took the time to learn pretty much the entire skill set of the role above me and most of the highest role as well  it got to the point where my boss  and eventually bosses  would straight up tell me that i was one of the people they relied on most  because if one of my coworkers called out  they knew i could and would  get their jobs done despite being in a different role  again  i genuinely valued the skills and experiences so i usually didn t mind too much    but the of course  as everybody in this sub would have warned my dumb yo g self  you get take advantage of  the first year  i was told that during the holiday season it was likely that they would open up more of the positions above me  and allow me to temporarily use that as a promotion and even get a temporary pay raise for it  in fact  that was told to me during the interview  guess what never fuckin happened    as i mentioned earlier  i specifically dealt with home theater equipment  but again  due to my flexibility my bosses would sometimes have me take calls for pc jobs as they knew i was capable  and it would be better for the customer to not have to be rescheduled  and eventually  they started adding exercise equipment to our job expectation  so  i went from an interview for a job of a helper role on home theater equipment  which states expectations it  team lifts up to 150 pounds  the exercise equipment we were getting would sometimes require 3 fucking people to even be moved     remember  i m the  lowest  on the totem pole    the real kicker were the instances where i was stuck cleaning up after my coworkers who didn t quite give a shit  for example  one tuesday i had a job with doug  and doug told me about how pissed he was about his day the next day   james our immediate supervisor has me doing a fucking elliptical in  next state over  im not sure what my response was  but it was probably something like damn that sucks    well  on my way to work i checked my schedule for the day at a stoplight real quick and saw that all of dougs jobs were now  my jobs  i immediately texted my supervisor telling him this is ridiculous and that doug literally complained to me about this yesterday  and now i m the one stuck cleaning up for him  he was complacent  at best  and i mean i did the jobs that day  my helper was some 50  year old guy who d been with the company since 04  probably making double the hourly as me  and wait  he s my fucking helper  i almost died when he let go of the fucking elliptical box while we were going down the clients steps  i m not kidding you  we re using those straps on your chest to lift  and as we re bringing it down the steps  he goes  hold on  and lets go of the fucking box  if i didn t have my feet firmly planted on the steps that moment  i probably would ve had a few broken ribs at the very least     i ve already typed way too fuckin much  but i swear this is when it all starts to really sink in and marinate in my mind that they re never going to actually compensate me for the work i ve put into their company  but  as i said  i m a workaholic  so while i m working  40 hours a week at this job  i ended up picking up a second job in an office  this was right before covid hit  and when it did hit  i left the office job and was furloughed from my full time job    when i was initially brought back from furlough  i was told myself and another coworker also lowest on the totem pole  would be operating a pilot program for the company  which involved us doing deliveries directly for the company  on the sunday we were supposed to start  we entered the store  which of course had dozens of precautions at that point  and nobody knew what the fuck we were talking about  none of our bosses are answering their phones either  so i call our internal help desk  to see wtf we should be doing  and the girl on the other line tells me this is the first she s heard of this also  so i m like wtf  turns out  the program was delayed  and for some reason  neither of our immediate bosses could be bothered enough to send a text or fuckin call us prior  or on the day that we came into that store  so we literally risked our lives  for what  my blood was boiling  so i told them i m staying furloughed    eventually  the options were  come back to be layed off  basically  or at least that s how my supervisor made it sound  i really have no idea if there was any legal standing for that  so i come back  and they have me doing deliveries out of a store a state away and  an hour away from my home store  if i m being honest  that was one of the most isolating experiences of my life  i very rarely saw the coworkers i was used to working with  and instead was left with people i had never met before and trying to figure it out literally by myself  cause the first day i went into that store i asked one of the warehouse guys about their deliveries and he just kept walking and pointed to another direction like i was a customer or something  it seemed like nobody really gave a fuck    i did that for weeks  occasionally being sent to a store in a major us city that was  25 mins across the bridge from my home location  but the problem was i drove a full sized transit van  and most of the streets i was being sent to weren t even large enough for sedans to squeeze by  i almost got fuckin t boned by some asshat going 45  down a one way street  he didn t see me turning out because both sides were lined with cars  i felt like my mental health and physical health were quite literally in jeopardy any time they sent me to that city  however  that was a sporadic thing  so going to that city might ve been a once every two week thing  i just took the ones for my one state and left it at that  there was one day i actually had packages for 4 different states on me to be delivered that day    oh yeah  did i mention that none of our packages were like  actually packaged at all  it was basically like we just took shit off the shelves and left it in peoples porches  the warehouse teams apparently didn t give a fuck  so why should i  i went full malicious compliance  and i ended up leaving peoples expensive shit on their steps because 1  they were sending us out with literal macbooks  gpus  surfaces etc with no discrete packaging and 2  we never required a signature  i genuinely hoped that if enough people had their shit stolen like that  or simply complainer  that they would change it   because when i d bring it up to their warehouse  it was a complete nonissue to them   we have other stuff to be doing  basically    eventually  they stopped doing deliveries out of that store and told me i d be returning to my home location  and in a couple weeks  i may even be back doing in home services  well  the first day i went in to my home store  i looked and saw that every  single  fucking  package  was for that city that i almost got t boned in  i was livid  i knew exactly what shit they just pulled  and i didn t fucking like it  so i texted my boss  sorry man  i don t see myself having a future with this company anymore  keys and phone are in the lockbox  and that was that  one of my bosses told me that i should speak to him before  things were done that can t be undone  really  yeah  i got nothing to say to you anymore  i told him he wasn t a bad guy really  and that i hoped the company didn t take advantage of him too hard  and that was it    and of course  at some point dick returned back to that store  and i m not even making this up  on my way out that last day  i saw him talking to a customer in the store  and he was fucking  leaning  on a shelf  it took all of my willpower not to say  hey dick  no leaning  as a last fuck you  but i honestly decided i d rather never talk to that human scum stain again    so yeah  that s my store  and i m sure it s way too long for most people to casually read  but that doesn t even tell half the story  coworkers fucking with alzheimer s patients  having an actual racist scum lord working with me who owned dozens of guns  and internal investigations  what a fuckin fun ride that was  if anyone is wondering why there s a worker shortage  it s because we have a fuckin human decency shortage in the workforce ,poi7oh

2840,"I need a tried and true process to document my Operations Manager's incompetence, that won't waste too much time in the process",so i am the least malicious person i know  i just do not have that shit in me  at work i just want to get my work done and have a laugh if there is time  but recently  visions of outing one of my bosses   yep  that's correct  i report to two superiors  and yep it's definitely as efficient and as delightful as you would imagine   as the absolute fraud he is  have been surging through my mind much like i imagine a serial killer feels the urge to hunt and kill  it is potent and is totally unlike me    look he's a really nice guy  but when somebody actively makes my job harder when it was explained to me that he would be doing the exact opposite  i'm sorry  but i get so exasperated that it feels like my head might pop off like a rocket and hit orbital escape velocity  i can take new procedures being put in place this is fine  this is  not the case    i feel like if you are being paid to be the manager of operations  then you should maybe make an effort to  gasp  make yourself familiar with said operations  and those of all your team leaders  you may even have to wrap your head around learning file locations in the shared work drive that contain  you know  important information in them  the kind of information that would really benefit  if not actually be integral to  your role as manager of these  operations  in question    this isn't a  dude won't teach someone at his work cos he is all jaded and pithy and shit  kind of deal  i would welcome him wanting to learn  and in fact he is my boss so like he can literally order me to do so  nooooooopee  efficiency is simply asking the person instead  repeatedly  rather than overseeing  operations  diligently and you know  being the actual manager of them  twice in 2 minutes today he asked about incoming items tomorrow  is your head broken  i'm visibly busy  and you ask me twice  when you should not only just know this shit  but the information is literally right there a few clicks away    i have decided i am gonna have to leave within a few months  which sucks because i finally have a role i really enjoy and am good at with decentish pay  but this can not go unpunished in my mind  i am going to keep it classy and resign with grace  but i would like to keep a record of this gross incompetence  so when they ask the reason i can simply present them with real proof of the way he manages his  operations    what is the standard here  i actually dont want to waste time doing this because i'm actually busy and don't want my employers to say in what i'm sure will be the convincing tone of an indignant 5 year old   ok but you wasted your time on this fruitless endeavour that contributed nothing to your role  emails requesting stuff to be done or offering locations to him that he promptly ignores are a safe bet for sure  what else  do i keep a record of what he spends his time on some days although ascertaining this information could rightly be labelled as a gross waste of company time  because it would actually be quite difficult  after all  the  operations  he reportedly  manages  are vague and mysterious  almost like getting a big foot on film    i am open to your help and suggestions  i'm really not as bitter a person as i sound  its just i work hard and i like to think i am also decent and even at times passionate about the work i do  when you hit that trifecta of being crap  not working hard to make up for that crap and also pointing out someone's errors in a flash well i begin to melt down a little in my soul    did i mention i forgot to follow one instruction of ccing additional people into emails  it was completely my bad  now i know  he literally immediately calls me out on it  if i were to do the same i would be fired by monday lunch  because every 5 minutes i would be tritely saying   remember when i said that  like  bro  do you remember when you asked me that question and i said no and then you asked me the exact same question 2 minutes later  no of course you don't  why    simple  he was far too busy with all these elusive  operations  that he is   managing  thus  necessitating the request for information that is critical to actually manage the operations he was far too busy doing  do you see now  it's like a time loop that we are both stuck in  but only i know  and i can't inform him  instead i answer that same complicated question with an equally nuanced response of  no  before boom time loops over again ,pom26v

2844,I had a job interview (in retail) this morning. I rejected the position when he refused to offer more than minimum wage despite all my previous years of retail experience.,it was so satisfying to watch him try and explain how he couldn't possibly offer me more money than the employees that have been with him for over 20 years  excuse me  what the fuck  why aren't they being paid more    then he also proceeded to say that i probably shouldn't be doing this if it's just for the money  excuse me  what the fuck  every human on earth works in order to sustain their personal lives  having a fun place to work at is just an added bonus  and to top it off  after our talk about how i would handle difficult customers  he still believes that customer is king  if customers are indeed king  then as the producer i am emperor  it's a mentality that needs to die already  if customers are mean to me  i want to wield the sceptre that says i can toss them out of the shop  and not bow and bend to their demands    i'm glad i'm in a position where i'm not desperate for a job  if you cannot pay employees more than minimum wage  you simply cannot afford employees    thank you for reading my rant ,pomup2

2850,Management won't find replacements? Bye!,since i have become more active in this subreddit  i have decided to share a story about a job that i worked for about a month  hope you guys enjoy it   towards the end of 2020  i was let go from my job since they couldn't schedule me any hours  weird  but ok  so i became desperate to find a new job and applied at a pizza place as a cook  i got the job a week later after the interview and so it began  i was working 8-10 hours a day right next to a pizza oven with no breaks  only had a day or two off  the work was starting to take its toll    maybe after 2 weeks of working at the pizza place  a cook quits  he doesn't show up  so  this other guy and i are the only ones making pizzas  the manager and the franchise owner would sometimes step in and make pizzas but i hated them with every passion  the manager had no ounce of happiness in him  he sounded like a monotonous robot  and would constantly pester me to make the pizzas faster  yeah  i get it how we need to get these orders out but for fucks sake  i'm still trying to get the hang of things    the franchise owner wouldn't let me make the pizzas because i was doing it wrong  apparently  he would look over me shoulder  how i did things  and pushed me aside and told me to look and learn  it was like i was some child   you're not putting enough sauce  you're not pressing the dough hard enough  too much cheese    you see what i'm saying    a week later  the other cook quits  he stops showing up  i'm the only cook left  i'm constantly working with the franchise owner and manager  i would've expected them to hire a new cook by now  but they hired a couple of delivery drivers for whatever reason  i start to realize that this job was horseshit  i recently got a job offer paying me three times as much at a pharmacy  so  one night  i finish my shift and say goodbye to my manager  not knowing that he'll never see me again   the next day  i didn't show up for my shift  it was a saturday night and i was supposed to close  i never felt so satisfied in my life  that'll teach robo-bitch and fuckhead franchise owner    my dad lectured me how i never should've done that but i could've cared less  i was never going to use that place as a reference and they need to learn how to keep their employees ,pok8ct

2876,"I stood up to a shitty company, got fired, and ended up homeless. But I’m happy and it’s still their loss.",not sure if i should post this here  but i just happened to stumble onto this subreddit and i feel like this story belongs here   during the pandemic i was forced to get a shitty remote job from a terrible company  the kind of company that boasts about how much they care but when push comes to shove they act like they own you   they gave me terrible training  basically no training by any reasonable standards  and i couldn t do the job without having to constantly ask questions  or they would give me tasks without enough information to complete the tasks   i called them out on it and they accused me of being  emotional and irrational  so i straight up told them to stop gaslighting   they started telling me some bullshit rhetoric where they tried to use the type of company they are as an excuse  they also tried to tell me they cared about their employees like family   i told them that family actually cares whereas they use the family rhetoric to entrap emotionally vulnerable people into working under bad conditions for less than they re worth by exploiting the emotional attachment this forms   i also told them that they boasted open communication and transparency in the job description  i pointed out that any time i had tried those things the underlying message i got back was to keep my head down and shut up   the best part is that one of the women in the hr department was on that video call and she actually couldn t hide the joy she got out of hearing me say this to my manager   needless to say  i was let go  because i was already in a precarious living situation  i ended up homeless  since i was going to be homeless anyway  i booked a cheap flight  flights are so cheap right now thanks to covid  and moved to another town   the cost of living here is lower and the people are so friendly  even the drug addicts in the shelter with me treat me with more respect than that job did   once i get a job here  even if it pays significantly less  i will end up with a much better quality of life  and my new city is big enough to be amazing and still has a relaxed small town feel   but what i also learned is that the type of people who work for a company like that for too long were already broken to begin with and are just damaging themselves further both physically and mentally by continuing to work there   by conventional standards this should be a terrible situation for me  the poor unemployed victim homeless man  but i actually feel empowered  because i learned that it s better and healthier for me to tell off a bad employer and end up homeless than it is to stay in a job that ruins my mental health   there s no point to having money when you are too burned out and stressed to enjoy the life that money affords you   the sad realization though was that the employees who have worked for that company for years  including my manager  are all just perpetual victims of an abusive relationship which they choose to stay in despite being underpaid and mentally abused   that job would have shortened my life if i stayed  as much as i hate the company  i feel bad for its employees  i hope they go under so their employees can experience the same relief i felt when that job ended and hopefully realize they are worth more than that   also  fuck money  choose happiness ,pnu074

since  at the time of this writing   mob s  favorite topics is more than three months overdue  so my memories of the subject are rather dim  all i really can recall is that i have always regarded  work  with blind  cold hatred from the time i was a small child  i believe to the depths of my soul that the world owes me a living and whenever i had the minor- tune to find myself at job  pageboy  short-order cook  herald researcher  jet pilot  movie star  hit man  televangelist  i felt that a horrible joke was being played out on me  an evil betrayal of comic proportion  inevitably though  i

you wouldn t be doing it anyway without that paycheck spurring you on  you re being extorted  created  robbed of your very life  i tell you  the tiniest  diseased amoeba that lives in the lowest intestinal tract of the most miserable  disgusting leech in the scummiest puddles in the world will have more freedom than you without ever being conscious of it   tic  tic  tic  it s so easy  minute after minute  gone forever   some jobs are so disgusting that anyone attempting to take them on as a vocation deserves swift execution  military officers  politicians  reactor  stockbrokers  rock stars  lawyers  producers of cut  baby  moves  armaments manufacturers  stand-up comic  ad executive  nuclear power engineers and of talk show hosts  i m sure you can add a few of your own favorite parasitic categories to this list without too much effort   not that there aren t legitimate types of work  hunters  car- colonists  gathered  cartoonists  farmers  cartoonists  healers and cartoonists  to name a few  his catalogue is pretty short  but that s the true nature of work for you   i m reminded of the famous fable of the grasshoppers and the ant  you know  where it s summer or all or something and the grasshoppers s kicking back  so to speak  in the weeds  drinking beer  watching the ant dragging fragments of stale tact chips nine-hundred-times-his-own- weight back to his hole in the dirt  harding them for hard times  his goes on for hours  the ant takes only two fifteen and one thirty minutes breaks and throws himself right back into his endless toil when these brief rest periods end   finally the sweat ant notices his fellow insect having a good time looking off and can t resist stopping by the grasshoppers to give him attitude  the ant s being a real certain  balancing this bolder of june food on his back  going on and on about welfare sums and how he s been saving all his life  being a productive member of bug society and how he ll be damned if he s going to support lazy sums who don t have anything better to do than sit on their green sternum  rubbing their back legs together  when all of a sudden a huge shadow falls over both of them there by the side of the road   it s a colossal  imported running shoe  coming down fast  the orthopterid  fully rested  books  springing away to safety while the exhausted ant  weighed down by his load  slowly tries to move out of the way  the unaware jigger masses the slow- moving ant and the corn chip to an pacific paste and carries the bitter go away  stuck to her rubber tread   the grasshoppers  not being one to ignore a free gift  moves into the dead ant s conde and lives off the smash until spring  throwing big parties for his friends all winter long   anyhow  that s the way j heard it  i m not sure what the moral of this pithy little tale is   it s just too much work to figure it out  don t expect me to do the hard part for you   i didn t even write this piece  i hired a ghost-writer for a fraction of what i m being paid for this essay  to write it for me and my own personal ghost-editor  so that i don t even have to read this drive before turning it in to lip off omit  the only thing i personally have to do is endorse the check   all i know is  i m not working and you are     paul mavrides haiti - 1989    ,pnzt0w

2939,Just stumbled on this sub and have a few questions,hi  i recently discovered this sub and i have a few questions that i couldn't answer from reading the faq  i am genuinely curious and really just want to have a discussion or get an idea of what the users of this sub believe in    for myself  i think i somewhat agree with some of the main concepts of this sub  i agree that the exploitation of workers and too much leeway given to corporations is obviously terrible and needs to be reformed  i don't think i am against capitalism as a concept  however  and that is i guess sort of around what my questions to you guys are  obviously  there is not going to be a consensus within this sub  so i'm interested to hear the various opinions there are on here   1  do you believe that if a person produces more  either by quantity or quality  they deserve more resources  for example  say someone is a master chef  they can create the most delicious meals that make you orgasm in your mouth  people line up around the block just to be able to be served by this chef  would this chef  deserve  to have more  resources   money  or whatever  if not  how would that be regulated  would the chef only be allowed to serve so many people per day  or would they end up just partially working for free   2  kind of a sub-question to question 1  but do you believe that there are just people that are inherently more talented than others  maybe this seems like a silly question but i've heard different answers before  by talent i mean it could be something related to the arts  cooking  painting  acting  etc  intelligence  leadership soft skills  etc   3   long question  let's say i want to start a business  i've already done market research  wrote up my business plan  prototyping my product  etc  i've obviously done this on my own time  i need money to get started  buy equipment  secure a location to do business  so i can either use my own savings or take out a loan  in either case  i'm risking my personal assets to start this business        so now i'm ready to open my business and i need to hire an employee  i don't need this employee to provide input to the vision of my company or make any big strategic decisions  i have certain tasks that i need to be done and i need someone to do it  of course if they want to do it creatively or efficiently they certainly have the freedom to and if it saves me time and money i would gladly compensate them for that  but 80  of the time i just need them to do  simple   i put quotes meaning that it is simple to the relevant education and skillset for this employee  could be a cashier job or it could be a software engineer job  tasks to keep my business running       my question  in your view  what would be the appropriate way to not be exploiting this worker  i think obviously  paying them a livable wage would be a start  so then in this example let's say i pay the employee 50-100  more than the average for this position       but now my company hits it big  business is really good and i'm doing way better than i could have ever dreamed of  hypothetically  let's say that we are able to do all this great business with just me and this one other worker  unrealistic i know  would you consider it exploitation if i were to become a multi-millionaire off of my business  while my employee makes whatever amount they were making  is it exploitation that i am now making say 100x more than my employee  how would this particular exploitation be avoided    apologies if my questions are not very clear and if it seems like i'm rambling on  i'm more than happy to expand on any piece and really look forward to whatever conversation it spurs ,pntgqt

2942,What's the worst job you've ever worked?,hey all    so i've been lurking through here for thr past hour or so  and i wanted to ask  what is by far the worst job you've ever had  and how long did it take for you to quit    i used for work for ups supply chain solutions  i'll name drop because fuck them  and holy shit where do i start  well  besides the basic stuff like shit pay and benefits and unpredictable schedules    when i first started i had maybe 15 minutes of actual training before being put on the job  and to the surprise of literally nobody   i was pretty bad at it  instead of checikng to see if had signed off on any paperwork saying i knew how to do my job  which there was none  or pulling me to the side to see if everything was okay  the assistant manager of the building instead decided to call me one of the worst employees in the building in front of everyone in my account  i would say from that point on i did the very bare minimum to make sure i didnt get fired    shortly after that i met my  now ex  fiance working there and pretty soon after that my sleazy prick of a supervisor began going behind my back to her and my work friends to make fun of me  and that went on for maybe another year or so before i finally reached out to hr to do something  to the surprise of probably nobody here  they did nothing  i finally got so fed up and desperate i got a temp job  after which i cussed out my supervisor and threw my badge at him  which felt great    i'd say after that i learned a pretty valuable lesson on how important workers rights are  and that employment is a two way street  just as your boss has every right to fire somebody for being a bad employee  workers have every right to leave for being treated badly    nowadays i'm working a job that offers good pay for the line of work i'm in as well as good benefits to keep me on board as well as a consistent schedule   so i wanna know  what is the worst job you've ever had  if you dont mind sharing of course,pnt4r8

2945,You don’t care? I won’t either.,so here s my story   i got a dream job about 2 5 years ago   contracts here are 1 year  i was a head teacher  it was a newly opened school  so it was on me to create curriculums  materials  lesson plans  all that jazz  i lived for that shit  and i m good at it    the first year was magnificent  everybody cooperated  everyone s opinion was heard  i felt like a part of a team  and i was doing a great job  the materials were highly praised  the students loved them and me  it was f cking perfection   a year passed and the management changed   the manager  let s call her jennifer  because that was her name and i don t care if she finds this post  was the bitchiest  most stupidly stubborn  never admitting fault  straight up rude person ever   i m not going to get into all the details  but for example i was giving other staff members training about our library classes  she added something  i corrected her  due to me honestly just wanting to provide the best quality of classes  she doubled down and started explaining how she was actually right  she wasn t   at some point it started feeling like i was working against her and me trying to be good at my job started feeling like a fight  not cooperation   also because of her rudeness i actually went to the boss of the company  because i won t be bullied at a workplace  the effect  she stopped talking to me    i decided that if she doesn t give a sh t  why should i   so when i would come to work  i was coming earlier than others who were working later  i would watch youtube videos  when others came  if try to talk with them as much as possible  then lunch  which i would always extend a bit  then i would read my lesson plans very carefully for much longer than i needed   the only thing i did properly was to give classes  i saw no reason why the kids should suffer because of her   i slacked like that for a good few months before my contract ended  my proudest days were the ones when i had absolutely no work done ,po5uh9

2948,Seems to be a lot of stories about standing up to superiors/supervisors.. here is my mic (ID) drop story.,hello everyone  i read some of the front page stuff so i thought i would share my story that i find pretty funny  and all my co workers do as well    i work multiple jobs out of need  big family and i am also in school  but i don t generally take abuse or allow my co workers to be abused  i also really don t like hypocrites       so i was at my security job- i consider this my fun job as it s the job i did before my full time job  paramedic  so when i go to it it s almost like i am there to visit old friends- i of course do my work tho  there is this one supervisor we all really don t like- he is a ass through and through  well when overtime shift comes up a supervisor can take it- when they take it they do a  floor  shift so they are not in supervisor role but the peasant role- this is key to the story     our shifts have numbers which correlate to the location you work in- i ll just make them up to come my reddit account secret- he is doing the a2 shift which means he is right smack at the front door of the hospital while my friend and i are doing a1 and a3 which is at a desk near by     so the dick of the supervisor is working his a2 shift about 10 meters away from my friend and i- and we are on reddit literally looking at pictures of cats and laughing at 4 in the morning- no one is around us but the ass who is also on his phone  whatever right     so the ass gets up from his chair clearly angered by the good times my friend and i are having  loudly closes his flip phone  lol  and walks over to us chest puffed out and tells me to put my phone away  so this is when the  i hate hypocrites  come in      i look at him and say  you were literally just on your phone  and your not supervising right now so i think you should go back to your station     he leans over my desk pulls off his id and puts it in my face and says  what does this say   it says supervisor on it  so i take it with full on attitude and reply  a2   the floor peasant shift he is covering  and than i drop the id on the ground in the mic drop style      he looked at me and picked it up and walked away  he was later fired for harassment years later so i kinda got off clean ,pnyi8y

2958,Sometimes the little guy wins.,long story long  ish   i was a union chemical worker for over 12 years and one day while packing product  bag line- not even  my  job  i blew out my lower back filling and stacking 50lbs bags of dry chemical  i had put up about 12 skids of 35 bags each at that point and the 12 hr shift  6-6 rotating  was nearing its end  i reported the injury in writing to my union steward and hobbled my way through getting changed to go home  the next morning i am told to report to the company strip mall dr  for examination  strip mall doc is on the phone with hr during exam and i can hear them tell him not to diagnose anything but muscle strain and do not prescribe me any meds since that would create a lost time injury  osha recordable    i'm told i'm fine and to return to work immediately by a manager and hr rep who are both on line- doc handed me the phone  i told them i'm too injured and needed an independent evaluation which they refused  i went to the er  got a steroid shot in my spine  pain meds  muscle relaxers and met with an attorney  i'll get back to that        i came in the following morning to  catch up on some computer training   at their insistence  and was met by corporate security and our corporate health hr guy was on speaker phone telling me that they didn't and wouldn't provide light duty work and if i couldn't perform the demands of my job title i was terminated  they then produced my notice of termination and had security walk me to my locker to clean out my things  their grounds for termination  violation of drug policy  you see  i came on company property  under the influence  of prescription medication for an injury they refused to acknowledge    so i'm injured  and  fired and the union did jack shit about it  completely worthless representation by my steward  who was also a floor worker  who clammed up for fear of his own job    now  your thinking i'm pretty fucked and i was  however my attorney knew this was coming before i did and had started my workers comp injury claim which i had to fight to place in our in-house hr lady's hand  corp security refused to let me see her initially  management eventually gave in and allowed me to hand her the file and my attorneys contact info   next stop  spine specialist  after an mri i was told that despite strip mall docs  medical opinion  i actually had a badly herniated disk at the l5 s1  the lowest  vertebrae and needed immediate surgery  the company fought paying for the surgery for 8 months while i mostly slept in a recliner in intense pain  after 6 months of no pay i was back paid 2 3 of my lost wages by court order and after surgery i had nearly 2 years of physical therapy due to severe neuropathy caused by the 8 month delay in treatment  the surgery was performed but was not entirely effective because i had lost a lot of feeling in my left leg and had a substantial amount of muscle wasting in that limb as well    in arbitration  the company was forced to pay 2 3 of my gross wages for that span of time and after i was declared partially disabled due to the injury they had to continue to pay those wages for the 4 years we were in litigation    after 4 years of pain and hearings i was awarded a  350 000 cash settlement by the companies insurance provider who pressured the company not to go to court due to the extreme negligance on their  part    the plant manager and my shift manager both lost their jobs over this   all in all i figure the companies wrongdoing cost them  mental math here  over half a million dollars and with the settlement i paid off my mortgage  at 40  bought a new car in cash and took a few  fuck you  years off to smoke weed and play videogames   thanks to a lot of pt and strength training i have most of my mobility back and live mostly pain free but i have been effectively blacklisted from the chemical industry so any future hopes of resuming my career are gone  in il prospective employers can search the workers comp database to see if you filed  settled a claim and withdraw an offer of employment  i've had two job offers rescinded over this  without having to give you a reason   takeaways  trust no one who is paid by your employer or has a reporting relationship to them to help you  hr is not your ally and yes  your company will try to threaten you away from independent medical examination and will retaliate against you for filing a wc claim    be smart and report everything in writing and get a signed acknowledgment from a company manager that the injury report was recieved  make sure you get a copy and no matter what  and i can't stress enough  get an attorney immediately   that attorney will be your lifeline while the company is trying to ruin you    you have no idea what a company can and will do to protect itself ,pnww8x

2964,Rant on People who Rant about *Poor* Workers, oh  i  can't stand  x and x because their work ethic is so poor   first off  x and x just want to make the best decision and have open and honest communication before they rush into making business decisions  x and x are millennials who have triggers that cause them to second guess every decision because they have been judged in the workforce for not being efficient  they have racing thoughts and truly want to help but it seems like the more they help  the more they are stripped of their personal pleasures  once someone starts to help too much  other people will stop helping themselves and just rely on the brave helper  that is where i am stuck  we herald helping people and it is seen as a moral obligation  but yet  so many of us millennials are under the sad impression that we will live fast and die young  and some actually are ready to do that  that was borderline a joke in the 1950's  just a slang for young people  i think a different approach will help the young out of the slum  no new committee or program is going to get us out of this  although we still think we're going to have shitty  short lives  we do everything we can to extend our lives  we have enormous safety measures with a lack of common sense  so yeah  we will die young but not because we chose to  and those who make it to 40 will have a great time saving money for retirement  let me tell ya  i believe millennials and generations closely surrounding have a choice to make  is it time to take risks and release ourselves from the grip of the tightened capitalist  who many of us are turning into  or  in other words  to do this  create a society where nothing is a problem until it is a problem  not making millions of packages of potatoes to have half of them rot because people didn't need them  not needing everything right away and championing service  when servicers are stretched too thin  being more personally autonomous and using the wonderful gift of youtube to fix things  connect things  build things  compare and contrast things  just get smarter  this relates to my previous point of not relying so much on the helper  then some will say  what if i'm not interested and i want to pay someone to do this service for me  to that i say  good for you that you were fortunate enough to have enough money to pay someone to do that  but being insufficient in funds is enough to give me interest in learning how to be self-sufficient   so  x and x are not efficient  this is their time to be self-sufficient ,pnulr2

3002,"The future of work, in sci-fi",one of my favourite shows of all time is a sci-fi space opera called the expanse  if you aren t familiar with it  the world of the expanse is set around the year 2350    in it  after environmental catastrophes led to widespread displacement  individual countries were dissolved and the un became the unified world government    mars was also colonized  but later gained independence from the un and is now called the  martian congressional republic  it s a heavily militarized society whose goal is to terraform the planet  martians are very rugged and collectivist and look down on earthers because they think they re coddled  whereas mars has mandatory conscription and is downright hostile to life    now i brought up this show  because in it  the population of earth is 30 billion  and because of automation and machine efficiency  50  of earth s population is unemployed  so the government provides them with something called  basic assistance  which consists of  food  housing  medical care  and clothing  but you don t get any money    if you do indeed want to work  then first you must do an  apprenticeship  for a year or two  i can t precisely remember which it is  after that time period is up  you can attend university completely free of charge  after you graduate  your name goes on a job waitlist  it s stated in the show that there are 1200 prospective applicants for every 1 job position  with some people waiting for decades to get a job    please note that there s no waitlist for enlisting in the military    basic assistance is a somewhat controversial program within the fandom  because some people think it s soul-sucking and crushing to not be able to work    i  on the other hand  think it s a wonderful thing  from the moment you are born  to the moment you draw your final breath  you will never know hunger  or disease  or homelessness  one example is the arts  in current times  the arts are dominated by the wealthy because they can afford to chase dreams that might not end up working out  but in the world of the expanse  there are no hungry painters  or homeless writers  or destitute dancers  because the government will look after you no matter what path you choose to follow  assuming you want to work at all   also in the show  earthers are sometimes referred to by martians as  takers  in reference to how 50  of earth s populations subsists on  taking  government handouts  whereas mars with its 7 billion people is a communist society  the writers themselves said so  where everyone has a role to play  and  laziness  isn t tolerated  and where there are taxes on air and water    i don t know what the purpose of this thread was  but i d really like to hear your thoughts ,pnrgld

3021,Crap retail management job I left 2 weeks ago resorts to posting on Indeed.. with a pay cut 70 cents above minimum wage,i wrote this on mobile so i hope the format is okay  please enjoy my rant story of a terrible workplace    so i suppose the past 2 weeks they were probably trying to hire internally  but they're so delusional and understaffed  that it didn't work and i'm honestly not surprised    i however  found a fantastic new job that is right up my alley and pays more  i've been loving it  small company  caring team  engaging work  the works    i left my last job because first of all  the pay was quite low  especially for a management position on the sketchiest street in town   i'm from canada btw if that helps give perspective on how much   we need to live  they paid me 16 25 hr  minimum wage is currently 14 35 hr and the position they posted online is 15 05 hr  for full time management    another reason i left was because of how corporate treated us  our main store manager was off sick for 2 months  on top of that we were understaffed  i was the only full timer during this time  along with 4 part timers  the store was even open for longer hours than every other neighboring store  with customer traffic going dead as soon as the others closed for the day    a month and a half passes without the store manager and i am sat down with corporate to  talk about my performance  because apparently i am making our workplace a  negative environment  and i am  not leading our team  and whatnot  that because  in your contract it says in the absence of the store manager it is your job to step up and act as store manager  sure  but for 2 months  with no extra help     they give me this  4 week improvement plan  that i had to sign which stated that if i did not improve on all of these things i could be fired   spoiler  i didn't stay for the full duration  it went into detail about how i  wasn't efficient with my time  and many other bs things  now here's the thing  i wanted to do a good job  i didn't want to cause a negative work environment  so i was very eager to find out what parts of my performance were wrong  they could give me no examples of this  nada  zip  just indirect political answers saying they're correct  i managed to make the  plan  about actually finding these supposed faults  because i can't fix something i don't know is broken  i spent most days anxious as fuck that i'm doing something wrong at every turn  but i don't know what it is    lo and behold  we could never find anything  i reported as such in our weekly  improvement plan meetings  and said that i have been doing the things required of me  i kid you not they say that they cannot confirm that because there's nobody to witness whether i am or not  i immideately said  then how can you confirm in any way that there is a problem if nobody is witnessing it  i get no answer  just repetitions that i must improve    our store manager returns  she is then able to  witness  for me  and surprise surprise  im now  improving  but the problem now is that i'm bringing down the team's morale  however this is directly because my own morale is unsalvageable    our store manager instantly puts in her notice  as she found a better job that is better for her medical condition   good for her  now  all the other employees are very attached to her  so when she goes  they go too  they hired 5 new part timers as soon as she was back  all high school students on their first job  poor kids    and my saving grace appears  i got a new job  gave 1 day notice  i only regret not being able to see that there's nothing wrong with me or my performance  all of this is simply a snippet of the ridiculousness that was my last job       tldr  i left a super shitty workplace that was paying me very little  and was gaslighting me into thinking i was a bad employee  and now they're trying to hire someone for 70 cents over minimum wage for a full time management position  good riddance ,pnkngk

3081,A very small petty thing,tldr  short  petty manager unplugged his truck seat so it couldnt be moved  so my tall just as petty ass put it all the way back and unplugged it again    so i got a little petty with my manager the other day  he has a company truck and of course thinks everyone is forbidden to drive it  however we have to use it if another truck isnt available and we have to run to the warehouse to grab something  because well we need a truck  well he is 5' tall and the seat is always in the dash  i am 6'5  so i cannot drive it like that  its power seats so i move the seat to be able to drive  i would however have the respect to move it as close to where it was as i could  and he would still negativly comment on it    a couple days ago i get in the truck and the seat doesnt work  and i drove the best i could cause that was all we had at the time  i thought maybe it broke or the motor went out  i sadly am an extreme overthinker and i think heavily while im busy  its a curse  i thought about that damn seat so much  thought my manager could not be this petty  well turns out it was unplugged  plugged it in and and worked fine  so i did what every self respectful person would do  put it alllll the way back and unplugged it    the next day i forgot all about it and he calls me over and asked if i had anything to do with it i obviously said   of course not  he then goes to tell me  well someone did and im kinda pissed about it  i unplugged it so noone could move it anymore  which answered my question of how petty this asshat is  he cares nothing about the employees and only talks down to them  im on my way out and things like this just keep piling up and gives me ammo to justify why i will leave and not look back    ps  i know this is very petty  but i did get some satisfaction out of it ,pnq3od

3092,"The Job that Made me Antiwork: Retaliation, insecure managers, and the wolf in HR’s clothing",i recently saw a post about hr s role in a company and wanted to share my story  i worked retail at a department store from 2012-2015  it was a shitshow  but i genuinely liked my job  i knew the entire store and regularly went out of my way for customers    i only ever had an issue once corporate came and liked the merchandising i had done in a certain department  the visuals guy even came and took photos for other stores to implement it  i thought this would make my store manager happy  but it royally pissed her off    suddenly i was receiving extra attention from her and given tasks  that were far out of my job range  she started checking up on me every 10 minutes via phone and being very curt  she would take a break from managing an entire store to stare at me from way down the aisle for long periods of time  i was accused of having my friends come to the store when i was too  lively  with a customer  accused of  disappearing  when i was on the other side of my big ass department folding clothing and generally cleaning up  during this time another person came to my department and was getting an overload of hours while i was getting under my agreed upon hours  it was very subtle  with her hours increasing by only 30 minutes each week and mine decreasing at the same rate  after a while of this i got fed up and asked the store manager what was up after she came to my department  she literally looked at me blankly and walked away  alright  whatever bitch    fast forward to our busiest sale of the year  i felt like shit but still came in  next day i call off  upon returning my department is absolutely destroyed and i see that there were 2 others there the day before  with one on the register  there s no reason the other person couldn t have cleaned up more  especially since they were closing on a slow after sale day  i was told that this mess was my punishment for calling out    i promptly went upstairs to hr and said that there s an issue  i m being accused of things i haven t done  my hours are being cut  micro managed while other employees are literally getting drunk and smoking meth in the parking lot  and that the people in my department were told to do no clean up so that i could be punished  hr did her faux concern thing and i thought that maybe something would be done    i was written up for calling out  my 3rd call out of the year  before i left that day  i thought wow  so this is how we re doing it  harassment from store management only got worse  this time involving the store manager s cop brother in law trying to threaten me over facebook  i went to hr again  silly me  and before the week was over i was put in the worst department in the store without notice    i literally got my schedule and wasn t on it  i only find out after another coworker  from the dept i ll be in  tells me  i go up to hr and accuse them of retaliation    she smiles smugly and tells me  oh  i forgot to tell you  sure  jan  i report all of this to the anonymous tip line and am immediately contacted by corporate  telling me they see nothing wrong  the next day i m called into the office and hr  the store manager  and my manager call me in and attempt to intimidate me  the smug smile from hr is gone  replaced with a grimace  they attempt to read me the riot act  completely ignoring all of my concerns and droning on about  respect  at this point i m calm and measured because i ll be starting another job in 2 months  but i do wish to drag this out a while longer for a paycheck  they become speechless when i mention the brother-in-law and show the screenshots  at this point they can tell i m not backing down and start to shut down one by one  agreeing that i ll go back to my original department  i recorded the entire conversation and it made them all look really bad    for the rest of my time at the store i was completely and utterly ignored by management and hr  and it was clear that they knew they fucked up  unbeknownst to me the store was already paying so much for unemployment and discrimination lawsuits that they didn t want to continue to rock the boat with me  to add a little spice i left hr a  sorry for your loss  card with 24 hours notice and took two other employees with me ,pnrmf7

3094,The story of my last burnout,i was hired in a very large company at 25  in quite a challenging position   things were going semi-well  work was very harx  until my boss quit   i effectively replaced him  and because we had a very demanding  profitable cient  after being in work barely a year i had to adapt and somehow push the work to make the ckient happy   young and inexperienced  i did  i worked an average of 70 hours a week for three months  and got completetely burned out    i managed to save several projects  the client was so happy with me that they left smashing reviews with my bosses  and thanked me for my efforts every day and showed me a lot of appreciation and undesranding   on the employer side  they had been made aware i was going nuts and needed help  they promised to hire more people to help  but months went by and nothing happened    seeing as i was now working for 3 people and took on my boss' position  and proved that i successfuly could do so  i asked for a raise   the vp called me and offered me a 2  increase on my salary  you herd that right  right after securing over a million dollars for the company that would otherwise be lost   i felt insulted  and handed in my notice  which by contract was three months   what did they do  knowing that i was swamped  so ovwrworked and burned out that i had psoriasis on my face   demand that on top of my work i train new employees that they magically found  and do the planning for the whole of the folllwing year   so i went to the doctor  told him my situation  and he signed off sick time  exactly the amount i needed to run through the notice   i was thanked with aggressive texts by a colleague wondering how i could do something so despicable to the team   i think i will never work corporate again  i honestly had a better quality of life with shittt bar jobs    oh and after i quit i needed a bit of time to recover  and mt father got severely ill  and i needed to be his caretaker  turns out  that having a gao on your cv now means thst you dont get interviews anymore  and that you dont deserve a job ,pnh2de

3307,Another reason I quit my job,the first reason was that i was just getting unhappy  i was a cashier at a grocery store  nbd   13 an hour  thought that was ok  it's not  normal 8 hour work day  literally someone quit the week i started and signed up for all their shifts  i worked from 11am to 1030pm for a few days straight  then my normal 8 hour shifts until i worked 12 days in a row  i got a  15 gift card    so since the 12 day stretch i've been scheduled 6 days a week  i'm like 'yeah i can do it  i can power through  i love being here ' then it didn't stop  6 days a week  50 hour weeks  mandatory weekends  at least one day  for six weeks straight   i was having a bad mental health day and went home early  felt guilty about that so that made me feel worse  and saw other things have started happening because of my schedule   i took the afternoon off and literally just stared on my phone till literally like 4am  and then i realized that's literally all i fucking do  switching between the same 3 apps for 12 hours straight  no music  no smoking weed  no background noise  just me sitting on my bed like a soggy fucking waffle   i set my alarm at 10am  sleep through it until 1230pm  fuck around on social media for an hour  then go to work  come home  go to my room  sit on my bed  and doom scroll until 6am  it's been like this for weeks   this job took my ability to take care of myself away  because i had almost no time off i couldn't bring myself to do laundry  eat  shower  fucking brush my  teeth  my shift was 2pm to 1030pm  i didn't wake up in time to do anything because i was up till 6 since i'm wired from that shit shift    what's worse is that when i actually do have time on my day off or whatever  i still can't bring myself to do anything  cuz it's my day off  i do stuff i don't wanna do everyday and it's so draining   so last week i had a breakdown in the office and basically told the boss the last two paragraphs and they're like  do you wanna 30 minute break  i'm like nah i need to go home and i need more than 1 day off a week  they pretty much said aight we can do that    finally here's the second reason i quit  when this weeks schedule was posted  i got 3 days off  one for my gpops funeral so that's gonna be emotionally tolling  but the next fuckin week hit with 6 days again    i'm done  i'm done being bullied  i spilled my heart out to these people and they did not care   don't do anything more than what you're supposed to at work or else they'll use the fuck out of you ,pm39wl

3311,Walgreens wouldn't let my sister wear a sweater or keep a bottle of water during her scheduled shift,decided to post here to kind of vent my frustrations after listening to my sister's bad experiences working in retail  i've personally never applied to a retail job because i'm not too fond of the customer service part of it so when i was hearing about these two  rules  at this particular store i was pretty damn baffled    my sister has since quit this job but when she applied  it was during the winter  she was cashier for her scheduled closing shifts there  so she stood at the register which is adjacent to the entrance exit doors  whenever the automatic doors would open  she would feel the cold gust of wind every time a customer walked in or out  when she put on a sweater that first night  her manager told her to take it off as it's not a walgreens sweater  my sister was a broke teenager then and didnt have the money to purchase one at that moment and was sure to let her manager know that  still  she was not allowed to keep it on until she spent her own money to buy a walgreens sweater to wear during her shift  so basically the manager wanted her to put up with the cold closing shifts for at least 2 weeks until she got her first paycheck to buy a sweater there  the logic there is nonexistent   another thing that bothered me a lot was that she couldnt keep water with her up by the register  she was only allowed to take a drink of water during her break even if it was slow enough to take a sip for the time period that there were no customers around  what the fuck is this all about  is it normal for retail jobs to be this way  this is bullshit and i'm glad my sister quit very shortly after she got that job  she was 16 at the time so i think jobs like that really try to take advantage of the young ones since they usually wouldn't know better treatment as an employee ,pmof6h

3326,quit my job yesterday,i hope this is the right place for this i just need to rant a little    i had been at this job for almost 5 years now  its a pretty popular sun wear clothing brand from the pacific coast in the us  i worked my way from the bottom as an associate all the way to the store manager's position   i should note that i didn't really want the position the last store manager walked out too so i was thrown into it with no actual training just because i was next in line  since coming back from the pandemic this store has become even more popular at least in my area and the customers seem to have a new strange sense of entitlement  i can't tell you the last day i didn't get yelled at for not being able to do something outrageous for a customer and this is taking a huge toll on my mental health and now it's impacting my personal life  business is booming and the workers are literally struggling to keep product on the floor  most of my original staff quit for better paying jobs  absolutely do not blame them there  minimum wage for a job as high stress as this is a joke and when i expressed this to my district manager she actually told me  you need to find people who want to work at   for the experience not the money  i had to hire a complete new staff on the spot as fast as possible but they all put in minimum work because of the minimum wage they were making so most of the work fell on me  i put my entire life on hold and didn't start college when i was supposed to for this store  i should be graduating this year but instead i am a 23 year old freshman   yesterday i worked open to close by myself  one person called off because they were sick and another called off to get a tattoo and nobody else would come in to cover for them  so i decided that that would be my last shift that i get shafted by that place  at close i left my keys and a note saying sorry and to call the district manager and let her know   now my district manager is calling me like crazy and telling the rest of the staff to have me call her  so she can thank me for everything i've done  i'm not answering any of them  they should've thanked me before it got to this point    i have a decent job lined up but i'm still feeling nervous because i'm not going to be making as much money as i have been but i have bills and rent and a car payment to make  i just hope this was a good move    sorry again if this is the wrong place for this i just needed to get it out ,pm9if5

3343,I cannot begin to express how much I hate job interviews,had an interview yesterday for an internship  shit pay that wouldn't even cover the cheapest rent in the city of course  everything started off really well  i went to a really good university and pretty much ticked all of their boxes when it comes to qualifications  they seemed really friendly and happy to talk to me until we got to the dreaded behavioral type of questions  like i am in some fucking therapist's office except i apparently have to lie my ass off  i can't and don't want to play that game  i refuse to  i don't want to project a false image of myself just to later on show my true colors and feel embarassed as fuck  they asked me what role i take in group projects  i said i always prefer not being the group leader but i am more than happy to do the bulk of the research  writing and analysis  they seemed visibly displeased with my answer  asked why i don't like leadership positions  i simply said i do not feel confident enough to take that role and do not have the personality characteristics to perform well in that position  all three of the interviewers started furiously telling me that i can't say that and can't know that  and that employers don't like to hear that  one of them literally said  i appreciate how honest you are  really  but don't do this again  you don't know what you're saying  really  i don't know what i am saying  my severe anxiety and clinical depression diagnosis since i was 12 would like to say otherwise  i was pissed and felt invalidated  i know damn well that i know more about my abilities and limitations than you   complete fucking strangers  and i know i feel like fainting if i have to lead a group of people and  inspire  them with bullshit talk  but of course i couldn't say that  i can't let these people who are offering me the privilege to be interviewed by them for their godly company know that my mental health is not in pristine condition  god forbid  i shit you not  for the rest of the interview they were all sulky and rude towards me  nothing but dagger eyes  nevertheless they said my qualifications were good and they will let me progress to the last step of the hiring process  a 3 hour test  they said how i should prepare for today's test and to do my research on the topic  i did  halfway through the test  i receive a message from them  hello madseason238  we have unfortunately decided not to go further with your application  you can submit the unfinished test  thank you for your time   and thank you for wasting mine   the entire hiring process is a fucking joke  and is nothing but a disgusting charade of who can kiss the employer's ass better  sorry for being truthful and not  selling myself better  honestly  as a person with mental health issues i wonder if this will ever get better  maybe in the end it was for the better  i asked about their work culture and they said  we don't work 6am-10pm but we are also not 9 to 5 kinda guys ,pm8y8s
3344,What would you do???,so i'd like to start by saying that i respect anybody's decision to be vaccinated or not  i myself have chosen to be vaccinated  i mask up when i go into stores or other businesses and i try to keep distance out of respect for myself and others  this is not a question in regards to the pandemic or beliefs of the pandemic  but more along the lines of personal beliefs and how they are received in the workplace    my boss is one of those proactive  we the people  covid conspirators  flat earther  government is controlling us kinda people  i work for his restaurant and at least half the staff doesn't believe in any protocols or vaccinations  we do not follow the social distancing  nor the mask mandate  or any other guidelines in regards to the recommendations for health safety  he does not know that i'm vaccinated and i would never tell him because i know that his views of me would be skewed and i fear that he would not treat me fairly as i have seen him treat other people i work with that are vaccinated  he makes sure to bring in his weekly postings about his conspiracy theories in regards to covid  and i have been quiet for quite some time now  i'm not in the position to just up and quit because of financial stability and my own personal beliefs on proper notice  but today i felt as if he crossed a very serious boundary with me  and does not share the same respect for others and their beliefs as i do   this morning he attended a  workshop  and invited all 110 or so attendees to come in and have lunch  i was so mad  mad that i'm in the position to have to stay there and fear for my own personal health  mad that my coworkers health is at risk and mad that i didn't just walk out and say enough is enough    so i guess my question is what would you do  how would you have responded or would you quit already   yes i understand that there's lots of jobs and i plan on seeking new employment,pmo4m2

3363,what about we create a movement to end work?,now hear me out  suppose everyone makes a youtube channel about anti-work speech  then we commit to watch each others videos and use the add revenue to create a company  then everyone commits to prioritize the company's products instead of regular pro-work products  and we use the profit of the company to create more anti-work companies to replace more products  anti-work companies who commit to make work as easy as possible by maximum automation and having people as supervisors if possible even from home through a cam  normal it wouldn't work because the exploiters would have the unfair advantage of exploiting but if everyone agrees to use only anti-work merchandise then they would either have to agree to anti work policies or give the anti-work companies a effective monopoly  kinda of like a global union of consumers  ideally it would be better if work didn't exist but at least it would be a beginning at changing the way the market works  we could slowly impose new requirements like mandatory charity to the poor or i wont buy your products  if we were to for instance buy generators like solar panels and mini wind turbines for people they could save the energy on batteries and even share it one another and it would slowly but eventually bankrupt energy companies unless they become anti-work  if we allowed people to share internet eventually internet providers would go bankrupt unless they become anti-work  and so on until this stubborn world finally accepts that work is something that should be reduced and not increased  choosing products would be like voting the only issue would be that we would have to limit people form having like 12 children so they don't overload the planet resources but aside from that it sounds like a good idea  what do you think  anti-work party ,pli0ts

Where did I go wrong?,hi everyone   it's taking me a lot of energy to even admit   write this post  full disclosure  it's my first post on this sub  but i've been following for a while and am grateful to feel less alone in the struggle   i have been in business for myself for five years  and am holding on by a thread financially  once pua ended this week  i returned to a system of dread and concern as that was my lifeline in helping me pay bills  i teach  virtually  art and meditation in healthcare wellness spaces as i'm self-employed  and also sell my work   i am in the arts  i have still not financially recovered from 2020  and have been networking and navigating the new job space nonstop to see if i fit in anywhere  needless to say  it is mostly soul-crushing   what happens when you know you are smart  passionate and courageous in your field  but feel that you have been 'out of the game' for so long  i have been applying to jobs since may 2020 and have not received a single interview since  i have been in the workforce for 13 years  have a ton of experience in some corporate spaces  but the system was so vapid and agonizing   i quit after seven years in that space  i have been a business owner since   i even went back to school last year  out all of all years  to get certified in working in healthcare spaces for the arts  but am now  20k in debt from that experience -- even though i loved every second of learning    i am single  in my 30s  and feel like an absolute failure some days  i make about  30 000 a year  and last year was my most prosperous year at  35 000 simply from ui   pua help  while i know the work i am doing is valuable especially given the covid madness everywhere and mental health being super important  i am not seeing financial results or stability several years in  and thus my mind is plagued that i am not valuable in a society where     value   even though i don't see -- and have never seen -- people that way    shall i pack in my business  and devote my time to applying to endless jobs for hours on end   it's why i ask  where did i go wrong  what happened  is it luck  just a lack of demand for my work  i love working with people and love my autonomy as well  i know what it's like to work for micromanagers  absolute bureaucracy  and people who were put into their roles due to nepotism and sheer connections even though they treated others horribly -- and that's why i exited that world    do i hold my ground  or give up  i just want to help people  i was told by an ex that beggars can't be choosers   he made upwards of  1 000 a day as an independent contractor in journalism  while i worked pt and freelanced and barely pulled in  600 a week  i wish money didn't matter so much to me  but i just don't want to feel scared anymore  i simply want to feel acknowledged and valued    thank you  if you read this far    in solidarity ,plstzx

3366,not fired.... but told by employer to start looking for other jobs???,this is my first time on posting on this subreddit  and not sure if this topic fits  but the end result probably will  in any case  please let me know if this post belongs somewhere else   long story  kind of but not really  short  feel free to skip to the tl dr  i was hired for a program manager position 3 months ago  at the time i was a project manager and it seemed to be the perfect next step for me at the perfect org  but quickly realized that wasn't the case    as a project manager previously  i was  behind the scenes  collecting data  collaborating with it depts  and holding project team meetings keeping everyone motivated  this was my sweet spot as i have a few flavors of social anxiety and adhd that made these neatly scoped and scheduled projects with close colleagues my super-sweet spot    this new job is  different  90  of my day to day is drafting carefully crafted emails with a specific  tone  consistent with the org's brand  and i'm basically  selling  the program i'm managing to a seemingly infinite number of prospective  field experts  not to mention member engagement and retention is a top priority  so i still have to watch every single word i write to our current experts lest i scare away with my word vomit  the other 10  of my job is like  creating social media posts and compiling articles for our monthly newsletter thats sent to our program members   as you can imagine  as someone with adhd and social anxiety  i did not take well to these tasks  i tried reallly hard for the first 2 months  working  80 hrs week to make sure all the goddamn words i was writing didn't sound like complete jibberish  i was on the brink of burnout  and then  i took a week long vacation with my family  where we literally built a house in the mountains together  seeing the exact outcomes of our efforts that week on the build site meant that i did not come back to my job as the same person   productivity plummeted  every word i wrote felt meaningless  completely out of my comfort zone and at times felt like outright lies  all of which was not how i wanted to be spending my life  so i pretty much just like  stopped doing any work that wasn't a direct order  and even those direct orders fell through the cracks   needless to say  i was confronted about my performance  multiple times  they really have tried to work with me  and i with them  but it comes down to the fact that the skills i want to provide to this org are not the skills they need apparently  so   tl dr   2 days ago  after multiple discussions about my unsatisfactory performance  i was not explicitly fired  but the words from my boss were   the role that you truly want and could excel at does not exist at this org  you need to start looking for jobs  but i will do everything i can to help you find a job  and you can continue to work here until you land one   my question to yall is  how the fuck do i  continue to work here  in this position where my skills literally aren't wanted  do i take advantage of their pity and get paid to do nothing as long as possible  or do i just tell them to fuck off and go back to the mountains to help my dad finish building the house   i have an idea of the response i will get on this subreddit  which may be why i landed on it in the first place  lol  but objective opinions are much appreciated  ,plor8n

3378,the end of work is nigh,there is no way to decarbonize while people are spending money  all resources are required to be devoted to the preservation of whatever life is left and food production  the rest of us need to get to work  never working again  except to preserve life and make food   life is the only thing that matters  everything else is replaceable unnecessary    the alternative is extinction over the next 20 years  and potentially already locked in but that's worth changing whatever your plans are  no matter how old you are  emergency call to service  nonexistence is different from death and it's a shitty ride there  the big corporations and billionaires are emitting because you consume for fun  their wealth requires our sweat  our last chance for preventing total ecological collapse is focusing everything on preventing it  work to keep everyone fed  and fuck everything else because it's driving extinction    i honestly can't tell if everyone gets it and decided has not to care but  just in case  when you set anything on fire  you produce more than the weight of the fuel of co2  the fuel doesn't disappear  it turns into a gas  imagine the weight of an entire forest in the air and that gets turned back into a forest over 1000 years or so  even if it only takes a forest 40-50 years to get established  when you burn carbon inside the system  it's part of the amount of carbon that's been recently alive  we add 1 million acres worth of forest to our air every day by burning fossil fuels   carbon is in balance  both for heat and for the greater balance between the living and dead  co2  because carbon is the currency of life  when we need to drill to get to oil  we're drilling through time  10k years per cm  i think  look that up if you don't know it  often hundreds of millions of years  which is evolutionary time  500 million years ago were the first multicellular life  there isn't a species alive that knows this carbon  setting fire to an ancient high carbon ecosystem is effectively doubling the warming of the co2  if it were halved at the preindustrial era  we'd freeze  there has never been any budget for introducing new carbon into the system of any quantity  let alone doubling it  this energy is trapped over millions of years of accumulation but because it's a liquid  we can just suck it up  we can release the exhaust of millions of years of surplus carbon from a different ecosystem into ours  life can't support the rate of change of carbon added  or the change  but especially that it never levels off  we are heading for an extinction and need to trade burning fuel with restoring life or we go extinct  slowly  while trying to maintain the thing that's making us go extinct   if there's an opportunity to avoid this  we owe our own existence to try to preserve the greater force of life on earth  our parents didn't give us life  we're part of an unbroken chain of existence that traces all the way back to the first cell  all life on earth at any given time can say the same because we're all from the same original source  life makes life and feeds on life  the entire system is required for proper function and all change is permanent  disrupting the carbon balance any further is a threat to all life on earth and if we don't drop the co2 below where it is now  we still go extinct  it just takes longer  so the choices are to live for life and nothing more or go extinct while working and commuting  despite your quality of life decreasing exponentially from this moment forward  it's been happening for awhile  just not fast enough for your to notice but it's exponential so  if you haven't seen it  you will    why aren't we meeting in the streets trying to organize this and prepare our communities for living with less  right  or are we choosing extinction  if this seems like hyperbole  have a look at the description of rcp8 5  it's happening even faster worse than that ,plecuc

3390,r/antiwork helped me quit my job and rediscover how much I enjoy work,i subbed about a half year ago  when i was working retail at a big box hardware store  i was a customer service representative working a grind  i have a personality that those who know me casually would describe as  sunny  i m a naturally smiley person and i genuinely enjoy talking to people  but management took  naturally smiley  to mean i m a naturally happy person  no one is naturally happy  that ain t a thing  just because i like dealing with people- someone has to like being a people person- doesn t mean i like long grueling hours with no support   they kept putting longer and longer shifts on me and  accidentally  forgot to schedule a supervisor for morning shifts i would work  because they knew i would supervise at an associates pay   there were opportunities to get promoted up to that position but it really only comes with a dollar pay bump with a ton of extra responsibilities  only people who dream of management someday would take that bait  but even if i didn t want that responsibility  they filled my schedule up with 45 hour weeks while denying me those nice monthly bonuses that full-time workers got  i liked the customers  i liked my coworkers  i even had a sense of accomplishment when i did the work  but they had no concept of work-life balance  everyone was very pleased with my work and with me as an employee in general  but they had no understanding that they were working me to a breakdown  or  more likely  they didn t care   one day i saw a meme and it made me subscribe to this subreddit  that meme bounced around in my head for weeks  you ve seen it- it s the one that goes  paraphrased   you want a two week notice  you should ve noticed i was about to quit two weeks ago  and damn  that s just glib wordplay  but it got me  i was working to the bone and my superiors just didn t have enough power of empathy to see i was about to break  if they didn t care what i was dealing with  i didn t have to care what they were dealing with  i thought about that tweet for a few weeks- more than two- before one day i decided i was done  i waited until the last hour of my shift and then wrote a polite but firmly written email to my superior wishing her the best of luck on her future endeavors  i said that i was terminating my employment  effective immediately  i sent the email from my work computer and i told one associate  who i knew loved to gossip  as one last gift to her  and then i walked out at the end of my shift  with my superior not having checked her emails yet  and never came back   i didn t have a back-up plan  my only plan was to casually look for a job while enjoying my time at home  my spouse still had their job  but it was not enough income by itself  i had gotten myself free but for how long  would the next job- and there had to be one  because my spouse s job makes them miserable too- be just as bad  but with new faces  and then  randomly i saw a buddy who works in shared chat community for homebrewers ask if anyone was interested in a taproom position  i fucking jumped on it   i work at a brewery now  and it s changed my life  i don t just like going to work  i like it more than staying home  before i worked that shitty retail job  when i had time for hobbies  my main hobbies were homebrewing beer and mead and going to festivals with a booth so i could pass it out to people  homebrewers cant sell their beer legally  and without a venue they cant easily share it  i was working booths at festivals for free and it brought me more joy than anything in the world  it was my passion and joy  but it was actually costing me money  after 2019  covid ended all the fests  which meant i didn t have a reason to brew anymore  without homebrewing  i didn t have anything but retail to pour my passion into  i had abandoned all of my hobbies and let depression make my decisions for me   now i have my life back  i m homebrewing again  because i m constantly talking about beer and it has reignited my passion  once the brewery gets their pilot system up  i ll even be able to put my own beer on tap  i m being paid better than any of the other jobs in my working life up to this point  mid thirties  because i earn tips  but i also earn a decent wage before tips  i took about a 50 cent wage dip from my retail job  but after tips i m making about what i was before on a fraction of the hours  what s more  i enjoy my work  and that s where we get to the point where r antiwork makes me feel like a phony   i see a lot of discussion about ambition in this subreddit  in particular  i see trolls posting about how people here think ambition is bad  but that s not right  is it  i think most people get it- ambition isn t bad  by itself  work is not inherently bad  but ambition to make capitalists a bunch of money is a sad  sad ambition  that s not where your energy and passion belong   but  like  mankind only gets so much time on this earth  wanting to do something specific and productive with that time  that s not sad  that s like  giving meaning to your life  it s not sad to want to work  if you ve found work that makes you proud  that fills you with passion  that s working for yourself  if you find something that sparks that kind of passion  you should do it as much as possible  and that usually wont be possible  not everyone has a kind of work that makes them feel that way  and those people should try to figure out how to live and be happy on as little work as possible   this is not an endorsement of  working what you love  yeah  no shit life can be good if you get paid to do work you love  i know that s not an option most people have  i m not telling you guys to do what i did  because i think it s abundantly clear that what i did was get lucky  i m just saying that it s okay to be subscribed to this subreddit and not fully hate work  because i do love to work  i love leisure very  very much  but i love the serotonin high i get from accomplishing things even more  i just love to do my work and i don t want to have to worry about whether or not there s money in it   i hope there s other people like me out there- people who hated work enough to walk away without a plan and rediscover the work that makes life feel meaningful  and if you have a hobby that you had to cut from your life because work didn t give you enough time  i implore you  find a way to take your hobby back  it s more important than it seems  and it s worth fighting for- to find the work you would do as recreation ,plnqnm

3392,Major shift in worldview,hello   a brief background on me prior to the avalanche of brain nonsense that is to come  i am a 22 year old male  in the digital media industry about to finish community college and probably enter the workforce   i remember up until about 3 weeks ago i was totally fine and content with spending the foreseeable future working and  grinding  to get ahead and get the things that i wanted in life  note that these things were mostly all material such as a house  car etc  in fact  i had spent most of my summer  trying to get ahead and worked on my portfolio so that i might have a competitive advantage over my classmates and be more employable   then  seemingly out of the blue 3 weeks ago  my wonderful partner asked me if i would ever consider moving out of the country  living abroad for some time  immediately i was in  it sounded like such a good idea  for some context i live in one of the most expensive 1st world countries in the world  in one of the most populated cities in that country  i have long dreaded the moment where i would have to leave my parents house and have to pay some crazy high rent prices that would essentially drain my entire money earned for that month  seems like a pointless exercise  grinding away all day to be able to sleep somewhere at night  i'm sure you all agree   i did a lot of research  checked other places around the world where i might be able to live for cheaper and thus have to work a lot less than before  spain and portugal seemed to be 2 great places that would offer what i was looking for  significant discounted cost of living  wonderful weather and beautiful scenery   so here i am now  i have this new mindset  forged in less that 3 weeks  that work culture is the dumbest thing ever  grind and hustle mindset are super cringe and most importantly  what the actual fuck is the point of working 40 years non stop to be able to retire and enjoy life when i'm old and out of my prime   i want to experience life to the fullest  i am willing to give up some luxuries that i have become accustomed to in order to do this  i am totally fine with never owning a car  going on lavish vacations or even owning that house with the picket fence  i am fine with living in the country side in spain in a house that costs exactly what it should  riding my bike into town and doing whatever the fuck i want each and every day   i feel that i am young enough still and without many responsibilities that a lot of people have such as mortgages or children that i can strive for work free life  or life as my own boss that so many people desire   i mean what the fuck  we only have this one life  why would i do anything at all that i don't want to do ,plr6va

3394,If I ever get to be a political person this is my idea to fix min wage,imo min wage should always be be  xh  what it takes to live not paycheck to paycheck  like average cost of rent  food  water  etc in the area minus entertainment plus 10  extra so the person isn't living paycheck to paycheck  like if yearly it takes  30k to live  this adds an extra  3k as a buffer    2000  the problem with saying places must pay  15 or  10 or whatever is even if you hit the number today  it simply isn't going to be right tomorrow  so here is my idea   min wage should be calculated based on where the person works  and the employer must pay at least the min wage calculated for their area  cities themselves will be required to have these calculations and they must update it every 6 months  like an exact day  and the figure the city puts out must be easily accessed by everyone so workers and companies know exactly what is required    and every 5 years the city must be audited by outside firms and if the city has been found to broke the rules in how to calculate min wage living  they will have a heavy fee to pay   for companies that complain about keeping up with payment changes every 6 months  the advice will always be pay above to add buffer  for companies that complain about this cost too much  the words will come down it  sadly this is simply the cost of business and to make sure everyone  has the right to not be homeless     amp x200b   this doesn't solve medical and a few other things  but it should make it where if someone did work at a job for the normal 40 hours a week or a mix of jobs that add up to 40 hours a week  and they still can't make it    amp x200b   thoughts ,pllf3w
3395,How do I stop accepting overtime?,i am 27 and i currently work at a security company  one of the things that bothers me about working at this company is working overtime and working extra on weekends  tomorrow i got to do a 8 hour shift and i know i really don't want to  i don't mind working some parts but i want to only do the hours that i'm assigned to do  the couple of reasons why i am afraid of not accepting overtime is the repercussions of getting fired for not doing ot  the other issue i have is that i live with my dad and he still has a bit of a boomer mentality about work  he thinks i should say yes to working extra overtime or working on weekends  i am not like him in his work ethic  i just want to do my 8 hours and enjoy my weekend  my dad thinks i shouldn't quit until i have another job lined up but i don't want to keep working at my current job any longer  how do i tell my boss or my dad no more often to working overtime ,plp4to

3412,The cost of a successful life, in the relentless busyness of modern life  we have lost the rhythm between work and rest   our culture invariably supposes that action and accomplishment are better than rest  that doing something - anything - is better than doing nothing    because of our desire to succeed  to meet these ever-growing expectations  we do not rest    because we do not rest  we lose our way   we miss the compass points that would show us where to go   we bypass the nourishment that would give us succor   we miss the quiet that would give us wisdom   we miss the joy and love born of effortless delight   even when our intentions are noble and our efforts sincere  even when we dedicate our lives to the service of others  the corrosive pressure of frantic over-activity can nonetheless cause suffering in ourselves and others   a  successful  life can become a violent enterprise   - wayne muller,plokk1

3451,How slavery changed throughout time,note pretty much all of this still goes on today depending on location   first slavery   back in the day you capture some war enemy  some random  someone you didn't like  then force them to work or do whatever  if they don't do whatever then kill them or hurt them   serfdom   basically it's like above but there was rules against how you can kill them  it was illegal for the owner to cause anything that could cause the person to bleed  but it was 100  within the rules to kick the person outside of their home and let the weather kill them  and if the leave the area  then they can legally be hunted down  and if they eat anything on the land then that would be stealing with the lord owns everything on the land outside of the person   prison   this should be obvious  but you're strip of all rights  anything you own  anything you do  and so on  you can't talk if the guards warden doesn't want you to  you can be locked away in a tiny hole with no bathroom  you can be forced to work where the jail makes a ton of money but in return the prisoner if they make anything then it's literal cents  and instead of society just killing off someone who will obviously spend the rest of their life in prison  the person will be forced to live like this for the rest of their life  with no real rights  punish for just talking when the guards don't want them to  in small cells  and so on    note  it isn't that i think we need to get rid of prisons  but what is the point of them  they aren't reforming people  it's basically sweeping a problem under a rug   work camps   where you lived in company houses and shop at company stores  the worse of them had it where you were paid in company money  but you always made less than what was needed to stay alive  so you were always in debt   modern worker   places like fb and other places have threaten to massively cut pay to fully remote workers if they move outside of an area  not because they need them to physically come in or anything ever  but it turns out a lot of the business that were highly anti-remote work  like saying their workers didn't want it so they weren't going to get it  the company  the managers  and or the heads own lots of land in their area  this means you rented your house from your boss  you shop at your boss store  and so on even in an indirect way   in some cases  if you don't live in the area where your boss owns land then you can lose up to 25  of your pay ,pllrw9

3568,The hate towards those who don't work,i live in a country which values work very much  so much that it is seen as a virtue in itself  the common phrase is that  all work is good  the most important talking point of politicians is how to decrease unemployment rates  since you are child  everybody teaches you to value work over everything else  studying and learning new skills is only considered worthwhile if they lead to better position in the job market  it is generally accepted that people have burn outs because of work  in some places  having a burn out is seen as achievement  people who work extra time with no pay are admired  mental troubles are viewed as an accepted collateral damage of work    and if you somehow aren't part of that  people hate you  if you are open about your anti-work views in social media  you can get death threats and harassment  especially older people get very angry  if you openly despise work culture  you are almost a sub-human  or a freeloader who lives with  someone's tax money   well  some people should learn more about where corporations get their money from  politicians who promote cuts in the social security and unemployment benefits are popular  people see unemployment as a fault of an individual  and if you don't have a job  people expect you to do any job you can get  there are people with university degrees who work in fastfood restaurants or as toilet cleaners   some unemployed people are so ashamed of their situation  which is often caused by capitalism  that they pretend to work  they wake up early and take a bus to somewhere so that people think that they are heading to work  then they come back home and drink for the rest of day    if you are trying to explain why people should be anti-work  you get either hate or just a confused look and an answer like  well  people got to work  how else they can make a living  if you explain how workers are exploited  most people just start to talk about how there is no alternative and how  communism  never worked    and no  this is not about japan or usa ,pkufcw

3601,"I beat the British Military, an 8month FIFA player, left with a better paying job, big payout and beat the market for nearly seven figures!", i beat the british military  an 8month fifa player  left with a better paying job  big payout and beat the market for nearly seven figures    amp x200b   so a bit of background i reached my mid-twenties  having flunked around at university and done various minimum wage jobs and decided enough was enough  and i was tired of crummy pay   i met a girl whose dad was an officer in the raf  and after going around to his lovely suburban home with a nice car  i decided this was the life for me    i would later leave that girl a couple of weeks into basic training  cheating whore  story for another time    amp x200b   roll on four years  and i have started to make a good go of things  i had two highly recommended reports for promotion  three reports with a minimum of recommended are required to be put forward for promotion  given annually   these four years were great  i had some really good friends who i still keep in contact with until this day   the work was easy enough  and i was crushing it in my line managers eyes  there were pros and cons up until this point that many in this subreddit would hate  we had to stay behind after work for a couple of hours without any workers rights   weekends for marching parades  calling 18year old officers 'sir'   this was balanced out with having almost half days on a friday and 38 days holiday to use   i was single at the time and lived on base paying  30 a month for accommodation and bills   this gave my  21k a year salary a bit more of a punch    amp x200b   going into my final year to get a good report  i was drafted out to qatar to work at the coac   i worked an admin role out there sitting and watching hours of live drone footage with the occasional bomb being dropped   i was never really a military guy and didn't take much satisfaction watching people die  even if they were the 'so called' bad guys   it was on this tour where everything went downhill for my career      amp x200b   the shifts we did were terrible for my body clock   we did two days of 12-hour shifts  6 am-6 pm  then had 24hours to change our body clock and do two days of  6 pm-6 am   then once we finished our rotation  we would get either 36hours or 60hours of recovery time before our next four-day cycle   on the face of it was not too bad  but you were expected to stay in this rotation for the full four months of your tour   i could have probably pushed through this tour with the right amount of morale   unfortunately  i was dealt a shitty hand and paired with an asshole of an officer for my shifts   this whole tour is a story in its self and one i may share   cliffs  i was shattered out of my mind towards the end and made minor mistakes that made that officer lean on me too much   i finally cracked and walked down to the medical centre  having a borderline breakdown   within a day  i was on a plane home and finished my tour three weeks early   it felt good knowing that asshole would be snowed under in my absence    amp x200b   so i get back to the uk  where i need to report to the medical officer   they sign me off for a couple of weeks to mentally recover   my girlfriend was supportive when i got back  and i began my road to recovery      amp x200b   upon returning to my home base  management had changed a lot since i left for qatar   there was a new squadron leader  and we'll call him old timer and a new warrant officer  we'll call him bootlicker    amp x200b   day one of my return old timer pulls me into his office and gives me a solid welcome back   he asks a little about what happened in qatar but tells me everything is a clean slate and to work at the level i was before my tour   great  i thought   i work a further six months   life was easy  the job was cushy   but i started to despise all things military  i hated calling people sir just because they had a certain rank on their shirt  i hated anything that infringed on my time outside of working hours  such as marching parades   but still  non of these things were deal-breakers yet   because i had started to hate being in the military  i decided to move off camp with my gf and found an apartment 10  minutes drive away   things were great  i started to have more of a work-life balance  i got that great feeling when i drove off camp every day   work was becoming a minor part of my life  and it just became 40hours i needed to be somewhere each week   i started to realise my  21k didn't go as far when i needed to pay  800 a month on rent plus bills   for some perspective  my girlfriend was working in mcdonalds and earning nearly 16k a year with overtime   albeit she didn't have private medical and free dental   but in the uk we have nhs anyway  and i have strong teeth and never needed a filling in my life      amp x200b   but i was in line for a promotion  right  that would have bumped me up to around 31k   old timer said i had a clean slate and my work for the last 6months had been good  and i never took any sick days   report writing comes  old timer is too high a rank to write my report  and bootlicker didn't write reports for people in our department yet   so they drafted a senior nco from a different department to write my annual report  we'll call him penfold  looked exactly like the cartoon character   penfold writes an average bang report and gives me a 'developing' for my overall score   the way the promotion board looks at your last three years  any 'developing' basically puts you bottom of the pile   so just like that  a guy who barely knew me writes me up and wipes out three years of work   i told colleagues  and they said i should fight it   but deep down  i was done    amp x200b   for the following two months  i went soul searching  i was creeping 30 with a shitty salary and a job i now hated with each passing day   i had a friend who lived in gibraltar and worked for an online poker company   i knew a lot about online poker and figured i could work my way into that industry with my admin skills and experience with the product   i spent most of my early 20s playing poker for a living  and it supplemented my salary whilst i was in the military   i visited him  and he showed me how he was living the dream in this sunny paradise  earning 60k a year and working in poker  something i have always loved    amp x200b   that was it  i was going to do everything i could to get into this industry   upon returning from that holiday  i instantly put in my resignation   now here is the kicker  i see many stories here where people hand in their two weeks notice gladfully or don't even do that and quit on the spot and walk out      amp x200b   that is not happening in the military  and you can be court marshalled and jailed    amp x200b   instead  once you hand in your resignation  you have to work a further 12months until you can leave   this means you can't job hunt until the last 3 4 months  so unlike civies  where you can apply whilst you still have a job and monkey branch across without the risk of unemployment  this system leaves you working months with the impending anxiety of not getting a job in a field you want    amp x200b   it is a great trap mechanism   but it did come with a get-out clause  if you received a job offer during your resignation period  you could leave if your commanding officer was willing to sign off on it   now my co  old timer  had released a friend of my 6months prior and within a three-week time scale   with this knowledge  i began half-arsed throwing my cv to companies that i would move heaven and earth to work for  but i had low expectations as i was only one month into my resignation timeline   i had a few interviews and finally heard back from one who offered me a job in malta      amp x200b   bingo  they sent me an official job offer with a start date in four weeks  the very next day  i walked into work with the printed job offer and directly handed it to both old timer and bootlicker   they seemed shocked that i'd managed to get a job so fast  and the job offer showed the starting salary   given that the military pays pretty poorly these days  i am sure when old timer saw the starting pay for my new job was in reaching distance of his and may have been slightly jealous  he'd dedicated 35years of his life to this job be on 60kish towards the end   he took the paperwork and said he would get back to me soon  i did push and said  can it be soonish  given the start date and the fact it's in another country  i would need to get my affairs in order pronto     amp x200b   i accepted the job offer and began organising myself to leave  there was no reason to keep me  i had like seven months of actual work time left when you factor my holidays  and we just became well-staffed for the first time in two years   i figured it was a slam dunk    amp x200b   two weeks pass  and i still haven't heard anything  i keep plaguing each manager  wtf is going off   i jump between old timer  bootlicker and penfold  who had become a secondary manager to me as well  bullshit  but whatever i was leaving   after avoiding me for two weeks  penfold rings me to deliver the news   all three of them had held a meeting and decided i was to see out my 12 months because 'manning' was an issue at the moment   'fucking little wankers ' i thought   i reminded penfold on the phone of the mental anxiety i had from qatar and gave him a wink that it would likely resurface now  he called my bluff and said we have excellent medical facilities  and they would be willing to help    amp x200b   i put the phone down  shaking  my dreams felt shattered  and i felt physically sick at the thought of returning to that office and working with those guys as my bosses for another seven months   i sat up late into the night thinking of a plan  i wrote on my phone notepad all my thoughts and feelings tinged with lies of a drinking problem and added a suicidal tone in there as well   i am sorry to anyone reading this that may be suicidal  and the fact i sunk so low to use that is not something i am proud of   my home life was great with my girlfriend  and i wanted to cut off that cancer which was my job   and i was prepared to fight fire with fire   i knew the only way the military would take me seriously was if i was suicidal and drinking was involved    amp x200b   very next morning  i ring the station medical centre and ask for an emergency appointment  specifically with a non-military doctor   this was important because my mental breakdown was due to the confines of military rule  and i couldn't be dealing with some uppy little shit officer trying to push me back into work    amp x200b   to be honest  i didn't need to fake anything  i was pent up with nerves  anxiety and rage  i was stuttering and muttering and literally handed the doctor my phone with all the notes i had made the previous night  i hadn't slept  and i purposely looked like shit as well   she was friendly and told me to go for a walk to shake off some of my anxiety   she signed me off for three weeks and booked me a meeting with a mental health specialist    amp x200b   one week to go for my start date  and i am still holding out that there is like a 10  chance i can still make it  i hope the three musketeers decide the juice isn't worth the squeeze with me      amp x200b   they don't and double down to entrap me   i keep in contact with the job in malta  and they say they're willing to wait a few more weeks for me  this gives me some breathing room  and i decide to push forward on a full medical discharge for my mental state   i knew going into the mental health assessment they needed a named condition before they could discharge me   so i began researching all the various mental health illnesses  my initial thought was i was going to stick with crippling anxiety until i came across bipolar   as i read through this condition  i started to realise it was a tick sheet for myself   but weirdly enough  it was something i knew about myself but had managed to self medicate for years unknowingly   i would have mad spouts of depression which i could quickly turn around by destroying myself in the gym for 3months and eating clean   i would go from skinny fat to six-pack ready for the beach in literally two months  and i would get high off people complimenting my quick turnaround   this is something i had performed without fail throughout my 20s  and i had become relatively efficient at it   my mum was also diagnosed with it  and i know it runs in the family     amp x200b   so theoretically  i wasn't even lying in my assessment but instead bringing to light something i had managed to control anyway   this whole situation most likely brought out the worst part of this disorder   looking back  at the time  i believed i was lying and just using these doctors to get out asap      amp x200b   this didn't work  but instead  they just signed me off long term sick where i would have to visit the doctors bi-weekly   this meant the job was in the bin   a full medical discharge would take months to push through   upside  i was getting full pay and only had to see a doctor every two weeks   i enjoyed this time at home with my gf  she worked still  but i was always around  and we had a lot of fun  i played fifa 19 every day and built a pretty decent ultimate team   i was living the dream to be honest   my future was always on the horizon  and that did give me a lot of anxiety     amp x200b   because i was in the military  bootlicker would have to check in on me every couple of weeks  we would have the occasional phone call where we both pretended like i would do a day's work at the office before i left  doctors had promised me that they'd keep signing me off until i finished  i was going through the motions before my official medical discharge    amp x200b   three months before i left  one of the nurses suggested filling out this military compensation form and highlighting the onset of my anxiety and bipolar from my time in qatar   i did this and sent it off with no second thought    amp x200b   medical discharge successfully goes through  and they give me a date which is in six weeks   boom  all engines go  i had to get my ass in gear and find a job   i started firing my cv off again and had a few interviews  but pay sucked  and it wasn't quite malta   i thought that ship had sunk  but my gf just told me to ring the manager and see if that job was still available   it seems obvious looking back  but i didn't even think of that as an option   i did it with little expectations  and he offered me the job outright after some deliberation with his higher-ups  i had to be there in a month  so we sold all our furniture  car the lot     amp x200b   the last week of living in my old apartment  i got a letter from the military compensations bureau stating i would be receiving 18k in compensation   i couldn't believe it  this was the most amount of money i had in my life   i had also spent those eight months reading self-help guides and financial books like rich dad poor dad   i knew i needed to invest this money    amp x200b   i moved to malta in march 2020 just as covid-19 crash hit all the markets  and the 18k slid in my account around the same time   i have also been into cryptocurrency since 2016 and held some bitcoin   it was the perfect storm  and i bought as much ethereum as i could at around  130  i have not sold any of that since and now have life-changing amounts of money    amp x200b   i am still in that malta job and now worked for there for 1year   6months and received a promotion   i read this thread and encountered the same corporate greed and crap in this job  but after my military experiences  i try to stay humble and be thankful for my current situation   ultimately i intend to hodl my crypto until a point where i feel i don't need to work again   those eight months of being with my gf and playing fifa were honestly incredible    amp x200b   tldr     i worked in the military for 4years  career going well    go on tour to qatar and have a shitty experience    come back and get a shit report  promotion reset for 3years    resign but can't leave for 12months   hear about a get-out clause if you get co approval  get a job offer   i get a job offer   co denies   lose job   go sickbay and get signed off for the remainder of my term   eight months playing fifa 19 fully paid   get the original job offer    get paid 18k compensation for the time in qatar   lump it all on crypto at the bottom of the market   looking forward to retirement from this bullshit,pkfmdq

3623,Even with a cushy job as a software engineer... man... working for money is depressing,just wanted to get this out there so maybe some can learn from my experience   so when i was starting my career  some people did this thing where they would get out of college and basically try to speed run a career  so they'd study for a google facebook netflix interview  get the job  live the most frugal life possible  and put every dollar towards retirement so they could retire by 30-40  they'd go so far as to live in vans in the parking lot and eat nothing but chicken rice broccoli that they'd buy in bulk   now i get why they did that  once you get to 30 you realize this is completely unmaintainable and soul crushing   i've noticed owners of business  are not the same as the rest of us  i got my first job at 14 picking apples  the owner of the orchard took great pleasure in firing literal children  then when their parents came to pick them up  he would berate their parents about how shitty their kid was for  not being a good worker  my next job  at 15  was at a pizza place mostly staffed by refugees  the boss would come in every day  then empty the tip jar for himself and explain  i have two kids  in private college  so i need this money more than the workers  bruh  most of these guys here are literally just trying to afford rent in their ghetto 1-bedroom that they share with another family  jfc   and in software  it's no different  i worked in a small company where we'd have direct contact with the ceo and his behavior was just  callous  we had a product we had to release to bring to a major conference  we all worked our asses off  one of my coworkers literally rented a hotel directly next to work to cut out the commute and worked 14 hours a day  i was there nights and weekends  but i felt i was being  clever  by asking for comp time   you know what happens right after the release  he fires us for  not working hard enough  meanwhile he worked a 3 day workweek  my manager is pissed because  they didn't even tell him  so gets another job and they offer him a measly 5  raise to stay  he declines  two weeks later  they text him and say  we thought it would be hard without you but we don't need you  excuse me  but what the fuck  and as for my comp time  they just shrug and say  what comp time lol  got that in writing anywhere  try and find it in your email oh yeah you can't  and what happens next  they outsource all the maintenance and new development to moldovan and ukrainian developers that they pay 30k year  then the boss goes to the conference and presents it smugly like he  personally  sat down and wrote all this code himself  you know what he was doing that whole time  come to find out  he wasn't even logging onto his computer  he was at his  third house  in a vacation destination just hanging out  that's right  he had 3 houses  his one 5 bedroom home in the most bougie part of town  a  guest house right next to it that had 5 bedrooms  and a  vacation home in the mountains  and he told us time and time again  listen the business just can't afford to pay developers more   sorry   and i can't confirm this  but i am almost certain that the boss of this company found a way to drag our names through the mud  because finding a job after  even as a software engineer  was next to impossible in my city  if i applied anywhere  i would never get a response or a near instant no  even after applying to hundreds or thousands of positions  it felt like i was blacklisted  i had to move across the country  where i was able to find an abundance with just a few applications   so whenever i hear  workers aren't working hard enough  i feel a knot in my stomach remembering these times ,pka9p3

3644,Why I Left the American Federal Government as a Biologist,hoping to use this post to encourage other people to change how they view work and to also set some reality for other young people thinking of taking this path   when i tell people i worked as a wildlife biologist for the federal government that specialized in endangered species  people usually ask my why i left or how  cool  of a job it must have been  i used to put on a face and tell them it was good while it lasted  but now i'm just honest about how it was 95  bullshit  the 5  are the just as frustrated friends i made along the way and the hands-on learning    when i graduated college with my bachelor's degree i did a 6 month stint on a wildlife reservation for usfws partnering with americorps  similar to peace corps  i had to do this in order to have an upper-hand against the other people who would also be fresh out of college and applying for fed jobs  i was paid less than minimum wage because you are technically considered a  volunteer    it came out to  600 a month    3 75 hr   i was lucky enough that my station provided housing  most did not  you are also given food stamps  i always found it highly ironic that i would qualify for food stamps while serving the government    while working alongside highschoolers who got paid  15 hr but who had been hired through an outreach program in the community to help give kids experience to get into college  this is bullshit  most colleges will let you in if you have a gpa over 3 and money in your hands    after this it was impossible to find work in the winter in my field so i went home and applied for the next season  this  volunteer work  had given me an upper-hand though and i qualified for a position with the bureau of land management the next summer    this job paid me minimum wage  13 hr  with no benefits and was only guaranteed for 6 months   i was expected to hike up and down ridiculously steep grades 6-8 hours a day  i was openly told we were the most hated branch of the government and that was why our cars were unmarked  but we also are not allowed to carry guns  tazers  or mace into the back country with us  they gave us a cheap air compression blow horn and radio  your closest partner is  45 minutes away   this was when i was beginning to realize this was not the work i was meant for    i wanted to help these animals that were going extinct due to human abuse of the earth   however i quickly realized i was only there to record the numbers of their extinction  i often came home crying and depressed about the helplessness i felt  i went back the next year for one more 6 month term and when i witnessed a head biologist come under fire for advocating climate change  i knew i needed to leave    the federal government  at least the biology side of it will only hire you for 6 month terms until you have worked 4 6-month terms  then you can qualify to apply for a 1 year term  after two 1 year terms you can qualify to apply for a four year term and that's as long as you get guaranteed  you will have to reapply for your job every four years  hr is obligated to contact  interview  and offer the job to any interested veterans before they'll look at civilians  but if you were the person doing the 4 year job  they will more than likely just reinstate you    i was 22 working alongside people in their late thirties who had long since qualified for those year long terms  but weren't veterans or didn't have phd's or for whatever reason were continuously skipped over  while also working under people in their late twenties early thirties who had stayed in college and gotten a phd  if you have worked for the feds for 16 years on foxes without a phd and someone applies to the same job as you with minimal field experience and brand spanking new phd  chances are you aren't going to get the job  knowing someone in the office won't help you either  applications are usually gone through by hr  sometimes a third party hr  to try to alleviate bias    if you don't plan on continuing your education  you will hit a ceiling regarding wages  once you have hit the top wage for someone with a bachelor's degree they will not bump your pay based on experience  you will need to get a master's degree  once you hit that ceiling you will need to get a phd    i left to make part-time at a dispensary that was going to pay me more plus tips  i spent my new off-time making art  reading  gardening  and volunteering with community environmentalists  the woman who owned the dispensary liked my work and took me under her wing  she showed me how to start my own business and now i work as a compliance contractor helping legal recreational marijuana farms file their forms with the county state and offer advice on how to better follow the laws and standards set by the state  i make my own hours  i make twice as much money as i did working for the feds  and i am treated with respect by my coworkers  boss  and the farmers i help  i also have a consulting company for people who want to start homesteading which is something i used to dream about doing when i retired lol i'm not even 30 yet    i used to stay up at night dreading what might happen should i choose to leave this career path i had worked so hard to set myself on  what would my parents think if i left the feds for weed  would the pay really be better  would i have stability   two years later and its the best decision i could have made  i watched friends go unpaid when the government shut down  i watched friends whose jobs were supposed to be 6 months get turned away after the first because of covid  i have friends who live in vans and cars just trying to fight their way to something more than a 6 month position    i am thankful to have taken the leap of faith and landed safely on the other side  i am starting the process of buying my own house and my partner and i have never had this kind of financial security  all it took was dropping the veil of what having a  respectable  job looks like and losing the obligation to serve a country workplace that doesn't serve you ,pkdf07

experience wasn't much  i started out in my 20's so i didn't know much  after the first month i was put in charge while the owner left for vacation  wouldn't have been an issue but we had an order a chain store  the job had me doing data entry  customer service  taking calls from both customers and vendors  production and shipping just after one month  miraculously it seemed all went well until a few weeks after they came back and got a call from the chain store  i screwed up with the invoice  i used the same invoice   for all the different stores  it took a couple of hours to fix  really no big deal and the owner realized it was a huge order to have left me in charge with   years down the road with raises additional bouses and more tasks piled on  having to work both office and production while having to deal with customers accounts vendors plus employees who were forgetful even though they did the same thing almost every single day  production would halt and orders placed on hold when we ran out of supplies stock of items to finish the product needed to ship orders to customers  that people forgot to mention we were low on  since i was technically  managers  for both the office and warehouse the issue fell to me even though every department was in charge of their stocks inventory  it happened constantly to a point i had to hide items so at least we had back up stock and i would have to place order when i gave them my stockpile  so i was basically in charge of everything and everyone in the building   not only that my hours went from the normal 40 a week to 50-60 hours 6 days  i was drained from work but also had my own responsibilities at home that had me leaving the house a couple of hours after getting off work to pick up my mom who didn't drive  i was the only girl so the responsibility fell to me  i tried talking to her but it was like talking to a recorder  i got the same respond back that i was the girl so it was my job  thankfully my brothers realized how tired i was and picked her up 2-3x a week   back to the demanding work  things came to a head at times and when it was too much i would quit or at least tell the owner who would suddenly give me raises or days off  i loved the job  i was good at it but the environment and mostly the owner made it toxic draining  when my father passed i was only given one day off  had to come in the next day but broke down from time to time when talking to customers clients  the owner had told them what happened and they were shocked i was actually working  i only mamanged a couple of hours but the owner was pissed that i was leaving early while they were in a meeting  years later when the owner's father passed they used as an excuse to why they were acting the way that they were  i wasn't a bitch or petty and just told them take their time to mourn   got sidetracked again  sometimes no one wanted to take responsibility or accountability for the screw ups which fell on me  and sometimes they owned up to it because they knew i would try and quit again  no one in that building wanted my job  honestly no one was able to do my job    i did finally leave for a while but came back  i trained someone before i left and they quit before i left  i told them i wasn't extending it to train someone else  months later i got a call  i was short on cash so i took my job back but with less hours  found out that the person who was suppose to work my job quit within weeks they couldn't find another replacement before it got too busy  while i was gone 3-4 people had to take turns doing what i use to do to try and keep pace  so the owner was nice for a while   months go by and basically the same crap happens  there was a reason i actually quit  not much had changed  the owner was nice for a few months because i was needed  it became a cycle of me having to talk to the owner every few months and say i'm at the end of my rope for the owner to be nice and then back to the crap that made me want to quit  i put up with it for years as the pay was good with the bonuses  i  loved the job as it was a mix of both office and production so it wasn't too boring though it was chaotic  unfortunately the owner was too toxic  the turn around for people was quick  i didn't care as some help was much better than no help   a few years ago i quit and never looked back  they called and asked but i said no and stuck to it  with all the hours i worked i had a lot saved up  traveled and traveled some more   sorry for the long post  i was currently browsing job listings related to office  production and shipping as that is where my experiences are and not much has changed  companies still want workers to do everything for as minimal pay they can get away with

3661,"In theory, I don't actually mind work",i would be cool with work if it weren't for a few things  obviously  one of those things is i want to be paid a reasonable amount  what is this ten dollars an hour bs about  i also would prefer the typical shift wasn't 8 hours  it doesn't even have to be that much shorter  if the typical day was only 6 hours  i could deal with that  i wouldn't like it  of course  but i think i could handle it  the last big thing that bothers me about the majority of jobs is that i can't be good at them  they're jobs that require you to be good socially and put up with repetitive boring tasks  i can talk to people  but it's hard for me to communicate in this really smooth  professional way that's expected  and i quickly get drained by social interactions  i also have a hard time doing the same things over and over  it just becomes increasingly frustrating and intolerable  i understand most of these are personal problems rather than societal problems  but i just wish there were more jobs out there that i could feel competent at  it feels like most jobs are designed to fit only one type of person  for example  a lot of stuff can be done over email that they force you to do in person or over phone  another example is customer service workers are expected to start conversations with customers  why  i as a customer don't want to make small talk  i just want to pay for my shit and leave  it's like they think everyone is a social butterfly   tl  dr  i just want a job that doesn't make me feel tired and stupid everyday ,pki6af

3709,"don't overlook the power of a pointed, yet anonymous glassdoor review",my company  like so many corporations out there  is big of  diversity  amp  inclusion  - so naturally  senior management is almost exclusively older  white men  they do have some female middle management  but they are predominantly white women    they also don't do promotions  if a management job opens up above you  even if it's on your team  you apply for it just like everyone else  but obviously being the most qualified for the role makes it pretty difficult to not get the job  like say working on the team as a supervisor for 7 years and applying for that same team's now open manager position how could you not get the job  when the average transition time from supervisor to manager is 3 years  well apparently for this poc  person of color  supervisor  it was not so easy   this supervisor was not only competent  but well liked in the entire area so imagine our surprise when we find out that in order to not disrupt   the unity of the team  that this supervisor cultivated for her team  senior management went with an outside hire  that this supervisor then needed to train    about two weeks after the news broke  a glassdoor review was posted about our entire area  it was detailed  pointed  highly accurate  and brought to light the kind of stuff that made you carry your head in shame  the whole department knew the nepotism and favoritism in the departmen  and we knew that the diversity and inclusion talk was all bs but reading it on glassdoor was kinda like getting a scarlet letter  we all knew who posted it but assumed like everyone that management wouldn't care    we were wrong  a couple of days later the entire department was pulled into a meeting with a big wig flying in from new york  reaffirming the company's commitment to d amp i  and a few days after that a new management role opened up and guess who got the role   moral of the story is corporations do pay attention to these reviews because partners  universities  potential clients  competitors read them and pay attention  if your review is honest  like not a lie  don't be afraid to post it these kinds of reviews force businesses to at least pretend to follow the bull shit they spew,pk14te

3740,Got a bad job offer today,so  recently a new pizza place that is also a tap house  local chain  opened in my town  i applied for a job there and received an interview  i am in college  so i was only looking for part time  however  the manager insisted he is only looking to hire wait and kitchen staff for 58 hour weeks  i even offered to work the early morning shift for dough rolling  he still said no  when he found out about my college enrollment  his attitude changed and he skirted around the fact that even if i wanted to work 60 hours a week he wouldn t hire me knowing i am in college  i then found out half way through the interview that the reason for this schedule was because the business model for this location and all future locations is having people coming to the counter to both order and get their pizza when it is done  this means wait staff makes significantly less in tips  thus they have to work more hours    so 60 hours a week  no benefits  slim tips and having to constantly deal with drunken idiots  no thanks   enjoy high employee turn over  bud ,pk0pk4

3742,"A year ago, I quit my job",hey  all   so this is kinda the soft anniversary of when i really became disillusioned with my job  i discovered this sub recently  and i figure it d help me to put some of my thoughts to words  whether or not anything actionable comes out of it   i was working at my university s campus bookstore  i d gotten a couple of token raises  but the pay was only a sliver above minwage  i d been working there for 3 years  namely because they were willing to adjust my hours around my class schedule  and the managers were  all but one  always actively working alongside the employees   since a lot of the other employees were seasonal  i noticed gradual changes that others didn t  often preceded by some ghoul or another from corporate visiting and tut-tutting at the local managers  usually  these weren t big changes  but they were always a nuisance  on the mildest end  one of these regional managers wandered into the backroom to tell me i was hanging shirts the wrong way  a more egregious change  they phased out the mobile bookshelf units from the back room in favor of heavy shelves that could be rolled out to the sales floor for displays which made any backroom work much slower  especially at the start of the semester when there were tens of thousands of orders to be sorted   one of my favorite parts of the job was the overnight shifts right before the semester began  in which a few employees and a manager would blitz through gathering and boxing probably a good 400  online orders  not many people enjoyed them  but i was a big fan because your coworkers were grateful to get ahead of orders for the day  you didn t have to deal with customers interrupting you with asinine questions  and there was a great deal of satisfaction to be had from making visible progress on a quiet task  the first red flag for me should ve been when none of the managers wanted to do the overnight shifts in january of 2020  i d communicated to the store director that i was interested in upward movement where it was available  and she told me that i could fill the supervisor role because of my experience at the store  if this went well  they d be happy to promote me to a shift management position in april i think you see where this is going  the overnight shifts went well  and despite being myself and only one other person instead of the usual 4-5  we were able to keep a decent pace maybe 60  as much done as if the usual complement had been there as well  the store director was impressed  and outright said that she wanted to keep me on board  and there would be a promotion in store for me in april   when the pandemic intensified in late march that year  everything on campus closed down bookstore included  i spent that time on unemployment  making about double what i d make at the bookstore in half the time  i wanted to work  though  and when in june  i got a phone call about coming back to help with mailed-in rental books  i was more than happy to  from there  things kinda shifted to a  business as usual  attitude for the remainder of the summer  things were slow but manageable  and  stop me if you ve heard this one before  i assumed that the management would recognize all the hard work i was putting in and think it was still worth it to promote me  especially when the most junior manager was putting in his two weeks  notice  i brought up the possibility of getting that promotion again with the store director  and she still seemed on board for it  after things settled for start-of-semester in september  after this rush week  i contacted my manager again about the promotion  pointing out that i already do more work than other employees and just wanted my pay to reflect it  once again  the director agreed with me and said she d get back to me within the week  she did but in the same breath asked me what additional responsibilities i d take on to justify the pay raise to corporate   i m already writing a lot more than i expected to  so i ll just shorten this bit and say pandemic customers have made a sport of finding new and exciting ways to be awful to our friends in retail  and i was no exception with higher-risk members in my household  with no hazard pay  the university kicking and screaming to get another football season going  and corporate trying to block someone from getting a manager's pay for a manager's work  this was the breaking point  and the store director and i both knew it  i put in my two weeks  and said my goodbyes   i m lucky enough that as a student on quite a few scholarships  i d been able to save a good amount of money and coast on that  i m one of the lucky ones that i could take a year  off  and i ve been spending this time doubling down on writing and self-publishing  after all  if i m not going to make enough money to get by  why not fail to make enough while doing something i love instead   all of this said  i m finally approaching a turning point where i might need to get a  real job  again if only to maintain my health insurance  i m about to graduate  with surprisingly little student debt  small blessings  and with the pandemic showing no signs of letting up  i feel like going back to work is either a waste of time or a genuine source of danger to my household  i don t think there s really a thesis to all of this  other than just expressing my frustration  but hey  what else  are  we gonna do other than vent  thanks for listening  hopefully  this might serve as a cautionary tale for others not to push themselves past their limits - even when your bosses seem to be pulling for you  their hands might be tied    tl dr    i fell for the  work real hard and you ll earn that promotion  scam  my boss got blocked by corporate when she wanted to make good on a promotion  but i had the good fortune to spend the last year writing and self-publishing  now i ve gotta rejoin the workforce soon and am really not feeling it

3779,Am I paranoid or is my job setting me up to get fired?,long post  sorry in advance  i am a part time 3rd shift shelf stocker at a grocery store  firstly  i am fully aware that this may be due in part to my number of call ins  i have a nasty habit of calling in to work when i probably shouldn't  besides this  though  i go into work on time  do my job as instructed  and leave on time    next  the potential signs i'm wondering about   1  i'm getting less hours  i've gone from working 5 days a week  6 hours a shift  to working 2 days  or if i'm lucky  3  my boss has claimed that this is because of my call ins  and they want to  give me the time and space i need  what weirds me out is the fact that i know i'm not the only one in my department dealing with this problem - i've heard others bringing it up with management as well  and management claimed  it'll fix itself  on the other hand  rather than giving me the hours straight up  after i asked for them  the managers are pushing for us to volunteer in other departments  and have actually hired a bunch of new people for my department  allegedly due to being short staffed  however  even though they've hired more help  they continue to tell us that they're desperate for more hours to be filled  and despite me asking twice  i haven't received said hours   2  being left out of meetings  my managers have recently enacted a rule of having a department meeting every night to discuss issues  concerns  etc  despite this being an every night occurance  supposedly  there's only been about three on nights i have worked  i learned about things said at these meetings through my coworkers rather than the actual gathering itself  this could just be because my managers aren't bothering to have one every night  but it's hard to say   3  being given more work than i can handle  i'll admit  i'm not the fastest worker  but i certainly try  and genuinely take pride in my work when i can actually finish stocking up an aisle fully by the end of my shift  problem is  management likes to schedule me to work on 2 aisles rather than one  and after working here for about 7 months   they know i'm not equipped in either my hours nor my skill to get both completely finished in a reasonable time  it's immensely frustrating because i know i can finish one aisle when given the time  but having to work on 2 and sheepishy having to tell the manager that i couldn't get them both done seems a bit like they're setting me up for failure  they're also looking to add on more tasks to monitor our work  despite me and the rest of the department already having an issue completing what we have   4  i ordered new shirts a long while back and haven't received any  pretty self explanatory  i'm in need of new uniform shirts and haven't gotten any  despite usually being handed new shirts from the back the minute when i ask  i had to fill out an order form about a month ago and haven't gotten any  small gripe but i may be overthinking all this    5  they might have somehow learned that i reported one of their  best men  - an actively patronizing  toxic  and slightly sexist manager who had given quite a lot of time to the company  i imagine he may have figured it out himself an tattled on me given the constant tension between us but i can't exactly confirm nor deny this one   sorry about this long winded list  i'm incredibly anxious about this massive cut in hours because i'm going to be missing rent payments and likely not eating if this keeps up  i have already applied for partial unemployment and am waiting for that to kick in  thanks all ,pjz675

3841,Do dream jobs actually exist?,i ve been working for a couple of years to what you might consider a dream job  i got into it because when i found out that some people i admire has done the same  i thought i could do it too and it could be an interesting thing to pursue before i do what i really wanted to do in life    after studying in college and getting into my dream field  i wasn t working on projects that i really wanted to do  i thought that i needed to  pay my dues  before i get a chance to get hired on these huge projects  my field is essentially jumping from contract to contract with some unemployment breaks in between  so there isn t very much stability unless your get a staff job at a large company    while i was working at these  dream jobs  at aren t that great  i was taking private classes to level up my skills  i remember there was this one day at work that was going horribly  a lot of people on my team kept assuming that i knew how everything about how things worked around here even though i never got properly trained so i always had to learn on the fly  after a meeting  i went back to my desk  looked around the office and i got this epiphany  i realized this is not what i saw myself doing at this point in my life   that night  i talked about it to my then teacher  who is someone that has worked on these projects that i dreamed of working on  i told him about what happened at work and how i felt  he told me that even he has felt the same thing while working at these  dream jobs  it made me think  what s the point to stay in this field   so the years went by and i stayed in this field because it s all i know i could do for work and i kept seeing these same patterns everywhere i got hired  companies keep understaffing when there s clearly a need for more help on a project  they undertrained their employees because they don t want to and don t have the time  they always pay as cheaply as possible because they can easily manipulate you by saying you are doing this for the passion  they constantly expect from you to do unpaid overtime that slowly kills  production schedules keep getting tighter  on top of that  they expect high quality work done a low budget  there is more but the combination of it all creates a hostile environment   when covid hit and i started working from home  it was a little better but i can see this downward spiral where companies realizes they get even cheaper labor   so now  i am thinking of simply quitting but i m not sure what else i could do instead  i could go into an adjacent field but i see a lot of similar problems  what can i do  btw  that thing that i really wanted to do is somewhat in an adjacent field but i would rather do that as a hobby for free   i have a friend who has quit and suggested that i try what he does but i am afraid of getting into something with rose coloured glasses and then realizing it s not as great as it sounds to be   anybody else had a similar experience with their dream job  do dream jobs really exist ,pj3ny4

3934,Experience in Legal Profession,just thought i would share some personal experiences about the legal profession  one of the  good jobs  that we're told to aspire towards   for three years running at my law school  the valedictorian immediately left the legal profession within the next two years  one of them gave a valedictory speech about how the law degree is  our ticket to the middle class  why did the student body elect such people as their valedictorian  it's almost as though they saw people whose free spirit was still intact  who reflected some part of their inner yearning to not be caught in this drudgery  but for most of them that is a pipe dream  their path has been set  the tuition for that school is over  100k  and it's doubtful to make that back starting from scratch at a new profession   one thing i noticed was that there was a lot of children of politicians there  i had never met any myself in all my years attending public schools  but they seemed to flock to law school  i guess it operates like a seal of approval for children of privilege to enter the political class   from the graduating year one ahead of me  one first year lawyer killed herself by jumping from the law firm building--but not before finishing her memos for the days  those are important   yes  the average lawyer makes a pretty good salary  but you need to factor in that senior partners make half a million  bumping up the average in a way that is not reflective of the actual expected pay  the new lawyers are still making a decent amount  compared to the national average  but they have extra expenses like the requisite fancy suits  of course  expected outings at fancy restaurants  etc  and law society fees  which are several thousand dollars per year even if you quit the profession  they won't ask you to pay them if you aren't currently practicing  but they will accrue  and you pay a lump sum when you return  it's all engineered  it seems  to lock people into the drudgery   as a first year lawyer  you will be expected to prove how hard working you are by spending your whole life at the office  70  work hours is common  and probably not enough to prove you are  partner material  i know one person whose schedule included setting a timer at night to switch clothes from the laundry to dryer  because it was the only way to find time to keep his clothes clean   don't let anyone trick you into thinking this is a good job  it is shit  if you're thinking about it  get out  i'm glad i was able to avoid a career in law  but of course deeply regret getting the degree  i wish someone would have told me how shit it was  so i guess i am extending that favor to anyone thinking about it ,pj4ci4

3944,I want to see what is the opinion on Worker Cooperatives of this sub,a worker cooperative is a company that is essentially controlled by its workers  all decisions are voted on like a democratic country or are taken care by a management elected by the workers   in these companies the pay is shared more reasonably by the workers  so instead of a ceo making over x100 times the amount of what most workers do  it is organized by the workers so that harder and more demanding  positions pay better  but on average the pay discrepancy of the highest salary to the lowest is not over x10   the worker cooperative became a thing with the industrial revolution  they where created with the ideology of socialism in mind so that the workers were protected from wage insecurity and  work slave  mentality that a lot of factory owners had and still have   in these companies the sense of community is much stronger  with much better hours and bonuses  people that work for their  communities  have a higher sense of self worth and are happier  so much so that they are willing to sacrifice their time and well being for the group company without extra pay or necessities    amp x200b   what do you think about worker cooperatives  do you think they are feasible  would you like to work for one even being anti-work    amp x200b   disclosure   i'm not a professional on this  i just had some basic knowledge on this and just saw a video that reminded me of it  if there are any errors on what i'm saying please correct me and i will make an edit and fix it   also i'm not english native so if you see any spelling errors tell me and i will fix them also  thank you ,pimm01

3955,Need to vent,i m leaving my current job on friday and gave less than two weeks notice because my boss was dicking me around    one a contractor employee through a third party company for one of the most famous universities in the us  my position is administrative and i started a full 6 months before my boss  during that time i was doing basically her job in addition to general admin duties and working my ass off and by the time we interviewed her and hired her  i was on the hiring committee and felt that she would be awesome to work with  though she had never managed anyone before    now- the part of the university i work at is fairly new and has been sort of notoriously toxic to work for in circles around here  i was hired as a contractor and was told i would be converted when my contract was up  that didn t happen because of a  hiring freeze  but my contract was extended for another year  that s where i should have seen the first red flag  but i am dumb and liked what i was doing at the time so i stuck with it  they outright hired three people including my boss during that time    things were okay at first and i was basically training her how to be a manager  because i had managed people before and she hadn t  i just didn t want to manage people which is why i switched jobs in the first place    then come january  something happened and she basically became a micromanager and kept giving me stranger and more vague tasks and was upset when i couldn t meet her deadlines or when i asked for clarification  then she had me filling out a daily task list of everything i did and how long each task took me  because she didn t know what i did all day  she didn t know because she s a researcher and has never done administrative work before and didn t want to learn what i did    they extended my contract again once that one was up and told me they were getting ready to actually start the hiring process a few weeks ago  the job was posted and she conveniently forgot to tell me it was until it was almost too late  i got all my work in order and applied  thinking i would stay for a few more months to a year and then look elsewhere within my university  i went through the entire interview process- i filled out their questionnaire with answers and then they just picked my interview date and time because she  knows my schedule  they were 10 minutes late to my interview and it lasted less than 30 minutes when it was scheduled for an hour  no one asked me any real questions of substance and the questions i asked in return were met with  that s a good question  ill have to get back to you    then she went on vacation but not really because she had meetings she couldn t miss  when she came back from vacation  the hiring team met to discuss who they would hire that monday  i asked on tuesday if she had any information for me and she said she didn t and i told her that i had an offer and i wanted to consider my options without leaving anyone stranded  she was excited for me to have an offer  but she wasn t transparent with me about the process at all  she seemed surprised i had another offer as if i wasn t looking because nothing is for certain when it comes to interviews  well i waited and came to the conclusion that because they didn t tell me right away  i wasn t the chosen candidate and my work buddy on the hiring committee told me as much without telling me everything because she wasn t allowed to  she encouraged me to quit before i was out of two jobs    i asked her the next day if she had an answer for me and when she got really defensive and aggressive  i put in my resignation  if she was going to act like that  she didn t deserve two weeks notice  she tried to tell me that three weeks is required by this university  no  nothing is required in an at-will state ma am  you don t know the labor laws- you re not a good manager    since then  she s been basically micromanaging harder and being on a complete power trip  tuesday is a holiday for me and i opted to continue working but asked to be remote so i could be with my family  she declined and said that she had decided on-site work was necessary so i needed to be there  she said i could request the day off but just because i can request it doesn t mean she will approve it  my last day is this friday and i m stoked  she spent all of this past friday giving me impossible tasks with impossible timelines knowing i had tasks that required me to drive around all day and be offline  too    i was very close to quitting right then and there and i think that s what she s trying to get me to do    i was also told that this was her first time ever going through the hiring process and she s never hired anyone before  i ve done that too and it s not that hard  i was told that the whole process was a mess by three different people i work with    i m glad i m getting out of there  i m just annoyed that this is how it s going down  i wish that i could have stayed to leave on my own terms with benefits    anyone think i m going crazy  or that i m reading this wrong  she chose her words very carefully to say i was denied my request to work from home and then told me i could request the day off  not that i could take the day off  she s a phd- i know that she thought about this a lot to cya ,pitdht

4067,I know there are a lot of complaints (and lots of valid ones too!) but what are some actionable solutions we can take to change society for the better and what does that look like to you?,as the title says- i have been lurking here for a while and identify with a lot of points   what i haven t seen much of are actions that everyone can take to change the state of things   i know this is an incredibly complex and interconnected system that does not respond well to change but since everyone here has such great reasons to change this broken system i figure y all would have some actions anyone can take at least   also there are a lot of problems  like  if minimum wage would go up then prices would have to increase and consumers might not be able to pay those fair prices  just one example of many   either way i want to hear what you think ,pj2ny8

4116,How/When did the American people become convinced that Living Wage is a ''privilege''?,this isn't a rhetorical question  i'm genuinely curious as this seems like a good place to get an answer   when the minimum wage was introduced by f d r's administration in 1938  it was supposed to enable every working person to acquire the basic necessities of independent living  however  60  years later  a huge majority of older americans are convinced that a living wage is a privilege and people like fast food restaurant cooks and farm-hands don't deserve a living wage because their jobs are ''unskilled labor''  furthermore  if such workers complain about this  they are called ''entitled''   officially  but not legitimately  capitalism is a social contract between the elite and the working class in which the working class will work for money which they will use to better themselves  if your employer does not pay you a living wage  there is absolutely no point in working for said employer    so i'm genuinely curious how boomers and gen x'ers were brainwashed into perceiving living wage as a privilege and not a right ,pi2scs

'amusement' as ive only just logged back on after a while of not being on reddit and seen a few people trying to slag this group off on this page   so i would like to share a brief story of why i am personally a member of this group and what led me here  please feel free to object or argue any points as i am always willing to grow my perspective on things   i am 27 in the uk  i did an apprenticeship from the age of 17-21 and i enjoyed it so i do understand how it feels to not understand people who dont like work   all i would say is if your here because your curious about what we think and how we see things  then ask us politely  this is a discussion thread i am sure there is more than a dozen people online all the time that would be happy to share their perspective with you    if your struggling to relate just a little bit  then imagine you were in a job that was not satisfactory and it brought nothing for you but stress and a bit of pocket money after your bills  now stress can affect your energy levels  your physical and mental health and motivation etc so never underestimate what stress can do too you  now changing jobs is easy enough if you can find one  but what if this next job is worse  what if the manager or the work colleagues are not nice  what if they make you work longer hours for nothing  well you got no choice because now you have bills to pay and the only way you can feel better is instant gratification like sugar and alcohol and even drugs if its extremely bad because remember due to stress your in no state to get to the gym and cook for yourself and have a good time with your mates if your being overworked and underpaid and your stressed  give it a couple of years of this and you start to feel a huge sense of despair and anxiety because you feel like your in this horrible situation and you cant dont anything about it  you start reminiscing about the good times when you were at school college and you wonder what has changed youve started working  you seen you identity sense of excitement for life just completely stripped away but you cant complain because people have it worse off now ive been diagnosed with depression anxiety because of work  and they give you a little leaflet of natural ways to improve your mental health which is 'spend time in nature  'eat organic  'exercise 'be kind and social'  'look at the positive thing's  so i look around and see everybody spends daylight hours inside a building away from the sun and nature  most jobs are in front of a screen so there's no exercise  most jobs people dont enjoy and find stressful and so theres only a stressful enviroment community  then you think 'wait a minute  humans natural habitat is to be in nature and exercising and eat naturally from the earth  so why have we taken ourselves away from it all '  'why is suicide rate so high and so many people directly and indirectly deal with mental health problems in first world countries  why do we have billionaires in the world but people literally starving in other parts of the world  because the capitalistic system and the people at the top who are running it dont care about what is good for everyone  they only care for themselves  we have enough food to feed the whole world  the knowledge and technology for everyone to have access to electrical energy and a healthy habitat lifestyle  but people at the top and the people who are running this system dont care about that or us  i speak for myself and perhaps others in this group when i say im not willing to spend my life miserably contributing to this system that has brought so many of us to our knees  id rather spend my life doing everything i can to get rod of it because the sooner we do and replace it with a much more human friendly system  the sooner we will move forward in a positive direction as a species   now this year i have been living off universal credit and personal independence payments because i have suffered a huge mental breakdown this year which i think was covid related and my industry falling to pieces after spending 10 years in my industry building a career to get out of the 'rat race' as soon as possible  i ended up going into hospital for over 3 weeks because of it  so despite my views on this system i am also thankful for it supporting me whilst ive been in a bad place but i would also argue its the system that has put me in a bad place   im getting better and have started retraining in the health and fitness industry which overall is much better for both physical and mental health so i hope to one day get to a point where i actually enjoy doing what im doing day to day instead of just looking forward to that end goal which i dont believe anybody should be doing  should all be about living in the present  but hey  what do i know  apparently im mental lol i hope this helps people out there   ,pihjoh
4129,The Magic Hammer,long long ago in a land far far away there was a poor carpenter who worked tirelessly to provide for his family   every day he would hammer and cut and sand to create chairs and tables and toys for the people of his village   he was beloved by them   but they too were poor and could not pay him very well for his craft    amp x200b   one day he was cutting into a tree trunk when from it emerged a tiny winged woman   she chastised him for destroying her home   he looked into her eyes and took pity on her   by way of apology he promised to make her a new home better than before    amp x200b   he got to work  and set out as if to make this his masterpiece   after a full day's work of planing and cutting  sawing and drilling he presented her with a miniature house complete with a miniature bed alongside miniature table and chairs    amp x200b   she was happy with his gift and gladly accepted it   but was dismayed to see how long it took him to create   in return spoke some magic words to his hammer and was never seen again    amp x200b   from that day forth the carpenter could  with a single tap of the hammer  instantly turn a tree trunk into the most beautiful table or a sturdy door frame or a wooden carriage or anything he could imagine    amp x200b   the village prospered and the carpenter and his family lived happily ever after    amp x200b       amp x200b   one hundred years later  in that very same town jacob awoke as the church tower clock struck eight   just as the sun had already set behind the mountains he was breaking his fast with a bowl of rolled oats   he prepared his makeshift bed  which consisted of an uncomfortable mattress atop a haggard old dining table   he then tidied the house  for his brother would have to sleep and live there while he was away at work   later  as he entered the carpenters workshop he saw the usual ugly little lumps of wood   thousands upon thousands of them all as if soldiers in neat rank and file as far as his eyes could see   his brother wilhelm deflated after a grueling twelve hour shift handed jacob the magical hammer   the brothers made eye contact as they passed each other   but remained silent  for there was nothing to say   and with that jacob set to work    amp x200b   tap tap tap   getting into the rhythm  trying to maintain his target of one crafting every second   followed by his two supervisors ensuring he didn't fall behind his quota    amp x200b   he admired all of the beautiful creations appearing before his eyes   a door  a table  a wagon wheel  a bed frame   he wished he could afford a bed frame so ornate and sturdy   but saving for such a luxury would take months nay years    amp x200b   after his twelve hours of labour  with a trembling hand he passed the hammer back to his brother   on his way out of the workshop he passed the same hundred rows and hundred columns of wood except now they were not just lumps of wood but masterpieces    amp x200b   all of them to be transported to the man who possessed the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all goods made with the hammer   except of course for every single freshly crafted bed frame   these instead lay just outside the building in an untidy heap ready for collection   but the local merchant who had purchased them  lit the bedframes ablaze so as to maintain the value of the bed frames he already owned    amp x200b   jacob wished he could become such a merchant  but alas he did not have the education or training needed to know when to buy  when to sell and when to burn your stock in an open fire    amp x200b   the foreman handed him the day's wages  ninety copper pieces  ten shy of the hundred that had been agreed    you miss hit one of your hammer strikes  the bed frame turned out malformed  we cannot sell that   you're lucky we didn t deduct the full value of a bedframe   it would take you some time to pay back ten thousand copper pieces    a fair assessment  he thought   for the sheet of paper with his promised wage did include such a clause    amp x200b   no sooner had the money hit the palm of his hand than he had to give twenty pieces back to the woman standing beside the foreman   the representative of the king demanding subject each pay their tax to the crown   he resented the king taking his hard earned pittance    amp x200b   at this point he was feeling quite thirsty  so he made his way to the river   the river merchant  seated in a hut on the bank  offered to sell him a pitcher of water for fifty copper pieces   jacob begrudgingly accepted    curses  he thought   now i only have twenty copper pieces left   if i had not been mugged by the king this morning  i would be twice as rich    amp x200b   as he sipped his carefully rationed drink  he witnessed a vagabond stealing water from the river    fool  he said to himself   she shall regret stealing from the man who possesses the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all of the water that flows through this river    amp x200b   two men emerged from the river merchant's hut carrying with them each a great club   they beat the unkempt woman with their clubs until she could no longer stand    we are doing this for your own good  they said    you deprive me of water  for my own good  she responded  still under attack    what if the man who possesses the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all of the water that flows through this river decides to poison it    amp x200b   jacob watched these events unfold  feeling as though even if he had the inclination to stop justice being served he would be powerless to do so   he treated himself to another small mouthful of water  content in the knowledge that even if the river was poisoned his costly ration would be untainted    amp x200b   a representative from the crown appeared  and politely asked that they stop the beating   this man derided the vagabond for being a drain on the community  and called her a parasite   he purchased an extra small pitcher of water from the merchant and offered it to the woman   but before she could accept he told her in order to receive his generous gift she must first offer to make herself useful   she approached the merchant in the hut and asked if he would take on the employment of an extra goon   the merchant looked at her slight frame  and laughed at her and said he had no need of her services   with that the king's representative gave her the water    amp x200b    that is my money he is spending  jacob thought to himself    he is spending my money on that ungrateful parasite  and tomorrow as thanks she will be approaching my employer offering to undercut my wage    amp x200b   it was approaching noon  time for jacob to return home to bed and psychologically prepare himself for his next day's work   on his way he encountered a small girl who asked him what he did for a living   after he explained it  the child said to him   you must be very happy to be able to make so many things   i wish i was able to make so many things   if i could  i would make everything everyone needs and give it to them for free    amp x200b   jacob admitted that providing things for the people of the town would make him happy   but then he thought of the man who possessed the sheet of paper claiming ownership over all goods made with the hammer   it may take some convincing for him to allow jacob to simply give the fruits of his labour away free of charge   perhaps he could purchase the sheet of paper  he wondered how long it would take him to save such money    amp x200b   he felt a chill of unease creep up his spine   he tried to repress thoughts he ought not think   a memory flashed before his eyes of when he was a child perhaps the age of the girl in front of him   there were rumours of the farmer who wielded a magic sickle similar to his magic hammer   this farmer would give out food to all  king and beggar alike  with complete disregard for the wishes of the one possessing the sheet of paper claiming ownership over the food    amp x200b   he tried not to think on it but he knew how the story ended   how the paper owners rose up and settled their differences with the king  and together they put the farmer to death  along with his wife  and their small child   they put to death every farmer in his village  every farmer's wife  every innocent child   every house burnt to the ground   the village still in ruin and abandoned to this day    amp x200b   he swallowed a lump in his throat and said to her   take an advice   giving things away for free sounds good in your heart but it never works out in real life ,pihu4t

4132,High expectations have ruined work/life balance,after writing what i last wrote i m in the mood to get some more stuff out of me and point out more shit wrong with society  so you know who your managers and supervisors are always on your ass telling you to speed up  how companies like amazon expect you to be the lebron james of packing boxes  well i would like to just say that it s the managers just being assholes and wanting too much out of their employees  but i can t blame them entirely  unfortunately  yes they can be less of a dick head about it but it s not going to change the fact that high productivity is expected of us because of high expectations from customers  how many of you complain about being overworked but when you order something on amazon they expect that to be delivered within days or else they ll be pissed  then you go online and write your review saying the delivery needs to be faster  well guess how they make that happen for you  i ll let you think of that on your own  we need to live life like the saying  you can t rush art  do you ever show up to a fast food restaurant and expect a gourmet meal  in the gaming community we re finally starting to accept delays because we d rather the devs not be overworked and the game come out completed and polished  we need to apply that to everything  it s the only way we ll ever get closer to a better work life balance ,pi6r4b

4171,Quit my terrible job,i had a fairly unique field service job  driving around all over 3 counties in my state installing and servicing a product for homeowners  the work itself was actually enjoyable to me however we were basically expected to be available to work from 8am to 6pm at the very least not counting drive times to get to the first stop and home from the last which sometimes could be up to 2 hours away  this meant many days i d leave at 6am and get home at 8pm  i worked anywhere from 50-65 hours a week depending on how my service calls for that week lined up   we also were on this shitty rotation  where we worked monday thru friday  had sat  sun and the following monday off and then worked tuesday thru saturday with sunday off and back at it the next monday  every other week was a 3 day weekend with a 1 day in between  sounds okay on paper i guess but when working 60 hours a week guess what happens to the one day weekend  you re at home doing housework and not getting a rest    on top of that  more often than not we were under additional mandatory overtime where we had to pick one day from our 3 day weekend and work a full shift making it a 2 day in reality   the starting wage for this job isn t even enough for a single person to pay rent for a 1 bed apartment in this extremely expensive region   the company was and still is also very short handed making the already long hours even worse trying to pack in as much work as possible to pick up the slack of missing four technicians  even when we were fully staffed it was still usually 60 hours a week    roughly six months ago my idiot general manager asked how i was doing and i was honest  i told her that the hours were too much  unsustainable and abusive    she attempted to placate me by telling me my 5-6 pm appointment slot was blocked out and had always been blocked out  which was a lie or didn t stop scheduling from putting things there  and that she wouldn t make me give up one of my days on the 3 day  which she did but i somehow still ended up working just as many hours over less days  she also offered a  sales position when so-and-so salesperson was promoted to national sales  which is something i wanted but there was no time frame   about 2 months ago i was contacted by a company that does something completely different  but another field service sort of thing    by this time i am completely disgruntled just holding on because i don t want to leave a job with nothing lined up  i ve already mentally checked out of this job and just doing the bare minimum  i start finding out about the new company and job i was just contacted about   i am at a particularly complex install that was scheduled from 8am to 5pm and miraculously have nothing on my schedule after it  i saw this the night before and made rare social dinner plans   i was finishing up about an hour early  not that anyone knew this because we work solo  when i was trying to switch inventory from my truck to the customers account and the phone app we use for this is malfunctioning so i restart it and that s when i see a service call had been put on my schedule per the gm   i m totally pissed now as it means i have to cancel dinner  i sent her a text asking if we were expected just to not have any life outside of work on days we are scheduled   she calls me and by this point i m just done and i tell her that i don t know why i bother to continue coming to work  i don t need to be there and i could easily move on  she tells me i am a great technician and she would hate to see me leave  she asks what she can do   i tell her i need a mental day to which she demands a doctors note  easy enough  two different therapists have been telling me to quit this job for months    about a month goes by and i have an offer with a significant pay increase on the table    i waffled back and forth on quitting on the spot or giving two weeks because that s what i ve been brainwashed to do  and in the end i decided to give one week  seemed like an okay compromise between my mental well being and giving my coworkers a little time to prepare for the shit they will be eating in my absence   i gave notice saying that my last day was the next friday  which was only 4 work days because i gave notice on the friday before my 3 days off   the general manager is furious  she is getting tears in her eyes and shaking with anger   it d be nice if you gave me two weeks  to which i reply that i have to do what s best for me and one week is the best i will do  i could be done right now with no notice    she then got even more mad and said  well i don t think we could work with you in the future anyway  while making fists and shaking even more    lolwat  not a month ago you said i was a great technician and you would hate to see me leave    i ended up working 60 hours in those last 4 days so my coworkers do not have to pick up appointments those days because i blew them off ,pidvet
4172,Money won’t fix anything,the worst part about working are the people you work with and the lack of work life balance  people complain about a living wage or just the lack of payment for what s expected of you  but fail to realize that is the least of your worries  do you really think that just because you ll be paid more that your supervisors will respect you more  or since you get paid more you won t be expected to do more work  and most important of all  if minimum wage goes up  prices go up  you think the big wigs of these companies are going to be ok with some of their salary going towards their pawns  hell no  they re going to find a way to make all that back whether that s putting less money into their company  making it worse for their employees  or they ll just raise the prices of their products and services  the only real way we ll ever see a change would be to change out who s running the damn operation  we ve allowed selfishness to be one of the most rewarding characteristics for centuries honestly  these founders and managers care about their wallets and their families  that s it  i get wanting anything and everything for your kids  but your kid having a fucking bmw for their first car is completely ridiculous  before i ramble on about this let me just get to the point  everyone depressed about work  money is not going to help  think about it  even if you re able to afford nice things go out more  when would you have time to do it if all you ever have are two days to yourself every week ,pi6gpl

4195,My big fish story back from when I believed hard work is rewarded.,this was back in 2015  my life seemed to be getting on track  and i was working what i thought was a great job at the time  the best job i ever had even - i thought my contributions were appreciated and would be reciprocated in due time  my coworkers liked me  nobody complained when i showed up late or took a day off and i made relatively decent money  but to the upper echelon of management i just a lowly software developer who sharpened pencils and made sure that nothing caught on fire   as in actual fires  at one point i realized they were running over 20 mac pros on a dozen  10 surge protectors bought off amazon  all of which were plugged into each other because they didn't have enough outlets  i got permission to replace them  went to home depot  and bought five properly rated domestically manufactured surge protectors  it took months to get reimbursed   at some point i discovered absolutely nobody was maintaining proper backups of our databases  and what basic differential backups did exist were stored on the server running the goddamned database  if one of our developers went rogue or we got hacked at any point we would probably go out of business    so i set up my workstation to do regularly scheduled backups and store them locally  but i had nowhere near enough space to store all of the user files  and even the database required juggling files around  i let management know and explained that i needed a few terabytes worth of storage to back up all of our data properly    the disks i had requested totaled about  800 including the raid controllers so that i could do on-site backups  and then another few hundred a year annually to set up an offsite backup on a different amazon account that only the executive team would have access to   instead of just doing what i had asked they decided to hire a dedicated  head of devops  to ensure that everything was done properly  he worked in one of amazon's data centers  so he was a real professional unlike me   his first heroic deed was purchasing an incredibly expensive  enormous  gt 1000 wheeled server enclosure intended for use in a data center rather than an open office  he then put two whole switches  router  and a modem inside of it and used the rest to store some ethernet cables  he then had to take the router out of it after realizing that putting wifi and metal cages do not mix   i had just rewired the network month earlier after receiving complaints from some of the service team that our internet was 'really slow'  for some reason that still puzzles me to this very day he replaced those switches  which were brand new 10gb s cisco  with a dozen smaller 10 100mb s switches he saw for sale on slickdeals    he then daisy chained those together throughout the office and got rid of the cisco equipment   which was the exact same setup we had before  suddenly the network got a whole lot slower and nobody could figure out why    after this  having nothing to do  he spent most of his time adding features to a slack bot so my coworkers could play disco music on a very loud bluetooth speaker while i programmed   dancing queen  feel the beat from the tambourine  oh yeah  instead of uh  doing the only job he was hired for  maintaining our fucking backups   which i was still doing because nobody else was   i found out that our customers were being phished after we hired more than a few offshore developers that i was tasked with getting up to speed   don't worry  we're definitely keeping you  they're here to help your workload  we were a 30 or 40 person company in a niche industry so i brought it to the attention of the ceo because i had no idea who was behind it   later that evening i was pinged in our public slack  general channel by our hero who informed me i was disrespecting him and that he was the head of devops  so all security related issues must go through him directly  i responded that i'm the  director of office-dog relations  and that the office dog had given me permission to do so  this did not go over well and my messages were deleted apparently he had been given admin access to slack for his spotify bot  and i was told by management to stop pissing people off   shortly after that one of our new very experienced offshore developers accidently deleted our payment gateway on a friday evening  apparently our head of devops gave them the root aws account logins  nobody could figure out how to deploy a fresh copy to it  so i got to spend my a decent chunk of my friday evening doing just that   then the following monday morning  on april fools 2016  i came in and realized that my slack privileges were revoked  my username was renamed to  disabled  and my github access was gone    i sat around for about an hour until i got pulled into our conference room  i was thanked for my service and told the company was growing and changing  they took my keys and escorted me out of the building as if i was going to go on some rampage  the office manager  who owned the office dog  later got a taxi and brought it to my apartment    of course i received zero severance and zero notice  i later learned that the new developers released the update i had finished a week before being fired  which gained them much praise for how happy customers were with how much faster the application ran  the office manager was fired after trying to take pregnancy leave and i was invited to come visit the former office dog   later on  from a different colleague  i heard about how they got hit by ransomware  of course had no backups  and all of this was  somehow  my fault  they had to lay off about half the company after that incident  naturally the director-of-doing-backups remained employed despite being responsible for it   at some point during this shit-hurricane i overheard someone from accounting gossip about the  rockstar  from amazon - who was making 150k a year  i made 60k  never been the same since ,phl07o

4206,How can we live comfortably without working,in this shitty capitalist hellscape  does anyone have any idea on how one would live without working and without being born rich    i live in london  united kingdom  the rent is extortionately high if you want to live in any degree of comfort  so obviously i'd need to move out of the city as a start    but paying rent would still require some form of income  i could work a few days a month and maybe get by   housing prices are something like 28 times the yearly wage  unlike 20 years ago when it was like 3 times the yearly wage  so buying is not really an option   the social system here has been decimated by the tory party  it is possible to barely survive  but not live  and not in anything more than a house share or a bin   im only 19 but the concept of working for the rest of my life is driving me further to suicide than i have ever been before   a combination of my distain for capitalism and my severe depression and anxiety makes it very difficult for me to see any light at the end of the tunnel or point in continuing to exist   i don't want to have to work for someone else who won't even pay me enough to rent a decent place for the rest of my life  i'm currently only on 18k  to afford rent here you need 35k at minimum   i would like to dive more into my political activism to try and change this for us all but i was already apathetic before starting work  and now im so drained each day i don't have the energy to fight  i suppose that's the whole point   i realize that everyone here is probably in the same position  but if anyone has some survival tips i'll be happy to hear them ,phpwnf

4238,The Illusion of Higher Wages,be skeptical when you see a  news article  in the press about a company announcing it s going to be paying higher wages  it s usually total bullshit and journalists are such assholes anymore-just looking for click bait inflammatory political angles-that they print it without question    case in point- a large national bank has made headlines twice in two years by telling the press  our lowest paid employee will be paid x  headlines from cnn read  x lifting wages  company gets lots of positive press  avoids being target of cancel culture etc    reality-  company isn t raising wages  they are eliminating the lowest paid employee position  in the case of the bank  they eliminated the teller position-their lowest paid employees  some tellers were given other jobs  some promoted others just left to rot until they quit  offering severance too expensive  older workers were targeted as being  don t place on career path-let them rot  and replaced with people in their 20 s because their health care costs are lower    the next year the bank eliminated the third tier-relationship managers and assistant managers  everyone had to be promoted or quit out of frustration of waiting for promotions  their bonus structure was put on hold  first one quarter  then another  eventually it had been a year and a half and people realized their bonuses were never coming back   what was left was a smaller number of positions at the second tier level who were at the same pay they always were but now doing the work of 4 people-tellers  bankers  outbound call center worker and assistant manager  the higher bonuses paid to third tier employees were eliminated along with their position  company wasn t paying more in wages-they were paying less  making people do more and erasing their career path    you ll be able to recognize these banks  they ll have one teller if any these days  you ll have to wait for a banker to come out of an office to help you  the reality is these banks don t want your transactions  they want to make it as hard as possible for you to visit a branch and get service  they charge you for on line transactions that are supposed to take place of tellers  their technology usually sucks-atms always broken  calling them incurs an hour wait    they get away with it because banking is sticky  even during the  08 recession people were reluctant to take part in the  move your money  movement  they get you as students and then you stay with them for life long after the free student account benefits are gone    all i can say is move your money  join a credit union  get rid of  3 fees to transfer money   60 boxes of checks   15 cashiers checks  and when you see the companies seeking fame for raising wages  recognize it is 100  bullshit ,phwuuz

4242,What's the best way to deal with a garbage boss/management,i'll try to keep this short but recently we got a new supervisor at my job  i work at a heavy truck shop for a very large company  we just got this guy that they transferred from another shop in our same city  the reason this is done is because they don't want the supervisor to have  favorites  which is pretty stupid because if i work in one location why would i want to be transferred  not the point tho    we've had multiple supervisors since they don't really last except for the one on the morning shift  the last 2 supervisors we had were pretty great guys  they used to be technicians and knew what we went through and obviously understood what we did  this guy is not like that  a complete asshole  he's been here for a month and a half and he's tried to yell at every tech for no reason and argue with everyone  no one really likes him and recently he got into an argument with one of the older techs  reason being because the older tech sent an email to the district manager about him cussing and insulting one of the new guys for doing a mistake  after the email was sent the supervisor and branch manager pulled him into the office and ended giving the old tech a write up saying that he started conflict and wasn't being subordinate  seriously  like our supervisor is the one causing all the issues and this toxic environment   i've already made my decision to find a new job early next year but what could i do about the situation right now because he's also tried to give me trouble for no reason at all and i really don't want to deal with it  i've already told our boss but she doesn't care since this new supervisor does the job that she doesn't want to handle  i told the old guy to message hr but not entirely sure if that will work because what i've heard from other guys they're not of much help  not sure what our district manager will do about it or more than likely he won't do anything   tldr  supervisor a bitch   our boss doesn't do anything about him since he does her job  they give us write ups even though he causes conflict and creates a toxic environment,phh18q

Why is this not the standard everywhere?,  translation to english    trade union cnv wants 30-hour working week the trade union cnv will focus on a shorter working week of 30 hours in collective bargaining in the coming period  research by the union shows that 1 in 5 people suffer from burnout  working less should  among other things  prevent psychological problems  according to cnv chairman piet fortuin  according to him  it is high time for a 'new balance'  because the number of people suffering from burnout has increased due to the corona crisis      hundreds of thousands of people are through it  said fortuin  earlier research by the union in may this year shows that the number of people suffering from burnout complaints has risen from 11 percent to 21 percent since the start of the corona crisis  more than half of those surveyed think that a 30-hour work week reduces the number of burnouts  two-thirds expect less absenteeism and 73 percent foresee a better work-life balance     cnv calls it a 'logical moment' to switch to a four-day work week  now that the economy is picking up again after the corona pandemic  fortuin   the corona crisis teaches us that we can switch faster than we thought  within a day millions of dutch people were working from home  one and a half years ago  moreover  according to the union  it appears that people are happier because of a shorter working week   various tests at companies show that people are happier  more efficient and more productive  iceland is leading the way in this  it would be great if dutch companies follow suit ,phmoig

4277,Underpaid,i recently quit my job in the medical field  i'm a tech not a nurse of doc  and i came to the realization the people in the medical field are criminally underpaid at least in the us where private ownership of hospitals and clinics is the norm    for all the lipservice of healthcare workers being  heroes  and  essential  it doesn't feel like we are compensated for that  i compare my pay with those of friends and people i know who work in something like computer science or engineering  i am not saying it is bad these people can easily make 6 figures and work from home  but shouldn't a good society prioritize the  heroes    but that is not what happens  you go to school and get in debt then get a job that is slightly better pay than what you can get without a degree certification  but it is not enough for the amount of skill and work required    i am not trying to ride a high horse  because even the people who work in service or manual labor are also underpaid  but i have to ask what is the point of me doing my best to help people if i am just barely getting by financially when people who do nothing to help society except increasing a company's stock price get to live like kings  i just have no motivation anymore  i love the medical field and all the interesting stuff i have learned  but it is not worth it   another thing that highlights the comedy of my situation is that i bought an nft with crypto currency for relatively cheap and ended up selling it for almost 2 months of wages  there is something very wrong with this society and everyone who isn't a company owner or executive is basically a slave ,phu44j

life so long as i take medication  i get free healthcare and dental from the va   i live in rural west georgia  us  which plays a significant part in keeping my expenses low    as a disclaimer  my husband just started a part-time job  but we spent all of the previous 12 months without working    i currently have the view that working is exploitative  repressive  unnecessary  and should be something we seek to abandon  i'm not here to argue about my beliefs  i just want to give people an idea of how my life has changed since i started receiving what is essentially ubi  universal basic income    amp x200b   i grew up poor  sometimes living in nice houses  other times living in trailer parks  and i spent my senior year of high school homeless  my father worked a lot of manual labor jobs like construction and hvac just like his father before him and my younger brother after him  work was drilled into our heads from a young age because it is what we would have to depend on to survive for the rest of our lives   i joined the military to escape that sort of life  i was above average in school and had excellent grades  but college wasn't an option for me due to my family's financial situation  during my time in the military  i got to experience life outside of my small town  which helped open my eyes to a lot of things  i used to be racist  homophobic  and interested in fascism  while military life is quite different from normal working life  the principal was the same  you wake up  put on your work clothes  work a full day  and go home to get ready for the next one  we got weekends and christmas off  the main difference was that we were provided food and shelter  even if we didn't live in the barracks  we also had free healthcare  which included dental  it was hard at times  but that mentality was always there like a little voice telling me to work harder and grind to pass barriers and get promotions    then i got sick and received a medical discharge along with my 100  rating  i started receiving my payments 1 month after i returned home  i took my diagnosis and discharge really hard and fell into a deep depression which i am still struggling with today  i still experience all of the negatives that some people blame on having to work  like stress  anxiety  and depression  they just come from different places  we still sometimes struggle with bills if an unexpected expense comes up  but for the most part we make it by without having to worry about having money    amp x200b   i used to think life was just work  we went through school to prepare us for working life  and we were expected to take what we learned and continue working until we either couldn't or could afford not to  i believed that was a good system  and that in exchange for providing our labor  we could live comfortable lives  even before i started receiving my disability  i started having doubts about the current way we do things  i watched my father break his body to try and provide for our family  and we still lived in poverty  the system wasn't as black and white as i once thought  but i didn't really understand that until i could look at it from the outside instead of from within   i don't think anyone can argue that most wage-earners aren't being exploited for their labor  for example  during the pandemic  a company like kroger made record profits while their workers experienced some of the worst working conditions in recent history  to repay their workers for their sacrifices  kroger paid a small bonus for a few weeks  then raised their minimum starting pay to  12 an hour  i watched as my friends started to get sick with covid  but were forced to go into work to bend over backwards for people that didn't care enough about them to wear a mask  when i speak to those friends about how they can make their situations better  the response is usually  there's nothing i can do  they were already poor from the low-wages and hours  adding the rent increases and the end of the eviction moratorium just made things worse  their company didn't develop the virus  but they profited at their workers' expense  and purposefully keep them in a stage of low-wage work dependence that is hard to escape  if i knew i either had to accept that agreement or starve  i would want to find a way to dismantle that relationship in any way possible  but most people i talk to will stand up for the company  excuse their behavior  or acknowledge and accept that reality without wanting to change it  depending on the thing that is taking advantage of you gives you a sort of stockholm syndrome that i feel a lot of people either don't notice or don't acknowledge      amp x200b    amp x200b   i spent the first few years without having to work doing nothing  i sat around  played video games  cooked some decent food  went on a long trip or two  but for the most part i just existed  right before the pandemic  i got bored and worked for the census temporarily  i can say that i enjoyed the work i did  which consisted of locating homeless encampments and training door-knockers  but when it was over  i wasn't keen on trying to find another job  the census job had just enough freedom and flexibility that it almost didn't seem like work  and i wouldn't be able to find that environment outside of that unique situation   i started to learn more about politics  as i said  i was pretty right wing in my youth  when george floyd was murdered  i was sort of woken up a bit  i started to see things that were once hidden to me  and my veil of ignorance started to lift  i don't necessarily attribute that to not having to work  but not having a job to take up a large portion of my time  i spent that time educating myself  i spent hours reading about anything and everything  from bronte to kropotkin  i watched videos and read articles from those in the black community  and started to actually listen to black voices for the first time in my life  i went from denying my privilege to acknowledging it and actually wanting to use it to help make a difference for those that suffered at its expense    i picked up a guitar again for the first time in years  and used my time to practice   i took up painting  which is something i never considered before  but i am starting to fall in love with   i taught myself how to crochet  and even made some small projects   i was given an opportunity to reflect on my life and the world   i was able to improve my relationship with my husband   i spent a lot of time training and enjoying time with my dogs   i had the freedom to work on my mental health   i had the time to cultivate meaningful relationships and repair previously broken relationships   i learned to value things other than valuable things  which was a difficult concept for me   i did all of those things and more without worrying about how my bills would be paid  or whether or not i could afford to get sick  my time was spent how i wanted it to be spent  and not on what was required for my survival or for the profit of others  i feel like i have been able to live my life more fully and freely than if i had to work  which is poetic considering that we are told work will lead to a fulfilling life   i'll try to answer any questions ,ph1gaz
4415,How my employer tried to steal my furlough pay,i ve read a fair amount of stories hateful managers and companies here so i thought i d like to share mine too   i worked at a small  family-team  restaurant in the uk after the first lockdown  i had never been a waitress before and i was interested the industry  it was hard work   40 h week  split shift  but i liked the team and how much i was learning  coworkers complained about salary and holidays  the service fee was for the company  in the uk it s for the staff  but not in my country so i didn t noticed  and holidays were fewer than supposed  i didn t care bc i wasn t planning to stay for long    i was put in furlough  80  salary  during the 3rd lockdown  december  then the manager told me that after january i d get only the amount of furlough the the govt gave her for me  turns out that they were paying me a third of my wages under the table without telling me and then had been topping up my furlough out of their pocket  they got tired of it and decided to let me rot with barely enough to pay rent  they even had the balls to ask me to tell them if i get a second job  because then the govt had to reduce my furlough allowance  which i knew was total bs   i didn t knew my actual salary until then bc i had never been given a payslip  i had the feeling i d get into trouble if i asked so i didn t  i was so angry and mad  i decided to return to my country  like everyone did  where life s cheap and don t need to pay rent  enjoy my furlough and probably never come back  i told management i d be back after lockdown  she was so angry we all left without telling before her that she took days off our holidays   i enjoyed 4-5 holiday-like months in spain  hiking with my family  visited local villages with my bf  improved my cv  decided i d stay there  took interviews  i bought a 15pounds flight in case they wanted proof of my return and waited until the very last payday  the day before my departure  to tell them i wouldn t come back due to an ill relative  partly true  i wasn t 100  honest cause i couldn t bother to argue  still it was 13 days notice   the manager phoned me 6 times and sent me angry 2 minute-long audios demanding me to return  she then proceed to extort me during several days  she basically said  you scammed the govt so give me your furlough money so i can return it or i ll get my accountants to report you for that and for non-essential travel during lockdown and you ll go to court whenever you come back to the uk  i asked her for my end-of-employment documents so i could clear my taxes in the uk and she said not until you give me the money  i called hmrc  labour dept  and they were shocked  they insisted that my furlough pay was for me and that i was free to quit my job regardless  that their extortion and not reporting my resignation asap would lead to an investigation  because they were still getting paid for my furlough  i reported this all back to them and got it all fixed  they just got like 1 week of pay   because i was still in uni and younger than them  they thought that was one of my first jobs and that they could play with me however they wanted  when actually i just took longer to finish uni bc i had to work and put up with a lot of shit before them  i purposely removed a lot of my background from my resume so i could get a short-term gig  however  this was the final kick i needed to realise that bosses give a shit about you  al the  we take care of our employees  is all bs    now i m a freelancer  i agreed to work on a project with a local business before quitting that job  have been getting more clients since then  i couldn t have made it without that furlough money tho  i still work as hell but i love my job  i make more money and it all goes to my pocket  even needed to find a partner to split work  on my own schedule  from home and with my cat napping next to me    tldr  family-team company tried to steal my furlough money jealous that i had been enjoying holidays out of it and then quit ,ph67q3

How much is an hour of a human’s time worth?,so minimum wage where i live is  8 91 12 31  per hour  not enough to live on in my opinion  and definitely not enough to actively save for large payments like cars or houses   if someone came up to me in the street and said  i m gonna give you  8 91 to walk up and down this street for an hour  i d go  no way  i have better things to do with my time  and leave  so why should we do things that are harder than walking up and down a street for an hour for that level of money when our time is clearly so much more precious than that    what i m curious to know is what monetary value would you put on an hour of your time for that menial task  what amount of money would it take for you to walk up and down that street knowing it s a finite human resource  a moment of your life that you can never get back  how much is that worth ,ph5dfp

4460,A question about unpaid trial shifts,so i work as a supervisor at a a great restaurant   amazing managers  hard work is recognized and compensated  it's overall a great place to work   i've seen posts smashing unpaid trial shifts here  but i feel like having someone come in for a few hours to  work   mostly just so they can see if its a good fit for them and for us to see if their resume is accurate like they have basic knife skills etc  and buying them dinner and a drink after can be helpful for both sides   would this community still consider it unethical to be unpaid  if not then why  thanks for any replies ,pgjtn8

4474,The day I decided to quit, inspired by the  sorry i'm late i sat on my bed in a towel for 34 mins staring at the wall  post   so i was hired in march 2020 right as everything went into lockdown  my main responsibility at this job was field work collecting data points with a survey-grade gps of storm sewers manholes etc with the end goal being a digital  interactive map application that city employees would use to hopefully make their jobs easier  yes  i went to school for this - b s  in geography  this  of course required travel which was not allowed during lockdown so we were all just doing pretty repetitive tasks from home during this time  when the travel ban lifted  pure insanity ensued  i found myself driving 2 5 - 4hrs hours each way to some remote town to collect data for weeks at time  picking up other people's projects that had fallen behind etc all while technically being a new hire in training still  i didn't mind  i felt like i was really helping and doing a good thing  well  this didn't last long as after about 3 months of this i was more burnt than karen on her tanning bed    fast forward another month or so and the data collection slows down as it's getting colder  it's just office work mainly and i start coming in later and staying later  still getting all of my work done  as this seemed to be the only way to combat the burnout  we were still having our bi weekly zoom meeting  that for some reason we were required to be at the office for and i was not as i was already boiling with stress and thought this rule was ridiculous  so i would attend these meetings and then take about 30-45 minutes at my apartment to gather myself before going in  one day upon arriving at the office i'm yanked into my supervisor's office with my other supervisor present and they proceed to grill me which i still feel like i deserved  the thing that threw me off was not one bit of concern for what i may have been going through mentally and just all about how bad i'm making them look  then  my female supervisor makes a rather strange comment that  she'd be very disappointed if she found out her son was doing what i was doing  ah okay i see  fuck that  that comment still gives me weird feelings to this day  of course i get the whole  we're like a family here  rant as well  i had enough  there was no way i could continue this job with any dignity after that  i knew i messed up but that situation was too much    i worked for about 3 more months to get through a few more months of my lease and i was gone  i hope this is at least an entertaining read for you all  i know i messed up and i don't wish to gain any sympathy here but just a personal account of being burnt out trying to impress your employer   take care  and don't work so hard ,pglhxe

4476,New manager at big defense contractor trying to screw me over,i work at one of the big three defense contractors in the us  lockheed  northrop grumman  etc    the company s policy is that with 5 years of experience and a bachelor s degree you are eligible to be promoted from  engineer  to  principal engineer   i have worked at this company for almost 5 years now with september 6th being the mark of 5 years  i should be eligible for promotion based on these criteria alone   the kicker is that i recently transferred from one group within the company into another  so my manager changed  i spoke with my new manager about promotion and was told that i don t have 5 years of experience in this particular group so i d have to prove myself capable of operating at that level before i would be eligible for promotion    i spoke with my old manager in my previous group and was told they d happily take me back and put me in for promotion if i did    basically it is boiling down to the fact that the new manager wants me but wants to pay me less than i deserve and reprove myself as an employee in their group ,pgl3i2
4477,Boss finally changing inefficient processes after two years of me complaining.... but only because I'm leaving to go elsewhere,to say i am beyond frustrated is an understatement  i have been in my current quite high up position for over 4 years  half of that time has been spent going around a merry go round with two higher ups complaining about how inefficient processes have been and that they're making my job a lot harder and more stressful than it needs to be  finally got to a boiling point last month when i was shouted at for not doing enough  despite working through the entire pandemic period  doing 3 people's jobs and being severely underpaid  so i applied elsewhere on a drunken whim and after 2 weeks of interviewing landed my dream job with a 55  wage increase   then i told work i was leaving  so of course my boss has finally decided my job is too much of a hassle for a new person to deal with so is finally changing the processes i have been practically begging them to change for the last 2 years  i feel like screaming because i have wanted this change for so long  and have felt so unheard and washed aside for that whole time  only for them to start making the change because of some unknown person who we don't know  and they'll undoubtedly pay them a lot more than what i was on anyway   the only consolation i have is that me quitting was a shock  as was my turning down their  generous  counteroffer - which was only 5k pay rise that i would get  after  i put in all the work to change my job to become what my new job had already offered me  everyone at work has been saying how much they'll miss me and how stupid work have been and that they're proud of me for bettering myself   i still can't help but feel sad and angry though  it's a stupid little thought but it does make me feel like i wasn't good enough for them to make things better  but that just reinforces my decision to leave this place and go somewhere else   sorry for the rant  there's been many a time i've openly sobbed at my desk in work because of how stressful this place has been  and i hope this is the very last time  or one of the very last times this toxic place will make me feel sad or tiny  fuck my boss ,pglsxb

4497,Here's my story,hey guys  so i figured i'd share what lead me to get here   from when i was 14 i worked part time in retail hell  for years i struggled to do anything   fell for the scam that is the american college education pyramid scheme  and landed a hefty sum of debt   despite this still couldn't do much besides retail  that is until i landed my first office job   i was a customer service rep still  but it was in a proper office  with a set schedule   i remember sitting in my car thinking about having a real schedule for the first time in my life in over a decade   it blew my mind    amp x200b   i spent 5 years with that company  by year 2 i wanted to kill myself  i spent 40 hours a week being abused on the phones  i worked in billing for business services for a major cable company   you can imagine i'm sure but right before i was about to quit  they gave me a new position   i worked off the phones  i did nothing but paperwork  and i was good at it   my reviews were all perfect  literally 5 5 but disaster struck when they made the decision to put my team on the phones   i told them i couldn't go back to that   i needed to be off the phones   my manager  her boss  everyone told me i was perfect for a job as an analyst   had an interview with hr and the guy loved me  said i had to meet the manager of that team etc  etc   i reached out he set me up with another hr interview  no idea why  but fine   woman emailed me set up a time  i called her at the appropriate time   she had no idea who i was  she was eating lunch  told me i had no right to apply because i had no experience  literally a monkey could do the job they needed and my time with the company  skill set  and knowledge was more than enough  she made me feel like crap and told me to fuck off basically     amp x200b   next i tried to apply for an it role  i love computers  and i wanted to do that more anyway   i knew a guy who was leaving it to become a firefighter  so i applied  literally no response   i stayed on til they forced us on the phones  and tendered my resignation that day   ironically i got a job doing it for another company    amp x200b   i arrived at my new it job ready to kick some ass  i was excited to learn about the trade  use my skills for good   they were a nonprofit for autism   except this woman had no idea what it meant   she wanted me to go ahead and design a pamphlet for her to sell a property   i told her i wasn't a graphic designer  never touched the program before   i was here to help with technology issues etc   she then told me to get her coffee   i said ok  and left   never came back   the literal next day i got hired at a job  at a major finance company in it   this place was  man it was awesome  i could have stayed forever  but the problem was they didn't pay enough  and they didn't hire me full time  i was a contractor  so every 6 months i may not have a job  no insurance  no pto   i was burnt out in 9 months   i made it about a year before i left   turns out they never convert temps to full time   i worked with a guy who was there for 10 years  still a temp    amp x200b   i found a job after a while and tendered a resignation with the temp gig   finally  full time it work with benefits woo   except it sucked   they didn't train me  assumed i knew everything  and their ticketing system was just outlook   literally users emailed me directly   it was hell because my average ticket just said    error  or some people didn't know the subject line was not the place for their full message  god it's a nightmare and i could list a thousand horror stories easy  but this is already long enough   they also abused the  on-call  system  basically i had to continue my work day to 24 7 because they didn't understand an sla  and no one could tell these people no   it was absurd  but i'd get emails at all hours of the day  and if i didn't answer them it was a strike against me   covid hit about 4 months after i started there  we went home  it was great   i made a ton of money and didn't have to leave my house but on call still sucked   regardless this company failed upwards  and stumbled into 300  profits that year   mortgage company   my reward   as of june this year i was laid off    amp x200b   i called my buddy because i was terrified  i just bought a house  and now i thought it was all over   luckily  my old temp gig was desperate  they hired me on as a temp again  soooo i'm back where i started  but at least they're paying me more now   i still feel like i could go on  but i know most people won't want to read all of this   i just had to get it off my chest   fingers crossed that with all the crazy changes in this current company they'll at least hire me full time if not i'll look for new work again in one year  and when i leave i'll report the mistreatment to the local news or something   try to help at least one person on my way out ya know ,pgimgg

4553,Are anti-work “masters” possible?,   robert greene  doesn t seem able to either  though he does decry careerists and people who just want to climb the ladder  he also peppers the book with throwaway but sad statements like this one regarding barriers to learning    amp x200b    gt children are free from these handicaps because they depend on others and feel inferior  that feeling gives them a hunger to learn    amp x200b   basically  the same feelings of inferiority that drive my workaholism  not to mention prop up this entire shitty system  drive the  joy  of learning   it does seem like greene has a more nuanced view of things  and though he never says so explicitly  he implies that masters can learn to love learning without those feelings  interestingly  he describes mastery as  the return of child-like spontaneity   you get the playful mindset of a child  but  hopefully  in a situation where you re not longer fearful or dependent or  inferior  that s my reading of it anyway     the question that s been driving me crazy remains  can one strive for mastery in an anti-work way basically  for the sheer fun of it  is anyone considered a  master  in their field not a work-humper in some capacity   basically  is wanting mastery at all a sure sign that one hasn t escaped work-worship culture   i feel in my bones that mastery has simply been co-opted by work-humpers  that in essence it s separate from their philosophy and can exist in an anti-work world   but i m finding the two so hard to disentangle ,pga0jo
4554,Being loyal to your job gets you nowhere,of course this depends on your job  but generally  you're completely replaceable   i've worked a retail job for three years  did morning shifts before going to school  waking up at 5 6 am on a school day  did extra shifts no one else wanted to do  such as working hours in the freezer area without gloves  always stayed polite to the floor managers and obeyed their orders  when they'd ask  i'd work overtime  i called sick maybe 4 days a year   what did i get in return  my overtime was usually not even paid because they forgot to write it down  i wasn't allowed to take a two week holiday in winter  despite always working during the other holidays  i've been made fun of by managers and i got treated like i was a nuisance when they were in a bad mood  i wasn't considered a colleague  rather someone who did their dirty work  even on my last day at my job  the manager yelled i had slept the longest of everyone and that i had to work faster to make up for it  i started at 8 am rather than 7 am  no one said goodbye  no one said thank you either   all loyalty got me was extra workload  should've quit way earlier  it gets you nowhere ,pgdc5j

4582,How to Succeed?,as a disclaimer i consider myself a socialist  i see the current economic and work system as broken  prioritizing profits over people's well being and being completely destructive to ones mental health   but unfortunately we do not yet live in a socialist society  but a capitalist one  so if we want to eat  provide for our families  afford our hobbies etc  we need to find a way to achieve those goals in the capitalist system   given that what your peoples advice be for finding success a way to achieve these goals  a means that is possible in the world as it currently exists  and one that does not require a person to become a wage slave or sacrifice their mental health ,pg0i3l

4599,Just some ramblings I wrote at 5 AM (I work at 7),for context i am a 21 year old who works at target as a cart pusher  i've worked there for only 3 weeks   i just wanted to say that i literally do not take care of myself when i have a job  my life is literally slowly falling apart as i continue to grind out miserable shift after miserable shift and lose more and more of myself in the process the small part of me that wants to work out  play music  draw  decorate my room  eat healthy  make friends  and just try to be happy in general has been repeatedly smashed down as i do the same thing over and over and wake up feeling like crap every single day  is it really worth it to lose myself  to literally become a shell of a human being with no likes or aspirations at all  for  15 hr  i don't think so  i don't feel like myself  i feel like a robot doing the motions and being miserable the entire time  this is not sustainable  i will quit soon and hopefully start to regain my desire to live and my humanity  because the real me  he cares about those things  he has a desire to do better  he has hope for a happy life  the person i am right now just hopes he crashes on the way to work every single day and has trouble sleeping because he's dreading the next hellish day every single night  he gets off a shift and goes and buys junk food because he just wants anything to feel better after being miserable for so long  he doesn't work out because he's already exhausted  and he literally doesn't care if he gets fat  he throws his clothes on the floor and literally doesn't care what his room looks like  i'm barely ever there anyway  why would i care  why would any of those things matter when i am at target more than my own home  when less than 30  of my day is in my own control  target literally has more say over my own life than i do  and you know what they use it for  to make sure that people have carts so that they can buy more useless things  so that target will make more billions of dollars  i'm so fucking glad that's what my life is dedicated to  not  the last 3 weeks of my life has literally felt like 3 months  each day has been a marathon  i'm starting to feel disconnected from my family and friends because none of them understand why i feel this way  i genuinely have a hard time empathizing with someone who thinks this is good   i love my family  but they really just don't understand just how much this wrecks me  they think that if i do a different job  it will help  they tell me to try a different job  or just keep working at it  not realizing that i have literally thought about killing myself every single day for the past 3 weeks  i can barely remember anything i've done other than work repeatedly  and yet my family tells me they're happy i'm sticking with it and working a job  why would you be happy that i am destroying my own life slowly for money  i am literally selling my humanity and my desire to live for money  that's not a good thing  they work  and not only are they fine with it  they are happy  i will never be happy if somebody else controls my life  it doesn't matter what i am doing  if it's not under my own control  i want no part in it  and working literally makes me lose my spark  my desire to live and try new things and be better  a life spent working for someone else is not a life worth living  i would like control over my own life back   it feels like a very normal  human  natural desire to want control over your own life  so why am i so alone in this  why is this so easy for everyone else  my friends just work and then come home and just do stuff and they're fine  my coworkers go to work and do the same thing every single day for years and it doesn't eat them up inside  how  i genuinely don't understand  i feel like every human being would feel like me when forced to work  but 90  of people are completely fine with it  i just don't understand  but that's why i don't want to try therapy   i've done it before multiple times and it's never helped  nobody else understands  the therapists think that i am mentally ill  or that i need to try another job or whatever  but to me  it feels like the mentally ill thing would be to be happy in such a miserable existence  to just accept that   that's how life is  and continue to grind out your day to day life doing monotonous  tedious work  how do they not have a voice constantly telling them that it's not worth it  because this isn't worth it  this isn't worth living  i am literally staying alive  which is so much pointless work and so much effort  just so my family won't be sad  and that makes me sad  because i don't want to die  at all  i have a desire to live a good life  and i love my friends  and family  and good food  and cool movies  and good music  life is awesome  and it could be an amazing experience if i wasn't forced to literally sell my soul to a corporation just to afford a place to live and food to eat  which i still can't actually afford even though i'm working full time  woohoo  i've literally just been getting through work with sheer willpower  but that can only last so long  and its demoralizing seeing all my friends do it without a second thought  this literally feels like i am running a marathon with zero energy  no sleep the night before and no food at all  i am just forcing myself to take each painful step one step at a time  while every else is just running so easily  idk ,pfsrr8

4622,My Boss was mad that I arrived and left work ontime,i used to work as a receptionist at a company that sold products  it was an office job where i did a lot of paperwork  met potential customers  and took care of the office's many needs  this included keeping the kitchen stocked for the other staff members and performing some janitorial tasks to keep things looking nice  the receptionist position would have easily been a full-time job but around the time i was hired into this position the woman who was in charge of most of the accounting work was leaving and they needed help in the accounting department   now  i am not an accountant by any means  i took math 11 in high school and then never took math again  but suddenly i was now working as a receptionist and in charge of the accounting work she did  mainly related to invoicing and keeping track of the company's money  i was baffled that they were giving me these extra tasks but they were   i had two days of training to learn all my accounting responsibilities and the receptionist work and i was overwhelmed    as the weeks went by i was struggling  i told my boss frequently that if they wanted me to do invoicing i wouldn't be able to finish my receptionist duties but i was brushed off each time and told to manage my time more efficiently  by 3 30 every day i would be stressed out trying to get everything done and it didn't help that the sales staff would constantly come and ask me when i would finish their invoices  they wanted to get paid    i would try to leave the office on time if i could  especially since my husband was my ride home and he also worked for the company but in a different department  every single day he had to wait 30-40 mins because i was running around like crazy trying to finish everything i had to do  i just never had enough time  i tried to manage my time but new things constantly would come up during the day that needed to get done quickly and be prioritized  despite me telling my boss on numerous occasions that my job needed to be two different jobs they refused to hire another person and i strongly believed this wasn't my issue  if they wanted me to work two jobs in 8 hours a day it would just take longer for things to get done   every day when i left i would say bye to the other people in the office and they would look at the clock and give me a sour look  apparently  leaving when i was supposed to was frowned upon  one day as i was leaving my boss said   are you done x task  you shouldn't leave until it's done   i explained that i didn't have the time to finish it that day  considering all my extra receptionist duties that came up without notice and he said that was unacceptable  when i said i would stay an hour later if i got overtime he said that was also unacceptable     me and june stay late every day and we don't get overtime  he said   you're paid a salary so you should stay until all the work is done   please note that june was an extreme workaholic  she would arrive two hours before work and stay till 7 or later every single day without getting overtime pay  i explained that i had other commitments that i had to do in the day and couldn't stay hours overtime if i wouldn't get paid for it  this was unacceptable  apparently   as time went on things got worse  i was behind on everything and couldn't figure out how to get everything done in 40 hours a week  the truth was  my job should have been two jobs and considering i had accepted a receptionist job and they threw in the accounting responsibilities on my first day it didn't seem fair  i was one person working two jobs and they wanted me to just work extra hours with no additional pay   i ended up leaving the job and after i did they split my position into two  you know  because it was two jobs they were just trying to squeeze into one  my husband stayed at the company for a little longer and informed me that they had to add another person a few weeks later  so the job they wanted me to do on my own became three jobs   companies will cut so many corners to  save  money and the way i was treated is completely unacceptable  if you hire someone to work 8-4 but want them to stay an hour or more each day without overtime pay then you are just completely taking advantage  the lack of respect they had for me still baffles me ,pg5zk6

So I took a 5 month stress leave instead,i work in a hospital in a department with probably the worst manager you've ever seen  spends her entire day playing candy crush  sends 2 emails and goes home  i've been burn out past my limit this past year and all i needed was 2 weeks off to recover  but how our pto system works is you have to put in for a request at least 2 months in advance and then you wont find out if you got the days until the week before you asked for it  so i think 3rd times the charm  april june and august didnt work  let's try for september  i even shortened the days off down to 10  denied again   so i was furious  i called my hr department and asked about leave and how to go about that  basically they said as long as i've got a doctors note  a plan on how to get better  and the pto esl to do it i can go as long as i want  the best news i've heard all day  i told my boss and the look on her face was priceless  and now that i went on leave my entire department knows they can now so shes got 3 other people planning to go on stress leave too   should have just given me my 2 weeks,pg1dwn

4667,How toxic is the company i work for?,i work for a large engineering firm  i have been here for 10 years  with no sign of promotion  i am in early every day with the hope that i would be allowed to leave early this never happend and silly me just kept coming in early    during covid i was kept on while many of my friends were let go even tho they were good at there job i am no better at it then any of them and some are better than me    i complained to my manager when i was the only one kept on as i didnt know what was happening on projects that i wasnt involved in  it looked like the company forced  my manager to let as many people go as possible and he let everyone go to please them apart from me and him    then i got a phone call to say i needed to take a week off to swap with a new employee who had started 2 months before lockdown  he was taking my place but yet none of the other long term employees were coming back i did explain this was unfair as the new guy was not the only one with bills but the other guys were here longer    i was ignored and had to watch all my friends leave one by one and i could only agree with them as it was unfair  then when each one would leave i would ask my manger why and he would say we didnt want him as he was only a 9-5 employee anyway    now as there is not enough in my department my manger has been forced out  yes the guy who tried to please all senior management all along has been forced out as his department is underpreforming  in context we were 13 including my manager we are now 5  2 of whom are new meaning 11 left and only me and the new guy stayed as we were the only ones taking in    my manager has handed in his notice and i was called in for opinions and interviews but never considered for the managers job  i feel the company looks at me as a loyal employee who will not leave or cannot leave    i am looking for opinions on how toxic the company i work for is or do i have it wrong ,pfybaz

4672,Am I weak for bring unable to handle school?,i see a lot of people here talking about how the 9-5  work yourself to the bone lifestyle makes them deeply unhappy since it leaves very little room for free time and happiness  i was going to school not too long ago but i had to leave due to the impact it was having on my mental health   i'd have to wake up way too early to the point where i felt like i had weights attached to my limbs  then spend 6  hours in school  by the time i was getting home  i was just completely burnt out from the day  but then i had homework to do as well  and then after homework was done i'd have about an hour of studying to do   when all was said and done  i had two  maybe three hours at the most of free time  i liked to play games or see my friends but after i had finished all of that  i was just completely wiped out  i didn't have an ounce of energy left in me to do anything that would help me to blow off steam  all i could do was just lay there  half awake  half asleep   during the weekends  i could finally have my rest and free time  that's a lie by the way  the teachers always gave us weekend homework so even when we were supposed to be able to  at long last  get some proper rest  it was still hindered   this was  if it isn't obvious by now  highly unsustainable for me  things ended up hitting a boiling point and once boiling water is out of the pot  you can't put it back in  i either had to leave school with a broken mind  or stay and risk taking my own life or becoming an addict  the current education system is set-up with a one-size-fits-all approach and unfortunately for me  it wasn't a fit   the reason the title of this post is what it is  is because most people i know were able to finish school  it's left me wondering if i'm the only one who wasn't strong enough to make it through even if it would have killed me to do so  the thought that i had to be a mindless robot every day shadowed the passion of my teenagehood  all i wanted was to spend time with family and friends  engage in some of my hobbies and figure out who i was and what i wanted  however  the intense amount of work and pressure that was being thrown at me was just too much   so the question is then  was this a problem that only a minority of others and myself had  or is this commonplace among people my age today   tldr  is the intense amount of work and pressure that is being pushed onto students today more than what is acceptable  and needs to change  or is it simply the same as it's always been and people just have to suck it up ,pfudj6

4700,My experience,working as a car detailer at enterprise car rental  i am 24 years old and in school   college    previously worked here for almost 3 years i enjoyed the work a lot i really did but i ended up leaving here is my experience and what i think about the job and little about it   so at least my area i had to be at enterprise for 7 30 in the morning till 5 30  or more   i ll explain later   or monday it s always 7 00 to 5 30  and you can work half days also aswell i mostly never had a problem with the time part but   i ll explain more   so i never had half days so i was working monday 7 00 to 5 30 tuesdays 7 30 to 5 30  thursday and friday i was a 12 00 noon till 5 30 dinner and every other saturday   i had to stay pass 5 30 if their was cars to clean but whatever   but it was extremely mentally draining from the heat to cold all the weather and running around for management it got old so fast yet they gave everyone gift cards like crazy and also buy food for all of us and drinks  coffee etc    i enjoyed it   but still corporate just kept taking in a shit ton and wouldn t increase our wages also i had to clean some brutally nasty cars cause they didn t want to make the customer mad  so they would make us clean it which us i mean 2 people in the bay it took one time to clean by myself a shit show took me 2 hours and 15 mins straight yeah it wasn t fricken fun at the end of all that pay check was around 850 every 2 weeks or sometimes less  they always kept below 40 hours max i got was 35 so yeah what the fuck they are also so stupidly picky with full time i know someone that bust her ass off and she ain t full time but she s like 60 hours a week and she makes somewhere around 20  an hour which i find bullshit cause they don t want her full time cause of benefits but yet 45mins away another enterprise a desk girl is there and she s full time with benefits but not her i don t know she does cleaning in the bay and everything the other girl nope guess she don t get full time cause of smaller  town  i call laziness and corporate greed  the work  you work by getting cars cleaned so you bring them into the bay you start vacuuming everything the seats in between the seats and centre console trunk aswell  so you got to get everything out crumbs every little thing you also get stuff to assist you like different noses for the vacuum but not every location has this then going to wipe the dash interior cubby holes  cup holders everything  which is fine  getting rid of all stains coffee anything that s gross even the touch screen it s all there on the wipe list  after that you do the windows the glass cleaner   self explanatory  you clean the glass and windshields including the trunk hatches windows  if it smells really bad you spray it with deodorizer which doesn t get rid of the smell it just hides it which is dumb they should invest in real scent killer but you use this mostly if someone smokes or even if it smells terrible then you wipe the outside with brushes and then spray the hole car off   car cleaning   then you bring the car out front and park it and bring the key in and grab the next dirty one rinse and repeat  you also have to drop off cars at places either in towns or shops even other enterprises to swap cars   this i don t mind makes the day go by    so your base of operations is the bay which is like your home keep it clean buckets full with soap for cleaning the cars and tubs and containers full so they are all standing by  ready  the bay at least i worked at it sucked majorly other areas have fans for the summer to keep you cool not this one so you ll roast and sweat to death and the heater for the winter struggles to keep up with the cold we had to keep all doors shut to keep the heat in from the heater that was struggling to keep the bay warm and to melt ice off cars in winter   it needs a massive upgrade but they are to cheap to bother   with any of that i always bring it up pay  when i was there i got 14 25 covid hit so i lost one possible wage increase so another year i got 0 25 cents so i made 14 50 i should ve been making 14 75 but yeah and i think for the work we do we all are underpaid heavily why when you can work at ford as a detailer for 20 00 an hour and you have a much updated and better bay and equipment  i asked for a 0 50 raise to bring me up to 15 00 an hour they won t budge and they don t care which sucks cause higher ups are sniffing their own farts while we do all the stuff and deal with customers for my personal opinion the pay sucks ass and we all deserve better pay i don t care what anyone says and it needs to be livable wage  they also brought on new policies so if there are dirty cars around 5 30 you got to clean them all before you can go to prepare for tomorrow and this policy is trash one time  i was stuck till almost 7 i think this is absolutely unacceptable and inhuman but i don t mind stay for a tiny bit but jesus it got to far at times and also the customer is always right you might have to deal with picky customers i ve dealt with one over the almost 3 years  everyone at my location was good chill and same with other locations but yeah that s my explanation and experience i felt undervalued and under appreciated thanks enterprise for 3 years that went so downhill fast,pfn23z

4706,Are There Any Inter Union Groups,i ve been considering some of the things people have said about calls for general strikes for a while now  as well as some of the things i ve read on here casually discussing unions  there are some questions i have that i realize now i d just like to ask those who are currently in unions  kind of just out of curiosity to help further my understanding of how they work   first  do unions talk to each other  it just seems to me to make sense that even if individual unions within industries or specific companies don t have directly common interests  they would at least have existential interest in each other  as in  whether unions exist at all  are there conferences of union leaders from different industries  or specific inter-union organizing groups  if so what are the top ones   secondly  do unions  ever  help workers in other industries or companies form their own unions  to me it would only make sense if they did  since one would think if they believe unions are good for themselves then surely they would be good for others  does anyone have any stories or articles about a union in one industry   say construction workers   helping a totally different industry unionize   like factory workers   it just seems like there should be some larger union organizing forces at play  and if no such organizations exist  why not ,pfmeaj

4708,How to do deal with abusive boss without getting fired?,i wfh as a software engineer  numerous times my boss has been aggressive  condescending  lashed out  blamed me and been disrespectful towards me  another engineer also told me he seemed to laughed at me a couple times behind my back for some questions i asked him that he apparently thought were stupid questions  based on how i've seen him treat another senior engineer on the team  he treats her worse than me  he has often spoken to her aggressively  raised his voice at her  blamed her  etc  i've also heard him get aggressive  raise his voice at  and blame another senior engineer on the team  i've been trying to leave this job by interviewing elsewhere for the past year with no luck  the interviews are very technical and require alot of studying for since i work in cs  from what i've researched  it sounds like it may not be a great idea to just confront him now and call him out on his unprofessionalism  also  if i were to complain to hr or his supervisor  then i could end up looking bad and maybe even get fired  apparently the best thing to do is to get another offer  and in my resignation letter  mention all the instances this boss has been unprofessional  in the meantime  how can i continue dealing with him if he continues to get condescending  aggressive  etc  what would be the consequences if i raised my voice back or called him out on his being unprofessional ,pfnedm
4709,"Boomer principal calls teachers who won't start because of better offers ""school hoppers""",look karen  if you wanted them so badly  you should have offered them a fixed contract and decent salary  now you don't have enough teachers to start the school year  you teach about free market  but you don't like it  do you  teachers were the first sector with mass burn-out and now rarely people want to become teachers anymore  which is actually starting to become an advantage for teachers who remain  don't come complaining  if you can't compete in a highly public and subsidized sector  you are doing something wrong  maybe your work culture is shit too  maybe check your google reviews too  do boomers do that  anyway  what do you expect now from nagging in the paper  you think this is a good ad for teachers to apply to your school  what will you change  nothing  pay peanuts  get nothing ,pfop7e

4711,"Your bosses won't care if you had cancer, they have no sympathy for you.",hi reddit    i wanted to share this as this is heart breaking  this is not myself but my beloved mother  my mother hasn't been feeling well for years now  her body has been producing polyps in her bowel constantly  each year she has to continuously get them removed over and over again as they keep on appearing  there is only so much scar tissue that the body will no longer heal properly and they have to potentially removed a part of colon to remove future polyps   tumors    approx 6 weeks ago my mother took some time off as she needed 2 weeks to recover from her surgery  the surgery didn't go to well as they needed to re-schedule again  my mother requested her same employer to take another 2 weeks of recently and they simply said to her  well we are going to replace you if you can't commit  because we need reliable people  who's going to do the work   my mother simply replied if i don't get this remove i will have cancer and die  i have no control over this  my mother came home brawling her eyes out  the next day her boss just changed her attitude and became more friendly and pity with sorrow  but yesterday they were a absolute narcissistic no empathy fuckwit     i wanted to take her employer to some tribunal   fair work court and get the bosses fired for saying this shit  i can't understand that some people are this fucking low that they are beneath shit    to all of you out there  don't ever work hard  don't ever commit  say no to over time  don't ever give more and expect to receive back  do the bare minimum as you can  because at the end of the day they don't care about you if you are dead ,pfphpi
4712,Can I straight up quit without a 2 week notice,i'm beyond pissed rn   i'm entering my senior year of high school a  job  at a taco bell at the beginning of august  hoping to save cash for future college expenses   i mentioned that during the interview and my manager acknowledged that  literally repeating that she understands  college is expensive   in the entire month of august  i've only been scheduled to work four days  each shift averaging about 3 hours    how on hours especially when it's summer--when virtually all students have free time   what's more infuriating is that i haven't been paid at all  i went in this saturday and was informed i'd be paid next time i came in for a shift  okay  cool i guess even though i began my first shift early august   i call in today about my schedule and guess what  i'm not scheduled for this week  at all  not until the next weekend   i'm beyond done with this  why even hire me if you're going to waste my time  being secretary for a school club takes up more of my goddamn time   1 month  no pay  shitty schedule communication  is this the real world   does it deserve a 2 week notice ,pfo2ip
