6,"""emotional labor""","This is one big problem at work, I just can't stand all the ""hi how are you doing today"" while its been less than 24hours since i saw the same people asking the same question for MONTHS (or even years), its not like its one guy, its the whole fucking team who greets you in their own way, asking you to use strategies to reply them all differently when you just don't fucking care. I don't want to have to smile to everyone every time, I don't want to have to talk, to have to look at you, to have to speak to you and to laugh when you look at me for approbation when you are joking. I know people I like and friends I love, I have a family, I'm good, so don't expect me to be nice all the time when you are just someone with who I work, its fucking tiring and depressing.

When did we start to ask how are you and wait for a reply yet not having anything to do with it instead of being just polite with a hi or hello ? Its a torture.
