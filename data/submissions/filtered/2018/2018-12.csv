3,Quitting a farm to start a farm,i am a 24 yo male after a bout of joblessness where i was truly happy but understood it wasnt sustainable because of a lack of funds to achieve my goals of not needing to work for someone else  which is kind of ironic when you think about it i found myself back at the factory farm where my parents work and where i worked parttime for 7 years while in high school and college this time im working fulltime in a semisupervisory role with one individual who works under me i make decent money more than i ever have because ive never been able to find a job much less get an interview for a job i actually have an interest in with the bs in psychology degree that i worked so hard for i have been depressed for as long as i can remember and i have felt like a worthless lazy person for how i feel about working for somebody else until i just discovered this subreddit  i feel like i and all the other employees at this company are being raped we are selling our time of course but we are also selling our dignity as the manager who is emotionally immature screams at us when a task is done incorrectly we are selling our pride in what we do when we never see a dime for our efforts this company is notorious for its lack of raises we are selling our spirit when we efficiently and effectively complete the tasks of the farm but have to stay an additional 3 or more hours just because and i know damn well that they are only able to pay well because they profit exponentially on the labor that we provide  i am just finishing up my second semester of local community college accounting courses which have done nothing to help me even get a phone interview for accountingtype positions  i feel like i have a lot of pressure from my family and boyfriend that i live with to keep working until i find something better but there isnt anything better at least not until i can establish an income from my own farm in the future i want to produce as much of my own necessities as possible energy food clothing etc and sell the surplus to pay for the taxes on my land and thats it  i dont know how to get there without committing suicide over the draining exploitative unappreciative 45hour work week with 9 day on stretches through the many different jobs ive had these feelings still persist at least this one is bearable for my social and generalized anxiety and depression i cry almost every day and im able to cry at work because i spend a lot of time alone in the loud barns,a44srh

8,What’s your opinion on ‘hard work pays off?’,this saying never sat right with me even as a kid hard work for whom and that things never quite go your way from past experiences i feel people dont consider how much luck has to do with where one worksopportunities for work regardless if they have a good or bad work ethic  i like the term practice makes perfect because theres room for improvement and it implies something one is intrinsically interested in doing but i tend to be misunderstood when i have distaste for people commenting on my work ethic   so whats your take on it or quick responses that wont make you sound like youre lazy although being lazy sounds like the worst someone can be in capitalism or antiimprovement ,a6x1ae
9,Fucked.,this will be long brace yourself  i got a dwi which is a felony because in my state 2 in 10 years is felony previous in 2012 it wasnt really that serious just huge snow storm to where i literally couldnt park my car at a friends like i normally would do when drinking so i had to go home because i had to work and got stuck in the snow 5 minutes from my house barley failed the breathalyzer and honestly drinking had nothing to do with me getting stuck in the snow it would happen to me every morning even without the blizzard conditions anyways im not here to defend that or get out of it its my fault and i take the reprocussions being scared of a possible felony i hired a lawyer for 6000 turns out i didnt really even need to as going through this process ive seen several people in the same felony diversion program with just a public defender but none the less i got a lawyer   at the time i had a job i was at for over 2 years it looked stable enough it could have been stable enough there wasnt much i could do to get fired they relied on me for a ton of things and used the shit out of me without ever giving me much i was previously a line worker like anybody else that they cycled through from temp agencies except for that for whatever reason i had gotten hired to the actual company unlike most of my coworkers eventually i tried out the fork lift position which i was weary about because in the past at other jobs it always was a position where youre asked to do too much that literally one person couldnt do i was told not to worry about it and took the position  4 months later im full blown in this forklift position and the person who got me to do it was already gone forced out of the company in a shady situation herself and im doing exactly what i fearedeverything and anything and im doing it for 2 less than what the position is supposed to be paying according to the national average the excuse from managers and higher ups was that they didnt hire me for this position with previous experience so i didnt deserve that pay but maybe if im a good little boy as i am right now maybe ill get it down the road meanwhile im loading and unloading trucks dealing with the drivers paperworks still working on the line helping out even though every previous driver never did that as its not their damn job training new employees on everything and anything handling office related stuff troubleshooting common problemsyou get my point so i demanded the raise to at least match the national average i got it but i was down talked like a little kid and made to feel like it was a privledge and an honor it wasnt 14 is still shit pay for the amount of work i was doing sorry not sorry also i was going through managers left and right as the company was in a changing process so basically i was dealing with new supervisors who didnt know me my history with the company or anything about what im capable of and constantly having to prove my self over and overuntil one day after dealing with drama from 4 different directions and feeling like i was about to get into a brawl with 15 people whole nother storyi went to break and never came back  rewind three paragraphs and you can see my delimma the quitting of the job coincided with the dwi i quit the job just a few months after hiring the lawyer i only payed him 2000 of the 6000 now he hasnt been that great he barley contacts me he has missed a few court dates and he never has a clue whats going on with my situation etc etc but still he holds my fate in his hands and i havent payed him since the end of june so i guess im lucky he even shows up at all im actually almost done with the pre trial program weekly meetings and check ins before i quit the job i was having these strong anti work feelings about everything we talk about here in this sub life is just too short to be someone elses bitch and to be a miserable cunt every day of your life especially when its montonous sometimes even strenuous manual physical labor the reason why i was even there so long is because i could listen to podcasts and music on my headphones and skate through the day and it was actually semi enjoyable because of thatand i also had a female co worker who i got quite chummy with and became good work buddies with and enamored withuntil the company started threatening the headphones constantly for no apparent reason other than control literally and the girl got pregnant with twins and went on leave she came back but it just wasnt the same i was miserable and in the midst of the forklift position now my anti slave anti work feelings were becoming dominant theyre always there its just no one wants to hear it and i have no other means of money  so this was an absolutely terrible time to quit my job but now that ive been out of work for 6 months i am completely lost and hopeless i havent had a dime most of this time luckily i live with people who allow me to live rent free and arent kicking me out thats a whole nother story and a blessing although it does make me feel like a jokeno theyre not my parents lol i have been looking for work this whole time but im sort of unavailable because my car got repossessed in the process and im not available at all times due to the meetings i also have no bus line anywhere near me i feel like a fucking bum i honestly didnt expect it to be this hard to find a job again i suffer from social anxiety disorder depression etc and i also have a previous charge on my record thats apparently showing up to employers and making me look terrible charges were dropped while i was in jail which is why i didnt even know they still existed and its thrown me for a loop apparently employers can see it either way ive never had this much of a problem after leaving shitty jobs but here i am completely fucked and dont know what to do no matter how much i know what i need to do it just isnt happening next court date is soon and this lawyer doesent know my thoughts about all of thisjust wonders why i dont have any money for him its like im dealing with the mafia lol ive lost control of why i even started making this post and i apologise i guess if i just didnt owe this lawyer all this money i would feel so free right now id still be truing to find work anyway because i do have a kid but i can not lie because i do feel liberated while i am completely fucked right now because of the legal situation i do not regret leaving that job that was causing me so much stress life is too short it really is,a5o6yf
10,The Story of the Mexican Fisherman,an american investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked  inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna  the american complimented the mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them  the mexican replied only a little while the american then asked why didnt he stay out longer and catch more fish the mexican said he had enough to support his familys immediate needs the american then asked but what do you do with the rest of your time  the mexican fisherman said i sleep late fish a little play with my children take siestas with my wife maria stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos  i have a full and busy life the american scoffed i am a harvard mba and could help you you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor eventually opening your own cannery you would control the product processing and distribution you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city then la and eventually new york city where you will run your expanding enterprise  the mexican fisherman asked but how long will this all take  to which the american replied 15  20 years  but what then asked the mexican  the american laughed and said thats the best part  when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich you would make millions  millions  then what  the american said then you would retire  move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late fish a little play with your kids take siestas with your wife stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos,a4i3lu

25,The definition of 'work',its frustrating when i try to explain my antiwork philosophy to people and they cant see it as anything other than wishing that others suffer so i can keep watching tv and eating cheetos all day doesnt help that working out is the most popular english phrase for performing exercise i dont have a job or make money other than selling my plasma right now but that doesnt mean i dont do things in fact i think the things i do are every bit as productive as what millionaire investment bankers do to destroy the economy if not more so because im not destroying the economy by coding and writing  unfortunately work is a 4 letter word everyone immediately understands bullshit work or junkfood jobs is a little better but still requires at least a paragraph of explanation what word or phrase do you guys use to distinguish work from productive healthy expenditures of effort i mean in my opinion even the productive and healthy parts should be optional people deserve the right to be unproductive and unhealthy so long as they dont put a disproportionate burden on everyone else although even in that case its not like we would just kill off all disabled people true equality would mean everyone has the right to live like a disabled person  i like to use conscious work to describe what i do with my life and what i dont mean when i say im antiwork basically its any work i consciously voluntarily do without any promise of reward so writing would count but so would exercise but so would conducting experiments to prove my hypotheses on the other hand selling my books selling my plasma or conducting the same exact experiments i do but solely in exchange for money rather than due to a desire to sate my curiosity would not count as conscious work  how do you define work in antiwork,a2qlon

47,Sitting at “work” completely demotivated,tried quitting 6 weeks ago but boss begged me to stay with now what i realise were false promises was made redundant beginning of last month my last day is 201218 but the offer for me to stay is that im going to be on the books paid until 311218 without any annual leave deducted between 20  31 december then i get essentially a further 6 weeks of salary while on leave  issue is i recently found out a lot of information that has been withheld from me about why i was made redundant thats too much to get into but lets just say my ip i spent a lot of time researching developing and implementing and finalised between the period of resignation date and date of redundancy was sold on by my boss to a cheaper option subcontractor than keeping me on board   so now i really just cant be assed anymore to do anything why bother doing anything at all if theres no employment here come the new year   no opportunities around me right now but i have a pretty good idea for a start up and now the equipment and knowhow to get the ball rolling but if i up and leave now ill miss out on around 2800 in wages plus superannuation plus more accrued annual leave hence why im here just sucking what i can get out of this dump until its over but i just feel sick sitting here  anyways not sure why im posting except i guess just having a winge that the boss still expects me to be working happily here while he basically stabbed me in the back he doesnt know i know this   this is why im on the anti work side  employers are only out to exploit employees to the greatest extent possible then will throw you out on the street once they got what they need out of you andor find a cheaper option   much rather just run my own business and generate my own income and be self sufficient,a2v1t9
48,I have three days in a row requested off next week and I’ve never been more excited in my life.,okay maybe thats being a little hyperbolic but heres the thing my job is a really busy place and its non stop for six days a week closed sundays and i only get tuesdays and thursdays off because of class but thats about to end in a few weeks the semester for me is finished up tomorrow since all i have to do is take a quiz and be dont with it while id love to have tuesdays and thursdays to myself once these college credits are over my boss insisted that i work those days again once im done with class but next week i sorta lied and said that i have finals when irl im done the week before thankfully i requested off that wednesday so i have three full days to myself come this time next week i should also mention that while im at work the only thing i legit think about is going home at 500 im counting down the days to when i get a nice mini break from this place and it legit cannot come soon enough   if this is what adulthood is like its no wonder why so many people decide to opt out and end their own lives ,a3cyzn
49,You anti work anarchists/communists should just be honest with yourselves,   the only reason you chose your political stance is not out of empathy for your fellow proletariat but rather because you chose to become artistsmusicians and no one ended up liking your shit so because of your personal failures you blame the rest of society why do you care so much about homeless anyway  or pretend to care  its their own personal failure why would anyone be expected to build them a house with free labour   just the other day i read a post on rsocialismhttpswwwredditcomrsocialism about how degrading finding a job is lol you losers just need to grow up you dont hate the work place because of muh alenation but rather because your lazy fucks who want to leech of society to support your musical passion lol  most of you only go towards communism because you are lazy and dont want to work like the little lazy commie that you are its not a generalisation its a fact i have binge scrolled many socialistcommunistanarchist subreddits to confirm this a revolution lead by neets would never work and it makes me laugh that you do think this hahahahhahahahhahah  under your utopia we will all end up like this loser on soudcloudhttpssoundcloudcomimbredanarchy  its very obvious he is one of you because he does not provide anything of value to society the proletariat of the modern day make me laugh no sane person buys into your ideas this is not a generalisation but rather cold hard facts that you are weeping about because you know im right you pot smoking blue haired degenerates are going nowhere in life just like your own shit ideology that was funded by some fat lazy fuck karl marx no wonder you follow him lol i asked on ranarchy101httpswwwredditcomranarchy101what will happen to those that dont work and one reply was  gtwe should all be refusing to work  evidencehttpswwwredditcomranarchy101commentsa0ay5hwhatwillhappentoablebodiedpeoplewhorefuseeagfevxhttpswwwredditcomranarchy101commentsa0ay5hwhatwillhappentoablebodiedpeoplewhorefuseeagfevx  this isnt even a generalisation its the truth  now if you dont mind im going to take a shit and i hope someone cleans that up once its hit the sewers for free hahhahahahhahahha i cant you think believe this would happen under your ideology,a6s9fo
50,Guy Debord on Automation and Labor as Commodity,gtautomation which is both the most advanced sector of modern industry and the epitome of its practice obliges the commodity system to resolve the following contradiction the technological developments that objectively tend to eliminate work must at the same time preserve labor as a commodity because labor is the only creator of commodities the only way to prevent automation or any other less extreme method of increasing labor productivity from reducing societys total necessary labor time is to create new jobs to this end the reserve army of the unemployed is enlisted into the tertiary or service sector reinforcing the troops responsible for distributing and glorifying the latest commodities and in this it is serving a real need in the sense that increasingly extensive campaigns are necessary to convince people to buy increasingly unnecessary commodities  just found this in society of the spectacle thought it would fit here quite nicely ,a7hl6x

53,So my new job isn't that good,i quit my steady job that i probably could have kept forever barring personal illness and severe depression in favor of a more flexible schedule  turns out its not as flexible as id imagined after specifically telling the boss that i wanted 25 hours a week my second full week of work ends up being 40 hours which really interferes with my ability to take the programming classes ive been doing i told the boss of the place that i wanted a parttime schedule on my very first day when i was there for half an hour for paperwork and when i went to tell him about the schedule today he doesnt recall me having said that i guess im not important enough for him to remember and the value of an employee certainly isnt high enough so that hell keep his word to me or anyone else or stop passing the buck around by telling me to speak to someone else     i hate working and i hate capitalism im so over it,a44apc
54,"How long, on average, is your commute to work?",of all the jobs that offered me employment the average commute time was between 1hr20mins  1hr30mins oneway in ideal circumstances most of the jobs i scored were in neighbouring cities or on the border to neighbouring cities  curious to hear what your experiences were like,a5yl7d
55,"""I fucking hate when these bitches work slow""",were the words my supervisor uttered to me in private on the second day of my job concerning my team  every day we are constantly berated by our supervisor andor threatened with disciplinary action for even minor errors such as missing one damaged part eg a shelf leg out of the thousands of shelf legs we process even when tasks are reassigned which they rarely are when an employee does something incorrectly the newly assigned employee  even ones with excellent track records of quality and productivity  is intimidated you better do this skid right otherwise youre going to get me very angry if i find out you do this incorrectly thatll be it  and none of the employees under my supervisor do anything about this they just take it they allow themselves to be treated this way  perhaps understandably so perhaps they cannot risk losing their job or causing even more tension so it is more in their selfinterest to stay obedient  it also doesnt help that my supervisor and our shift supervisor my supervisors supervisor are family friends  i understand my supervisor has her own set of responsibilities by her superiors and there is a lot of pressure and stress associated with organizing a team and ensuring this team achieves daily goals effectively i understand she may be responding to this because elements may feel out of her control and this is her understanding of the best way to react to such a situation or even that this is a natural reaction for her  but i dont think threatening intimidating belittling scolding and yelling  constantly yelling  at people is an effective way at doing things ive worked in many hierarchical organizations and when such problems arose other conflict management approaches were applied  i work very hard every day and i am recognized as one of the more productive members of our team but i hate being treated this way and i hate when my fellow teammates are treated this way i understand even from them that they do not like being treated like this  i wonder why they do nothing about this i am currently submitting a complaint to hr regarding this,a7rkgd

61,Feminisms relationship to work,first of all i just found this sub so if this is off topic or not related with this sub im sorry   i am female and was raised in europe by a feminist also the area i live in has very high feministic standards from the very first second of my live i was raised to be strong and independent i was raised by my mother telling me how i could never be dependent of a man otherwise he will destroy me i have to add here that she was a sahm for 20 years  work is a virtue the highest point of live according to how i was raised a job according to people around me was the peak of live the absolute freedom and empowerment for women the ultimate goal i should have as a woman to be modern and valuable   the thing is  i dont see any of this work for me is not a virtue to see work as positive and not as a weakness or something only the lower classes have to pursue is a rather new concept that developed after the industrial revolution and even back then work was already criticised work is not the ultimate goal  whether work is seen as positive or negative is totally dependent on when you lived and on the current philosophy  i have depression i have an anxiety disorder and a dissociation disorder especially when i am put under stress my entire live i dreamt of running away and living in a small forest hut  i have a hard time with that thought i was raised to believe that without work i am not worth anything that i betray other women and what they fought for that i am weak and just lazy  while lazy is seen as a bad trait  but i dont feel empowered by being a slave to a job i dont feel empowered to loose 8hlunch breakgetting to the job and back each day of my live i dont feel free and independent  its the opposite i am threatened with my live to stay in this job otherwise i wont get payed and i will starve   the biggest lie is that work gives us a purpose or a meaning in our live while the only thing we are is interchangeable pieces in a big system women arent empowered by work they are just brought to the workforce so theres even more people giving their life to the economy  i dont know how people in this sub feel about it can you relate,a3g26q
62,"Quit Another Job, and I Don't Regret It",so the newish job that i got in an attempt to get a flexible schedule for myself turned out to be run by exploitative capitalists who didnt take my needs into consideration they gave me too many hours four weeks in a row so that i had difficulty focusing on my education they didnt give a regular schedule they often had me come home in the evening one day and report in the morning the next day that alone was enough to make me want to quit     then to make matters worse they would regularly give me infrequent breaks my last day there this previous friday they actually broke a us labor law by letting me go more than five hours without a break i hadnt had breakfast that morning my own fault so i was extremely hungry and just wanting to eat of course you cant really eat in the drivethrough and it was a friday so everyone was using their fresh new paycheck to buy fast food     on that day they ran out of   chicken nuggets   chicken tenders   salads   caramel drink mix   chocolate milk   and the frappe machine hadnt been working for the last two days     when yet another eveningtomorning shift came between friday and saturday i sat down to figure out my budget and i realized that since february 1st fell on a friday id have four paychecks this coming month to pay my bills so i really didnt need the money and id already been extended an offer anyway i was already hired elsewhere at another place that promised me the hours i wanted     so i just didnt show up on time for my shift i washed the single work shirt that they gave me and expected me to wear four to five times a week eight hours a day along with the stupid hat that made me look like a goof i took a nap and walked in at about three oclock in the afternoon     of course it was so busy there that i couldnt just say hey youre full of shit and ive had enough all the managers were occupied working because thats how fast food is they like to do all the work themselves and never actually show or teach people how to do it themselves     i ended up just walking to the small managers office leaving my uniform junk on the cold metal folding chair and walking out without another word and that as they say is that,aay0l8
