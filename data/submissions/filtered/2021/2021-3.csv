19,Automation,i'm writing this to address some misunderstandings about automation   specifically these articles coming out about the  stretch  warehouse robot   the issue is that a lot of these articles are actually just anti-union propaganda  since amazon workers are trying to unionize  and are basically just corporate terrorism   i was reading one of these articles about  stretch  a warehouse robot with an articulating arm  with the undermessage of the article being  this will replace warehouse workers   and it is union propaganda  because making a robot similar to stretch is childs play for boston dynamics  a company funded by darpa  which is a us govt entity that creates alien technology   highschool students can make something like  stretch  this isn't some big development  because we don't have millions of boston dynamics teams to service every amazon warehouse on earth   the issue is  most people didn't read the article   this warehouse robot is still piloted by someone   all this  development  really reflects is a further alienation of the worker from their labor   there will still be someone who needs to  pilot  this triumph of  automation   there will still need to be someone to code and upgrade it's programming  someone at the call center to service troubleshooting  there will still need to be someone to manufacture it's parts  someone to do maintenance  someone to dispose of it when it has outlived it's usefulness   you will always need someone  somewhere  to mine the very ore that it's components are made from out of the earth   the issue that any form of automation will constantly run into is that it posits that the goal of capitalism is the preservation of  and slow growth  of capital  rather than growth by any means necessary   as soon as a machine  replaces  some job for humans  the human workforce will be thrown back into the fire once more  they will always find a job for them because  this is an  all hands on deck  situation   any automation simply accelerates the growth of capital   if this  stretch  robot were to be adopted by amazon  one possible situation is that they are able to now demand more of their workforce  since they are no longer performing physical labor   they will probably be under more intense mental and scheduling demands  controlled more effectively  as their capitalists demand a more unreasonable output from their workforce due to  human limits  being addressed   that satirical  wage cage  where you need to ask your manager to unlock your articulating arm cage to go to the bathroom immediately comes to mind    as long as capitalism exists there will never be true automation  there will never be a genuine removal of the  need  for some worker   workers will only be further alienated  their position in the processes of capitalim will be devalued  and further exploited   as industry becomes more and more sophisticated  through the use of more sophisticated machinery  workers will transition into more specialized jobs to sustain a more and more industrialized workforce   this also makes the whole society more precarious  as it depends on a constantly shrinking workforce that no longer can comprehend the immensity of processes that hold up that society ,mh6erf

24,Being squeezed dry,i work for a community mental health center in a small midwest city  i worked my way up from part time to full time case management with kids  i used to really enjoy working with kids but now all i can see is us breaking them like horses and indoctrinating them into the cult of work   i recently attended a training for aba therapy for kids with autism and the whole training felt inhumane and like we were training the kids like dogs  to make matters worse my peers were all very excited for this training  mostly new hires  who all spoke to how applicable the training was in our work with clients   i really pride myself on my relation with the kids on my caseload and that they feel like i am a safe space to discuss troubling things in their lives or that they can just let go and be themselves around me  the center i work for though continues to heap new work onto the position because they  reorganize over and over and over again and every time it's the lowest paid full-timers who get a slew of new paperwork as part of the expectation for the position  i have watched the center roll back expectations for paperwork completion from a week to three days to one day now over the course of three years  the standard for service delivery has risen higher and higher too despite evidence that the effectiveness of the services decreases as caseloads become higher  i feel it is clear and plain-faced that the organization is trying to squeeze as much out of their low wage staff as possible   i have no delusions that the university i attended pushed me through my social work degree  i was a stem major and floundered for years  i was never particularly prepared to live on my own and my schoolwork suffered  imagine my surprise when i switched to a social work degree and started getting straight a's   so here i am  i don't know what to do moving forward  i want to go back to school  i want to find a new job  but more than anything i just want to be happy  my grandfather passed recently and he was a forklift driver with the same cannery for 45 years  i used to wonder how he could work the same job for so long or get fulfillment from a job he wasn't personally passionate about or made a difference in other people's lives but i have realized how foolish i was to make that judgement  that rather than living to work he worked to live with consistency and mutual respect to provide for the people he loved  and the position he was in is really the best we can hope for   love y'all and today the only power i feel i have is in sharing my experience ,mhcp9n

28,I need to unsubscribe from this subreddit for my own mental health,the u s  labor economy systems are really fucked  i think we all understand that  i agree with 99  of the posts of this subreddit  whenever i m scrolling through reddit  which is most of my free time  i just get really depressed whenever i look at posts on this sub  it just reminds me how messed up of a system i was born into  hospitals are businesses  employers are greedy  and quality of life is not a priority for our leaders  i am apart of the working class  i work full time  i pay rent that is more than a mortgage  i will never be comfortable enough to have my bills on auto pay  i know the top 1  percent run this country  whether i like it or not  i wish for them to be taxed more but it will never happen because they are the ones supporting politicians  they just hide behind their tax shelters and use bank accounts in other countries to avoid taxes  i understand that some people believe that taxation is theft  but it s not fair that i pay more taxes than some millionaires  if the government is stealing from me  than they should be stolen from too  i m literally unsubscribing from this sub just to help me ignore the truth  because if i don t  i just get depressed  like it or not there is nothing we can do about it  we can join together and try to vote in politicians that will try to do good but it will never happen  money is power  that s why bernie has dropped out in 2016 and 2020  because he is anti billionaires  and since billionaires run the government  they will never fund him enough to win the democratic party  they will just push through the guys that will do nothing about it  billionaires will just fund the guys that will leave them alone  politics aren t about helping the people of this country  they are about helping themselves  we will never see a federal minimum wage increase  we will never see better health care  and we are all just gonna have to live with it  whether we like it or not ,mgxcw9

44,"At work, bored out of my mind, and need to rant about the insanity work can cause.",you just wake up  eat  work  come home  try to de-stress  but you can t  so you resort to stress eating or absorbing your mind into video games  then barely get any sleep because your sleep is spent dreaming about the work you hate because of how burnt out you are on it  you constantly get stuck in a backbreaking infuriating cycle of work never able to de-stress  delving further and further into the realm of an almost schizophrenic level of insanity until the day you die  constantly being bent over and fucked in the ass by corporate-psychopath bosses who are incapable of viewing you as a human being    example  my old boss often showed signs of psychopathy  but the moment that took the cake was when one of my coworkers quit because our boss got mad that she needed to take a day off due to her sister having complications during childbirth and she needed to be with her in case anything happened  his exact words to her were  so you re going to let this get in the way of your job  work before family  fun  joy  happiness  physical health  etc   you don t get paid based on how hard you work  you get paid based on how hard you are to replace and that s just the truth  you work like  what  260 days a year  sacrificing time that could be spent with your family and loved ones selling your soul at a place you hate just to afford basic human necessities that are  by default  denied to you  then get a 1 week vacation per year  if you re lucky to get one at all  until the day you die or are too old to be able to work  wtf  i can t do this  i love my girlfriend but in the long run i can t see myself living such a meaningless existence  i ve already attempted suicide before  prior to meeting my girlfriend  partly because of personal issues and childhood troubles  and partly because of the maddening infinite cycle of work  i m starting to fall into the same cycle of thoughts that lead me to my first suicide attempt  the only difference this time is i have something holding me back and preventing me from doing it  which is the fact that with how close we are  my girlfriend would fall into as dark a state of mind as mine if i were to die  a breakup  sure  she could move on  but i know for a fact that even post-break up she would be completely devastated if she found out i died  so i can t do that to her    honestly  the idea of having a family sounds nice  but i m torn on actually having one because i m not sure if i want to force more souls into this world  our potential kids  just so they can then be forced to endure the same cycle of bullshit that me and her go through  it s cruel  yeah  unlike my childhood  our kids would have a great  magical early life  but i can t save them from the dreary  maddening onslaught of bullshit that the world will greet them with when they become adults    idk man i just need to rant  i don t understand the people that can delude themselves into thinking that  work  is meaningful  and that you re not a good human being if you don t sell your soul to a corporation every day until the day you die ,mgod0y

55,Some thoughts about bootstraps,i feel like there is some merit to the whole pull yourself up by your own bootstraps arguement  obviously you should expect food and labor when you yourself have done nothing to deserve it  it should be a sort of trade  a trade of one kind of energy for another   but the thing is  with how companies are operating  the company owners themselves are doing just that  especially with the larger companies  they are not providing a fair trade of energy  the workers take the brunt of the labor and energy expenditure then get a small percent of what their work is worth  these company owners are the ones who aren t pulling their bootstraps  they steal the energy from their workers that they don t deserve  and this causes a debt    i think this is also the cause of many of us average folks not being able to afford our own existence now  because the company owners literally stole it from us  we did pull ourselves by oyr bootstraps  we work hard  we deserve the fruits of our labor   but people like the owners of these huge corporations  corrupt government officials  landlords  etc  they don t do their share but then they steal our energy without doing the work to provide back for it and that s why our economy is shit and why average folks can t afford shit  because the fruits of our labor is being stolen by lazy people who can t pull their own bootstraps and instead steal other peoples fucking boots   this is why i agree with many who are starting to say that localism is the answer  it helps to elliminate this debt by us average folk providing a fair  or as close to fair as we can get  exchange of energy  the answer is to stop supporting businesses that steal their employee s boots    that s my thoughts  neither right nor left are wrong  we do need to pull ourselves by our own bootstraps  but we also need to stop companies from leeching off of our hard work ,mhi0lq

58,Ramblings about some ideas I have about work,is it possible to reframe our thinking about work so we can live happier lives  is the word  work  the issue here  i understand the need to be paid for one's services but what if instead of seeing it only through the perspective of a job for which we receive payment  if instead we saw it as a project    let's say you have a personal project that you really want to  work  on  working on that project will bring fulfillment to your life no matter if you get paid or not  similarly we can think of companies as the way for the owner to fulfill his project or projects  if you are not happy working on such a project you can always move to one you are happy with  if you are happy with even an administrative role within that overall project then that's good for you  would time be better invested in the long run to trying to find and becoming qualified to do that job   another idea is if you don't want more control over your own future then one should think about creating their own business  you get to be independent and can treat employees how you would like to be treated  personally if i were an owner of a business i would place the human aspect of recruitment first and foremost   i've also been thinking about what i actually want to do in life and wondering if its sustainable  the first big issue i have is trying to live an independent lifestyle and moving out from a fixed 9-5 schedule  maybe farm life would suit me  i get to grow my own food  i could have solar panels to power my home  there would be few things i would have to pay the government  i'm a software engineer so i could think about working remotely from there too    another thing i would consider is instead of constantly looking for a promotion and climbing the ladder or learning new technologies  i would instead take a job i'm overqualified to do  something artistic or creative  maybe this way i'll be valued more for my work and i can do the job with relative ease  after a certain point  having an extra bit of money is not important  i'd rather focus my energy of budgeting and optimizing    anyways  that's my thoughts  feel free to pick them apart  i'm still learning how to approach the world of work and life in general without losing my sanity ,mgi5hd

84,"Living in the UK, I can't deal with working much longer, any advice for claiming benefits?",i work a full time job  the pay is ok  but my mental health is declining in a very scary way  sundays are bleak  it affects my partner when she sees me in this mood  i try and be ok on sundays  but really i'd rather just be alone at that time so i don't make her worry   during the week  when i get home from work i find myself breaking down and weeping more and more  i punch things  even banged my head on the wall a few times today  i just don't care about the work i do  i make mistakes constantly because i'm not focused  i wake up angry and utterly gutted that again  i have to get up and drive the same drive to work i've done countless times  to the same building  through the same door  it actually makes me feel like throwing up sometimes  i'm so tired when i get home from work that i can't do anything  friends ask me to go out during the week but i don't want to do anything  i just try and grasp for time to myself  i need so much sleep to prevent the day of work from being grim as fuck  being tired at work is the most sickening thing  time feels like it's dragging claws across my soul as the clock ticks on   30 more years of this  really  it's not worth it  it's no life  friends think i should go to therapy as if it's my outlook that's the problem  not the fact that 5 days of every week isn't mine  then of the two days off  one is spent in a depression because i have to repeat the process again the next day  my friends tell me not to think about it and to focus on the good things  most of my memories are of work  since that's where i am most of the time   does anyone have any experience claiming benefits long term  what can i get  i can't do this anymore  it's killing me and there doesn't seem to be any point to life if this is what's in store for the next 30 years   on a side note  i do feel like most people seem ok with it  some people where i work seem to enjoy the challenge of the job  the ceo sends out insane emails telling us that we're all a family and that it's all very exciting what we're doing  i can not be excited about doing the same thing over and over for 40 hours a week for 30 more years   i'm just so angry all the time  either that or just depressed  mostly it is anger though  i have so much hate in me and it's ruining everything   fuck fuck fuck ,mhc6wt
85,Most likely going to get fired for being sick,i just started a new job on monday  today is wednesday and when i woke up this morning i felt a little off  a few minutes after sitting up to try and compose myself i decided to stand up slowly and start getting ready for work  well pretty much 30 seconds after standing up i had to run to the bathroom and throw up  i threw up about five different times  but i still headed into work in person to tell them i could not work mostly because i don t know who to call when i m sick  now i work at a restaurant as a prep cook so not only should i not be working when i m sick but it s also kind of illegal  i get into work and my supervisor at the time just makes me feel awful for getting sick  tells me it s really complicated and that if i m sick he might have to go home and makes me feel bad for all that stuff  i even offered to come in on my off day to make up the hours cause i felt really bad  so he made me call my chef and then i had to take the little health inspection we do every day before work  well after sitting outside for 20 minutes they told me i wasn t clear to work which i already knew but then they also told me i couldn t come back for 10 days  i m super upset i just got this job and i feel like they already hate me because i m only two days in and now i have to take 10 days off because i threw up  so i text my supervisor and i text my chef and my chef is at least somewhat understanding but my supervisor literally said to me and i quote  don t care  go doctor let us know how you feel  thank you  i keep telling myself i should ve maybe just sucked it up and went to work and lied but then i keep thinking about how wrong it would be of me to be touching someone s food after throwing up a bunch this morning  it s a real shame that jobs have a policy in place but then make you feel bad for utilizing the policy  anyways i m pretty sure they re going to fire me so   ,mh4h9n

95,I tried to do it right.,i've tried my best  i really did    i got trained in a trade  but  i have a neurological disorder that would prevent me from ever working in that trade professionally  the trade school had no trouble taking my money  knowing they were training me for something i had no chance of working in     so  i got a degree in a thing i love and do well  here's a loan  everybody said that jobs wouldn't care what the degree was in  they said that it just mattered that i had a degree    then  they started saying that i had wasted my time getting training in the thing that i love  so  i got a degree in the thing that was supposedly lucrative that i hate  but  so many people did the same thing that the job market was flooded with people who had the same skills    i send out dozens of applications a day knowing that 50  are probably fake or just companies farming data  i lie in interviews about liking high-stress  fast paced work environments  i pretend to give a rip about company values  as if a company were an entity that could have values    i take the jobs i can get  i have three  60  hours per week with an incredibly varied schedule that precludes making plans of any sort  but  they're minimum wage contract jobs with no benefits  i daydream about having dental coverage  keeping teeth is a luxury  i guess    now  i'm faced with a tide of people telling me to just get a side hustle  it's my fault that i'm not on top of my finances because i'm not working hard enough  not working enough hours  get a gig  a hustle  but  that has even less security than contract work  and  when would i do that  where are these hours of the day going to appear  i'd have to borrow from my sleep again  and  that'll kill me in the long run    looking at the numbers  i'll never be out of debt at this rate  i'll never own a house  i'll never retire  i'll never be able to afford end-of-life care  i'll keep at this  prying at the doors of stability for the rest of my life  lining someone else's wallet    i tried to do it right  i've developed myself into an educated and hardworking employee  several times over  the bank can get their minimums  my bosses can get my minimum effort  i tried working hard and got nowhere  i may work hard again somebody  but i'm done for now ,mgn8i8
96,A different view,just to give a different perspective as most posters on here seem to come from different backgrounds than me   i am a relatively high finance executive at a large public company  and the main function of my job is to help manage our profit margin  largely sitting in on meetings and discussing the ideas other departments put together  and occasionally throwing in some of my own  blended with reviewing  auditing  and analyzing our financial statements      amp x200b   whether it's labor optimization  inventory  revenue growth  capital planning  etc  i've done pretty much all of it  and i think the one thing people on this thread get wrong is that people think there is malicious intent coming from a company's management when callous decisions are made   no matter how high in a company you go  someone is breathing down your neck for results even the ceo  there is no such thing as good enough  and vacation time is always looked down on      amp x200b   the worst part is  in my view  that it's a self feeding cycle that forces our economy to function this way   people demand bargain basement prices for stellar quality   if you think about that for a minute  you'll realize one of two things is happening when you get those great prices  either you're being lied to about the quality  or something is happening behind the scenes to allow the product to maintain quality at such a price  because remember the golden rule  there is no free lunch      amp x200b   the food industry is a great example   people love cheese  and cheese is expensive  so in order to get it to the masses and fill the ravenous demand  companies had to get creative    first  they tried creating a product that was almost cheese  velveeta  but once people started realizing that it wasn't really cheese  and just effectively toxic waste  sales started not doing so great   the demand for cheap cheese was still there though  and companies had to again get creative      amp x200b   in order to get people real cheese  and keep prices low  animal abuse was used instead   cows are now treated like machines and rarely allowed outside  if at all  let alone allowed to graze like they should  locked away in factories  where consumers don't see them   now consumers get their product and quality so long as they play along with what's happening      amp x200b   pick any industry that has been scaled and you'll find effectively the same thing  just replace cows with chickens  factory workers  customer service reps  amazon drivers anything that requires large quantities of living beings to deliver its product or service  but has a customer base that isn't willing  or able  to pay what the true worth of the good or service is      amp x200b   this leads to the other end of the cycle   imagine the amazon worker barely scraping by on 15 hr  this person is in no position to be eyeing the ethics of his food  housing  or other goods and services he or she needs in order to prevent death   thus  he or she is forced to become the very demand that is driving down his or her own wages      amp x200b   there are obviously other factors at play that suppress wages for the bottom  40  of the work force  unskilled immigration  globalization   international labor markets  the destruction and vilification of unions  but i think they all take a back seat to the obsession american's have for a good deal   sure you could go buy the high quality local famers market  or grass fed meet  or locally made domestically sourced cotton shirts that would all help create middle class jobs  but people won't  because walmart offers immediate gratification for your bank account at the expense of the american working class for decades to come   so which came first  the chicken or the egg ,mgwej0

101,"Asked for sympathy, met with confusion",before the pandemic i worked for a place where a small part of my job was to feed reptiles frozen rats    now before i started working here i had pet rats and they were starting to get old  in fact i had already lost one to a pituitary tumor  and still had two  but knew that at most they had maybe 2 years left    now i had no issue feeding the reptiles normally  they weren t my rats i was feeding them  but i was thinking ahead and thought to the day i would inevitably have to say goodbye  and i didn t think i d be able to feed the reptiles in the few days immediately following a pets death    i told my supervisor as much  and i was met not with the sympathy i had been expecting  but with confusion as to why i couldn t get over it  and i d have to realize these weren t my pets    where i get hung up  is that o wasn t saying i couldn t do it  ever  just immediately following a death as it would remind me of my sweet pet i had lost   but i guess sympathy was too much to expect  anyway they laid me off last march  so i guess it s not an issue anymore,mgnaj4
102,"""Inactivity Kills Millions: Movement the 'Miracle Pill' That Could Save People and Planet""",   and this talks more about physical exercise and urban planning  but it definitely relates to our modern work culture        if i asked you - pre-pandemic - to think about public health  your mind would likely go towards flu jab initiatives  healthy eating campaigns  and posters warning us of the dangers of smoking  you probably wouldn t think about urban planning - but if we want to truly combat one of the worst health crises on our hands  it should be a public health concern   inactivity is currently the world s fourth leading cause of death  it's a problem often confused and conflated with laziness and personal choice  but in reality the issue is geographic  systemic  and woven into the structure of modern living   in short  if we want to fix our increasingly sedentary world  we have to redesign it   political correspondent and cycling enthusiast peter walker dedicates a chapter of his new book to this exact issue  the miracle pill  why a sedentary world is getting it all wrong is an eye-opening read  addressing our global inactivity problem and suggesting solutions for readers   the more i read  the itchier i became to leave my sofa and get moving  after a couple of chapters  i ended up downloading the audiobook version so i could pace around my neighbourhood while listening to the seemingly endless bleak figures about the scale of our inactivity problem   currently  1 5 billion people around the world are so inactive they are risking their long-term physical health  every year an estimated 5 3 million people die from causes related to inactive living - roughly the population of norway  an extraordinary 80 per cent of british children move so little that they face a future with poorly developed cardiovascular systems  weak bones and chronic illness   these are just three of many statistics walker presents and explores in his book  but far from being a guilt-inducing read  making a reader feel ashamed of their desk job or reliance on their car  walker manages to instil a relentless sense of hope throughout   during the book it is repeatedly made clear that patterns can be reversed  health can be improved  and it s never too late to start moving   most importantly  however  walker never assigns blame for this public health crisis to individuals  we haven t all become collectively lazy on a catastrophic  global scale  the problem is far bigger and more structural than any one person s choice to swap exercise for netflix   how is urban planning linked to inactivity  solving this sedentary crisis requires  in part  a rethink in how we design our towns and cities    we ve designed the world such that in many  many places driving is more or less the only thing you can do  walker tells me   but if we could all harness the power of activity  our lives could be dramatically altered   the book s name - the miracle pill - relates to a study in denmark that tracked 30 000 randomly selected people over the course of 15 years  after adjusting for all other factors  the people who cycled to and from work  an average commute of just 15 minutes across the group  were 40 per cent less likely to have died during the research period    it s this sort of statistic which helps you understand why some experts can go a bit misty-eyed when they talk about activity  walker writes in the book   it s also why so many of them compare everyday movement to the miracle-giving pill   he argues that were a team of scientists to discover a drug with the same life-enhancing effects   a nobel prize would be more or less guaranteed  yet despite the obvious health benefits for people and planet  no such prescription for mass movement has been given   throughout the book  the experts walker talks with repeatedly explain that the decline in global activity levels is because we have systematically removed the need for  incidental movement  from our lives  incidental movement is the activity that happens naturally throughout our day  not purposeful exercise  but things like walking to the shops or cycling to work   if we can redesign our towns and cities to support incidental movement and cycling  it will be better for planet and people   as more of us work from behind desks  drive to supermarkets  and - especially at the moment - no longer even have a commute  it s increasingly easy to be inactive for the majority of your day   interestingly  though  activity levels tend to be better in cities    there s more people who will even just walk 10 minutes to get a bus or train  rather than just get into their car and drive straight to where they need to go  explains walker    so my exhortations for people to cycle and walk more are great if you live in the city  or even in a town  but if you live in a kind of small village and your nearest shop is a mile or two away and there s not even a pavement to get there - then often the only safe option is to drive   he uses the cycling-loving netherlands as an example   the dutch are obviously very well known for having bike paths in urban areas  but in lots of rural areas  too  they will have a kind of separated footway and bike lane    that s the kind of thing you need to think about  you need to think about how places can be designed to allow people to move  to an extent this lies in the redesign of cities and towns  allowing for more cycling and more walking    the interesting case study for this is all these low traffic neighbourhoods  ltns  which are being introduced partly in london  and lots of other cities  to make it easier for people to cycle or walk   for change like this to happen  walker adds  it s up to our governments    we need central government to get involved  it's too big for it to be left to individual local councils   getting politicians to take notice  however  is a different matter entirely    i once asked the head of the dutch cyclists  union what she would do if she was in britain to get more flexibility  she said  well i d start 30 or 40 years earlier than you are now  and that s almost the most difficult thing  because no one wants to be at that starting point   the pandemic may have helped shift perspectives almost a year ago  as much of europe entered our first wave of national lockdowns  there were reports from across the continent of nature and wildlife  recovering  in the uk  for the first time since the second world war  daily exercise was mandated to the nation as we were each allowed an hour outside our homes to move    parks started to half-resemble some sort of idealised victorian sanatorium  full of joggers  brisk walkers  people skipping or lifting weights  writes walker in his book s introduction   when i speak with walker he reflects on how people reacted to these early weeks of lockdown    a lot of people who live in urban areas had this period where they suddenly thought  oh my goodness  the sky s really blue  the smog and smoke has gone  the air feels clean  - and a lot of people really like that  and they liked the fact that they could cycle around their local streets  there was no traffic on the roads   a year into the pandemic  many people  will be quite desperate to get back to the office  he caveats  but there has undoubtedly been a widespread desire for improved air quality  less traffic  and greater connections with green space   pre-covid  the idea of governments  especially in the uk  intervening in public health as dramatically as we ve seen over the last year would have been unimaginable  but walker feels this same kind of approach is needed when it comes to inactivity    we ve had a period now where entire economies have been more or less closed down for a year to save a lot of lives  but arguably inactivity over two  three  or four years will kill more people than covid has    there is this idea that perhaps the bar for what the public will accept in terms of health interventions has been raised   when will the  miracle pill  power of activity be realised  though the netherlands is a pioneer when it comes to urban design that encourages movement  figures in the eu are still dismal  two-thirds of the adult population don t reach the minimum activity levels needed to be healthy   however  walker says  a revolution could be just around the corner  though it s clear we needed to start decades ago   things could change very  very quickly   he uses an analogy from his first book  how cycling can change the world  about how bikes were the dominant presence on the roads in 1890s britain    there was this long debate about whether the motoring movement should be allowed to join  explains walker    it was seen as this kind of innovation  this novelty - these strange people who drove cars with a man in front waving a flag  but within 20 years the cyclists had virtually gone  the cars had taken over - and nobody expected it    so these revolutions come  and they re not necessarily the one that you were waiting for  but  you know  things can change very  very quickly ,mgm92h

113,We just lost our best receptionist because she wouldn't be owned by us entirely.,rant   it's hard to find a good receptionist at a veterinary office  they need to have some basic medical knowledge  be very organized  good under pressure  polite but persistent  need to be able to remember a lot of details  they go over our puppy plans and other things  and so on  they are also the face of the practice-- they're who people hear when they call  see when they come in  when it's not covid  and talk to on their way out   and we've struggled to find good ones  it seems like we can find nice receptionists who aren't organized  and we can find organized receptionists who aren't patient  we just struggle to find ideal ones  and you at least need that one good one whom everyone else can turn to when they need help  it's okay to have a couple  just okay  receptionists  as long as you have your rock there too   we had our rock  she wasn't always nice-- sometimes she had a bit of an edge-- but she was good    and when things were slow  she'd lean on the counter or sit on it  and get on her phone   our manager never said anything because she was still doing more work than every other receptionist  i never said anything because there was never a time when i needed something done and she wasn't doing it   i am the veterinarian  it's effectively a 1-doctor practice  the owner does surgeries  but only basic spay neuter  and leaves at noon most days  he's semi-retired  our receptionist had a job  and she did it  and she did it better than anyone else  and then she took time to enjoy herself when there was time to spare   but the cameras caught her sitting on the counter a few too many times  so the owners pressure hr to pressure the manager to say something  and it turned into a fight  she ended up walking out  and she ended up not coming back   look  i get that there are some issues there  for example  even though she gets stuff done and the others don't  her example could cause them to want to also be on her phone  but other than that  i think the rest of the arguments are bullshit   i'm paying her  so she should be working  yeah  you paid her to be a receptionist  not to own her soul for 8 hours  if the place needs cleaned  you should hire someone to clean it  you know good and well that the 20 minutes here and there that the receptionist spends cleaning it doesn't constitute the undertaking of a necessary task  and it's obviously not a task that will be done to completion anyway  it's make-work  busy-work  and if it needed to be done someone needed to be scheduled and hired to do it    obviously there are things that are part of her job that sometimes can be done  she should stock the shelves  call upcoming appointments  and so on-- things that are literally part of her job  that are written into her job description  that won't get done if the receptionists don't do them  but she was doing those things  dammit  but now she's gone  on the principal that we own her  as opposed to we hired her labor to complete specific jobs  and if she gets them done efficiently  she can take time to herself   it bugs the crap out of me  it goes double because no one is going to say shit to me  i'm the vet  i'm sitting here on my laptop literally with my arms over a pile of records who are waiting for callbacks  but no one is going to say anything to me  because i don't have a security camera pointed at my office  because i'm  on salary  for whatever other reasons  somehow i'm special  i grant that i'm a little harder to replace  though certainly not irreplaceable  but there's more to it than that  i think there's an attitude that if you're a low-wage employee  you're owned by the business during work hours  while as a higher-earning professional  i'm allowed to conduct myself as i see fit  under the presumption that i'm just a different class of being who will self-police  well  guess what  i'm probably the laziest  least efficient person in this office if i'm being honest    and now our office is just a little bit worse because one of the receptionists who often kept me in line  she was very perceptive and even though she couldn't see into the office  she always knew when i was fucking around vs when i was actually busy  and would very politely say  don't forget doc you've got x to do  at just the right times where i'd feel guilty and hop right up to get it done   don't get me wrong  it's not like i have  spare time  at my job  i don't want anyone to think i'm just sitting at my desk all day  i'll pay for this post later  the practice will close at 5 and i'll get out at maybe 6 or 7 if i'm lucky  and this is an unusually slow afternoon where i don't have patients waiting    but as far as using my time effectively  or never getting on my phone-- fuck that  i'm terrible  but it's okay  because low-wage workers are worthless  existing only to perform the labor of the owners  and it's just an attitude that's baked into everything      okay thanks for listening to my rant ,mgsw8f

125,"""We could have discussed it...""",started a new role in january after an all too short interview with the owner  where they touted the  work life balance  of the firm  white collar job in accounting  salaried exempt  100  remote  don't care about the hours  just get the work done  knowing the industry  a little overtime was expected  so i figured there'd be some balance like shorter hours in non-crunch weeks  that should have been my first red flag  my second was the email from the owner to  everybody  the day after i started with  this year's work plan  which included 2 300 hours on the clock  holidays and vacations not figured into this calculation  mind you  that was shortly revised to 2 250 hours  to encourage work life balance  i shrugged it off and clocked my 40 hours a week for 7 weeks  figuring the worst that would happen is that my promotion potential would be limited by the fact that i wasn't putting in 55 hours a week  like everyone else  i did good work  senior people in the firm liked me  everybody seemed to not care about the fact that i clocked out at 5 00 p m  on friday and was gone until 8 30 a m  on monday  there were rumblings during  all hands  meetings about  saturday lunches at the office starting soon  which i ignored because i was 100  wfh  y'all want to work saturdays  go nuts  i'll deal with whatever you sent me on monday when i'm on the clock   march 7th  a sunday  my personal phone rings at 4 15pm  it's a number i don't recognize  so i let it go to voicemail  it's the weekend  i don't know you  leave a voicemail  if it's important  i'll call you back  the next morning  i log into my work computer  email from the closest thing to a manager that i have   we need to discuss your work hours  cue a 25 minute phone call where they basically talked at me about how important it is that everyone does the hours they laid out in the work plan  they'll resend it to me just in case i didn't get it  and implying that my future with the firm was dependent on my  getting with the program  they touted themselves for working 60 hours a week last year while helping a family member with a health issue  they talked about how  it used to be 80-90 hours  so be glad it's not like that anymore  i nodded and smiled through the whole lecture  started looking for a new job that afternoon  off the clock  mind you  started working a little overtime  remember  salaried exempt  so no compensation for this  found out during that call that the firm had been hourly the year prior but had changed to a salaried exempt classification in the last 12 months  gee  wonder why that is   in the ensuing weeks  i got several emails addressed to  everybody  about how the work plan was  required  or  expected  and that we all needed to do our part to ensure the work was fairly distributed and that no one was shouldering all of the burden  had a couple of conversations with the owner that all pretty clearly communicated that they expected everyone to  put in the time  to  reap the rewards   interviewed on the 15th with a company i worked for several years ago  breezed through the interview process  got the job offer yesterday  put in my two week's notice with the current firm  about an hour after i put my notice in  the owner calls me   hey  is it too late to talk about this   it was too late when one of your managers called me at 4pm on a sunday  come to find out the next morning they wanted to talk about my work hours  it was too late when i got an email that week with a copy of the  work plan  and the implicit suggestion that my failure to put the  required  hours in would be detrimental to my future  it was too late when you sent an email last week laying out how important it was that everyone put their time in  it was too late when you spent 30 minutes during this morning's all hands meeting talking about how the new people to the firm need to pull their weight    well  we could have talked about it  everything's a discussion item  i have an open door policy  funny  i didn't get the feeling it was a discussion item  what was communicated in the last three weeks was that everyone who wasn't doing the 55 hours a week  could have been 60  don't you know  and just be glad it's not 80-90 hours like  the good old days  was not meeting the expectations of the firm  doesn't feel like a discussion item   cue circular discussion about how the owner  had to put in my time when i was young and now i'm reaping the rewards  cool story  same logic as the  we shouldn't forgive student loan debt because i had to pay mine off  crowd  if your business depends on a workforce of salaried exempt people willing to work 55  hours a week  you have a bad business plan   brought this up during the interview  new boss was very clear that they work 8-6  monday through friday  except for holidays  the folks on the team have an 8-hour shift  and we rotate schedules  so someone gets 8-4  someone gets 9-5  someone gets 10-6  if you're not scheduled  you're not working  not exactly  ending work  but certainly a lot saner than my current job ,mh95ry

140,People don't listen and It is one of the biggest issue at office jobs,hello all   i have been working in it as software engineer for an enterprise solution  i have been working for almost 4 years at the same company   when you work  technical  you are never only doing technical work  you need to meet with customers to understand their requirements  provide on call support  aka hand holding  you need to remind people about processes  you have to document things  manage releases   projects  all of these are seen  normal  in it as  this is nature of the business   which means you do 2 - 3 people job but get compensated for only 1  on the other hand  what i do is generally laid back job which requires me to work for 4 hours max daily   pretty standard for office jobs as you know   anyways  the above points don't bother me so much anymore  what bothers me that  people don't listen when you provide them new information   training  i am okay to explain things couple times at the beginning but same people do keep coming up with same questions  mistakes  mistakes users do and you have to correct them as it  yes  at some point users have to take responsibility to work on the platform and there is no way to implement checkpoints everywhere  despite all of the correct ways have been shared with them by emails  training videos  ppt   examples  here you go  everyone has to create ticket for a request  no matter what  you have to create that ticket  the same people keep writing you emails that    user    can we do    my answer is always  please create ticket we can't take any actions without ticket per company policy   user    okay  thanks i will create ticket going forward   couple weeks later  guess who sends another email about new requirement without a ticket    we do provide trainings to educate people on the platform we  they supposed to use  use  there are couple rules to follow when they work on the tickets  business people do also work on the tickets in our ecosystem  yaayy team collaboration  digitalization  bs  during the training  we underline those points couple times  trainings get recorded and shared with them  on top of these  ppt is shared with them  guess what  they do the wrong things and they escalate these things to c - level as  software x is not working  the it team is not helpful etc  when we kindly explain it is user handling issue  99  of times  there is even no apologies  same applies for reporting  i mean  if you can't create reports in 2021  you should be out of the workforce  period  despite of numerous hand holding sessions with same users  they don't create reports because they don't listen to you  you could argue that  these things are included in my job  sure  but it is problematic when same people do keep coming back with same things  the job should not be policing people  they should be able to pick things up after couple explanations  the job supposed to develop and improve the platform  get familiar with vendor releases  new features    the fact that people don't listen at workplace is just adding another layer of burden of working itself,mfmmhp

192,Why so much emphasis on stress?,ever since i started university  i couldn't help but notice the big indirect emphasis on stress that's been pushed by peers   okay  lemme be more clear  i have the impression that  ever since students enter college  older students  teachers  other people  etc try to impose on the them the idea that they can only truly grow up  and have a full on college experience  if they get into a bazzilian extra curricular activities outside of their main degree  such as associativism  junior enterprises  events organizations  sports  all at the same time  and these people always claim that doing so many stuff at the same time is crucial for a huge and delightful cv  to grow as a person  and to learn how to be a better manager of one's own time  time management skills  i can't help but notice how this indirect points towards the overrating of stress  if a student has a full on college degree to complete  while having a dozen other extra curriculars full of projects to complete all at the same time  of course they're going to end up stressing out  or even burningout  i've had colleagues becoming depressed just because they felt too much pressure of being involved in so much academic stuff all while having to study for tests and assignments  yet  the majority of people at college portrays this as a good and healthy thing   i just don't get it  how can a practice that easily leads to burnout be even considered healthy  why is there so much emphasis on having to experience and live full on stress  why is it so weird to only want to go to university and complete a degree without having to be stressed with side compromises  and wanting to simply live a relaxed life  why can't people just take things gradually and at their own pace    i fail to understand why being stressed is portrayed as a positive and necessary experience to go through in order to be an adult  when it can quite literally make you unhealthy  both physically and mentally    and i'm posting this here because i guess this pressure of having to be stressed and having to have multiple stuff to do at the same time carries on from college to the workplace  seeing how in college they relate these activities so much to building a  decent  cv   ps  i already completed a bachelor's degree  and i'am on my way to finish my master's  and never once got into these extra curricular compromises  just went to watch some lectures and workshops from time to time  when i deemed them as interesting  nothing more  i'd rather prioritize my wellbeing than doing something just because everyone at college age is doing it ,mereer
193,Working nowadays seems pointless,nowadays the majority of the companies in the private sector only do pointless products or services  and that at best  at worst they directly harm others   why the f k would i want to work at a software company  making software for another large corporation to help it get that extra tiny bit milion dolar profit  i literally had a gig helping to develop a system that would spy on the employees of a supermarket chain so they won't steal from the shop  no not the clients  the minimum wage employees   why the heck would i want to work at a lawfirm or in accounting and help large corporations evade taxes  and who would want to work as a cook for mcdonalds   how can i have any fricking motivation to get a job when the end result will be pointless and purposeles   how can people get through full life of 8 hour work days and not kill themselves    this subreddit helped me through my last 2 weeks of work so thank you ,mfap8q

195,"I don't necessarily hate my job, but the lack of resources is starting to frustrate me.",don't know if this is the right place really  but i'm starting to get kind of annoyed with my boss asking things of me  which i feel like were never explained to me and aren't easily understood via documentation  this is my first job out of college and at first  i thought it seemed normal enough  i haven't had a lot of hands on experience in the real world so makes sense that i'd be uncomfortable with the majority of my work  now it's been like 5 months and idk  things aren't really getting better  i get assigned tickets and a lot of the time i have no idea what they are even talking about so i need to get ahold of someone to explain and help me through it  this is alright  but it fills me with anxiety to constantly need help  there was training the first few weeks  but i feel like not a lot was retained and of the things i retained  a lot of is not useful  they are just these prepackaged videos with no specifics to the company    the other job i do is very repetitive  same steps everyday and i honestly enjoy that way more  just no room to fuck up really    on the plus side  i work from home and no one  yet  has made comment on the amount of work getting done  although i feel like at some point  they have to  not really sure what to do  don't want to quit because finding another job feels like it will be impossible  but also am i really supposed to reach out individuals every day to get help to do my job    idk if i even like it anymore  i feel like every job is going to be rehash of this  so my options appear to be stick it out or die ,mftyqv

198,i didn’t understand how working harder without getting payed more worked until now,i work retail  store manager  sm  quit and left the co-manager  cm  and me high and dry as after she left there were only three people who could open and close  this led to me essentially taking over the cm s position and her acting as sm without a raise or change in pay  i was okay with this because cm and i get along great and i had fun working with her  well the company hired an outsider as the sm s replacement and immediately furloughed cm the same day  now i  a part-time employee  full time student  am essentially a co manager with the same pay as other key holders who don t do half of what i do  to  thank  me my new sm gave me a fucking  10 gift card to starbucks  i ve been tearing my hair out trying to fix her mistakes and to help train the new key holders she promoted while also being the person that both she and every other employee goes to for help and i don t even make  10 an hour  i am so emotionally and physically exhausted trying to keep our store from failing and all i get is  9 88 an hour  pre tax  and a motherfucking  10 gift card   this is to say that it happened slowly  i didn t realize that i had been taking on more work  i was having fun  taking care of a store with a friend and then all of a sudden i am the person that everyone goes to  need receipt tape  in the office  need to put together the vacuum  diorstars can do it  it s such a slow boil that it took my boss saying she relies on me and me having so many more responsibilities than people getting paid the same as me to realize that i m being scammed  and i m not happy about it ,mfgi6z

217,My (limited) experience with work.,i've been working for  admittedly not a very long time  i'm 24 currently  and had my first job at around 16  i've only had a few jobs in between  most of my work has been physical labor  i started as a construction aide  moved to a cashier   salesperson at a few jobs  and have been a mechanic for the last 5 years or so  almost everyone i have worked with in the industry  is depressed to all shit  they tell me to leave the industry as fast as i can  that if they could start over  they would never do mechanic work  they wouldn't tell their kids to do it  one of my co-workers would do hard drugs at work like meth and cocaine to make it bearable  my next co-worker was a raging alcoholic  to such a point where he missed work because he was drunk all the time  my next co-worker  who is also currently my friend   manager  is 32  he's balding  smokes several cigarettes a day  usually within minutes of each other  and drinks frequently  he has a lot of money  but he practically lives in the shop  i've known him to sleep in the couch in the employee room  what kind of fucking life is that  he has an old  yellowed refrigerator with a bottle of rum and ginger ale  he orders all his food online or picks it up from the closest fast food chain  he sleeps on the couch   floor in a sleeping bag at work  the most fun i've seen him have is when he'll bring his xbox or playstation to the shop and hook it up to a decade old flat screen so he can play some call of duty on an office chair in the employee room for a few hours  what the fuck kind of life is that  he works 8am - 6pmish every fucking day  i think even sundays sometimes  he spends more time at the shop than he does at home  he cheated on his wife so often that they divorced  i mean honestly  why would i want to subject myself to this shit   and my dad too  he's so full of love for work that his love is directly conditional on if i go to work or not  i can't even talk to him without him asking me if i'm going to work soon or what my next job is going to be  literally  i can walk into the room and be like  man my head really hurts today  and he'd be like  you know why  it's cause you don't work  brain is shutting down because of the lack of work stimuli   i don't want to slave away for decades and decades so i can afford to buy things that i'll never fucking use because i'm too busy working ,mfin60

225,How to stop work issued laptop going idle?,hi folks   so up until recently myself and a few colleagues have been using long youtube videos to stop our work-issued laptops from locking themselves and showing us as away on skype  we also used the other popular loophole where we could open notepad and weigh down the space bar key to keep the laptop active  the end result was we'd have all our work finished by 12 and then be able to have the rest of the day to ourselves  everyone's happy right    well clearly someone twigged what was happening  and a recent software update across all laptops has made it so that neither of those methods work any more  the video and notepad tricks have stopped working  the laptop will lock and show us as away if we're inactive for 10 minutes  screensaver settings are greyed out  so we can't change that at all  i've tried a  vbs script as well  but that's also restricted on these laptops  i'm getting pretty annoyed    does anyone know a way we can stop the laptop from locking automatically  bear in mind i don't want to install any software or extensions on a corporate laptop  i'm not even sure i'd be able to if i can't even run a custom script  i've seen you can buy a usb attachment from amazon that automatically moves the cursor every few seconds but i don't know if that'd even work at this point    thanks and hope you're all staying safe ,mex7ng

230,"The US is a totalitarian dictatorship, it's just the oppression is outsourced to employers",i was listening to a podcast about the former ddr  east germany  in their jobs  east german workers really had power and  freedom  you could vote to fire your boss  if you boss is corrupt  you could let the authorities know and they'd investigate  and if they were found to be corrupt  they were gone  you had a very significant say in how things were run  there was real democracy in the workplace  and everyone had a right to a job  this was enshrined in their constitution  so you didn't have to live the constant precariousness of losing your job  all pretty typical more or less of most socialist countries   now in the us  your boss has total control over your life  the type of control that you employer has  it's on the level of the worst dictatorships  you can't say shit to your boss  every single interaction has the potential to ruin your life  you have no say in how things are run  you have to do everything you boss says  you say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing  you lose your job  and in the us  since we have so little social protections  losing your job can lead to a whole lot of bad things  up to losing your life  and this is true of employers collectively  you get fired or have bosses that won't give you good references  finding a new job is so much more difficult  so if you don't play the game by their rules  no only can you lose your job but the system makes it all that much harder to recover and get another one   i reject the idea that you have to decide between the two  but if i had to decide between having democracy in my workplace or democracy in my political system  i'll go with workplace democracy  not like the us has political democracy  anyway ,mf47h7

265,I just wanna say that I love this sub.,hi everyone  serendipity brought me here a few days ago    i had no idea that such a magical place existed  this idea is such a radical one  i literally thought  no exaggeration  that my husband an i were the only ones  we've been living antiwork  although too ashamed to utter it  for two decades  reading many of the comments in here makes my heart soar because it could have been written by me twenty years ago  ten years ago  what a wonderful place that we're so fortunate to have  i'm so elated to have you all to connect with  i've never uttered most of these things to other humans outside of my marriage ,mf4w8v

268,Was there a turning point in history or technology that made work shitty?,my elderly uncle talked fondly about his career in the usa from about 1950-1990 and mentioned that the whole office would shut down for 2 weeks every christmastime  i was like wtf   are there any events in the late 20th century that can be seen as a direct connection to the shittiness of employment today or was it lots of gradual changes collectively  was it the rise of computer technology turning people into half-robot wage slaves   i know historically work was always shitty for the poorest parts of the population to the point of actual slavery and indiscriminate death on the job  but when did it go wrong in the modern way it is today ,mf7pp3
269,Questions About Anti Work Itself,so i might be stupid  but i m kinda extremely confused about the anti work idea as a whole  for starters  how can a work free world actually be achieved  because you literally can t have any modern society without someone or something working  you just can t  someone has to make the food  someone has to clean the houses  someone has to fly the planes  you have to have a group of people working to keep society afloat  and right now  that s basically everyone  the work gets spread fairly evenly among the common populous so everyone contributes to society but also can do their own things  but if there s just this huge fraction of the population  if not everyone  who doesn t have to do any work  then who does  robots  nope  almost all normal jobs require a modest amount of intelligent thinking  so to create a huge workforce of intelligent robots to do all of our work would immediately result in terminator  and i m serious  maybe a fraction of the human population could do work  so that way the other could live without work  gonna have to pass on that cause that sounds waaaaaay to much like having a giant army of slaves  and that is you know  morally and objectively evil and classist  but beyond the logistics of having a work free world  just the idea is practically unthinkable  work gives people extremely valuable experiences and lifelong virtues that can make them ten times the person they were before  and yeah i ll give you the fact that not all good traits in a person come from working  but when it comes to actually doing something with your life and making a living  those traits achieved from working are more valuable than gold  so yeah  maybe sitting on your ass all your life might seem pretty nice  but when you take two seconds to look at it  a work free world is not only logistically impossible  but also morally evil and corrupt ,meqsde

317,I really want to just end it all.,i feel like there is no hope for me to live a happy life  everything is too expensive  and after college i won't be making enough to live even slightly comfortably  i quit my last job because my anger grew so much while working there  i left on the spot in the middle of my shift  i have anger issues  and i think that will plague me for the rest of my life  making jobs that i normally would find boring and annoying into something that makes hate and rage fester inside me  work is hell  having to pay bills is hell  and my anxiety is still through the roof for me despite fact that i'm unemployed and don't have worry about paying bills  i really don't see a future for myself  so i wish i had the courage to end it ,m5t6uc

322,How to make employees quit their job without having to fire them,let s face it  no ceo or manager likes to fire people  at the least it s uncomfortable and in other circumstances  it can be downright emotional  employees have their bills to pay and often families to support and rarely take kindly to losing their livelihood  managers frequently face a whole host of undesirable issues when firing employees  from dramatic scenes in the office to even being sued for dismissals  these complications take up valuable time and resources   which you could be spending elsewhere in your business   but don t give up  there is a solution  i m about to share with you the way one innovative company has figured out how to get employees to resign on their own so they can avoid the stress of  letting them go  simply repeat the steps from the method i will describe to you and see your business flourish as you get rid of employees hassle-free   let s dive right in   in 2007 i started working for a big australian engineering company in perth  australia  this company had about 8000 employees spread across over 50 offices around the globe  the headquarters were located in cbd on adelaide terrace and my department was on the 8th floor  now this company had a great slogan    people  clients  management  in an internal pr move i m sure will be familiar to many of you  this company had an induction program where employees were told they were the biggest assets of the company and every success the company enjoyed was built on a foundation of mutual respect   after about 8 months with the company  i received my first performance report and it was excellent  then one day the section manager was promoted to department manager and was replaced by a relative of the branch manager  it became clear pretty quickly that the new manager did not like me   to put it mildly  over the next few months  he would make derogatory remarks about me and especially my appearance   this got progressively more intense until one day  on the way to a client  he threatened to kill me  i decided to go to hr   now i know what you re thinking  this is the part where things get tedious   with endless rounds of politically correct hr people having meetings and trying to iron out difficulties  things that are a pain for many companies not interested in  problem  employees   but stick with me  you re going to like where this goes  i promise   the hr manager  a guy by the name of todd  reacted with surprise to my complaint  informing me that everyone had a high opinion of this man and i was the first one to complain  i knew this was not true and other colleagues had also complained before me   but i kept quiet and todd promised to investigate   after a week i had heard nothing from him  then the new manager who i d complained about saw me in the corridor and told me   i heard you went to hr  i fucking hate snitches  i went straight to todd again  he said   there s not much i can do  he s a close relative of the branch manager   so i talked to the branch manager and he said i should quit if i didn t like it there  i reminded him of the slogan of the company   client  people  management  but i got nowhere  i decided to file an official complaint and todd said he would do that with me next day  in the morning todd told me that if i still wanted to file an official complaint  some things were going to change in my work routine  i said i didn t understand what he meant  to which he replied i would find out the next day  i filed the complaint   now  thank you for sticking with me and continuing to read  here s the part you ve been waiting for   introducing   the glass room quitting method  tm  the next morning todd came to my desk and said management wanted to relocate me to another desk  the 8th floor where we worked from was an open space area with 1 5 m high cubicles  it had three meeting rooms  two large and one small  full glazed one in the middle of the office floor  the small meeting room was about 3m x 3m  in it was a table  four chairs  and a phone   todd asked me to follow him  when i started packing my workstation  pens and other stuff he said   leave everything here  just come with me   we went to the small meeting room  he took three chairs out and left the last one then asked me to sit down  then he said  from now on you will work from here  you will wait until your manager comes and tells you what to do  he left the room  taking the phone as he went   so  there i was   sitting in a completely empty  fully glazed room  at an empty table  of course  the manager never came to tell me what i was supposed to do  i just sat there  hour after hour  with nothing to do but be bored and humiliated   todd would come in every morning and ask me if i wanted to resign  when i said no  he simply said i would have to continue to sit there and wait till the manager came and told me what to do   this went on for a week and i slowly started feeling like i was going crazy  i sat every day in the fully transparent glass room like a monkey in the zoo having nothing to do  you might wonder if my colleagues said anything about it  later  i was told that they had received an email saying i was going to work from the meeting room on a project for a new client  they  of course  knew that wasn t exactly right and something was wrong  but fear or embarrassment and not wanting to rock the boat meant they simply kept their heads down and busied about doing their tasks  trying not to look at me   the week after i decided to go to a lawyer   you might be worried now that this ingenious solution would reach a sticking point here and the company would be forced to stop treating me this way  but think again   i was told that from a legal point of view the company was not doing anything wrong  if they simply fired me  i would have a case  but as long as they didn t  i had no chance  so i resigned   some weeks later i met an older ex-colleague of mine by chance in a cafe  he had worked for the company for over ten years  he told me the  glass room  method was common there  he remembered that the longest someone managed to sit there and do nothing was three weeks till he willingly resigned   so there you have it  the  glass room  method for getting your employees to quit so you don t have to go to the trouble of firing them

323,Kicking the caffeine habit to get back at work,anyone else going through this   i realized that as much as i like the feeling of coffee as a recreational drug  energy fiend  what the daily coffee addiction basically amounts to is a push for me to take a stimulant in order to be more productive  provide additional surplus labor  for my job   it's very obvious that this is why a lot of companies provide this stimulant for free   however  there seems to also be a worrying amount of corporate meddling in scientific health research in the english speaking world  not only because big coffee is a huge lobby in its own right  but because it is the cornerstone of industrialized grind culture   while it definitely doesn't seem to be as damaging as smoking  there are similarities in the commercialization of the scientific research  lots of nonsense around a narrative of  it has negative effects but is fine in small doses  also it nurses a habitual dependency but if you fall for that you're just a moron   simply put  caffeine probably won't give you fairy cancer or lupus or some other secret scary disease we're all secretly getting   all we need to do is observe what it does to us when we take it  it can make us hyperactive  it raises stress  and stress over long periods of time is extremely dangerous  leading to hypertension high blood pressure and eventually heart disease    not being sleepy at work  ain't worth my heart   now if you'll excuse me  i'll be taking a nap in the bathroom ,m5rma8

327,Math ability has excessive control over determining People's fate,i see a lot of people who seem to have a desire to change math  as in to make it more vague and less definitive so as to give a leg up to people with less ability in that realm  i personally am not sure about the long term viability of this idea  but what i am confident in is my belief that we need new  avenues  for people  it seems to me that if somebody is really bad at math  then this might have a large effect in terms of determining their eventual economic status  the perception of their overall intelligence as opposed to simply mathematics intelligence  a certain  kind  of brain power  etc    what i'm not asking is that we corrupt math  do away with it  or relegate it in a way that excessively messes with it as an avenue for the people who do have ability  for example people like terence tao who are brilliant and deserve their careers in math  not to mention people who might not be at his level but certainly deserve their career or their respect  but i definitely think we need to expand into a system where sucking at math  or a particular topic in general  doesn't necessarily mean somebody is lower status  set to be lower income  or considered foolish    obviously this is very much an idealist's concept  but i really think it's a fair one  there are infinite forms of intelligence and humanity simply needs to keep developing and using their creativity to find new ways to ascertain the value that lies within people  uncover avenues where people who previously weren't going to be discovered or able to excel  will be  thanks for reading ,m5hrdr

332,"Quit my Big Tech job 6 weeks ago, best decision I've made in a really long time.",i love this sub  it has carried me through the last few months at work while i was waiting for our yearly bonus before quitting  i wanted to maximize the amount of   i could pocket from this job before quitting  but the last few months it was really hard to pretend i cared    from my experience  big tech jobs are golden handcuffs in that they throw tons of money at you in exchange for getting you to spend your own limited amount of time on this planet working on completely useless  at best  products  surrounded by tech bros  while execs play political games and throw money at the wall to see what sticks  it pays well  and has enabled me to get to the point where i'm comfortable quitting financially  but it's soul-sucking  when i realized i was crying every monday at the prospect of another week of pointless video calls  about a product that shouldn't be made  in corporate bullshit language full of acronyms and words like  net-net   paradigm shift  and  pow-wow   for some reason the  progressive  tech industry still thinks it's ok to use this word  i knew it was time to go    i am extremely lucky in that my partner happens to be a freelance artist whose business has been steadily growing for the past few years  it recently reached the point where he started needing extra help  and so we worked out how he could start employing me to help him  i very excited  as i have been following his business journey from day 1 with all its interesting challenges that i helped him problem solve  i love what he does  i want to see him make more art  and so i'm very excited to free up time for him by taking on more of the administrative tasks of running a business so he has more creative time  i am of course taking a big pay cut compared to what big tech offers  but i really couldn't care less  he pays me a reasonable living wage and the amount of joy i am now able to derive from choosing what i do with my time every single day is priceless  i feel like my skills are perfectly complementary to his  and i am now able to use them on a project i am passionate about  my last day was february 1st and i will never look back    it feels so natural to wake up and do what i want without worrying about what time it is  what people that have  power  on me might want from me  what appearances i need to maintain to fit in  i am still in awe at how long i convinced myself to stay at this job industry for the past several years  bonding with colleagues over crying in empty meeting rooms or drinking ourselves blind enough to talk about and process the soft misogyny we were all experiencing  i feel a million times more productive even though i  work  less than 15 hours a week  the rest of the time  i cook  i have started spending time doing art myself  i look forward to volunteering to get involved in my community  i learn new skills  i prepare my garden for spring  i work on the house  etc  i can go to shops in the middle of the day and stop by to chat with a friend  then work on our business until 10pm if that's when i'm feeling productive  it's truly wonderful and i wanted to share the joy with this community  as it has really made me feel less alone in my hatred of corporate culture and bullshit jobs ,m6om4g

354,The Rise of Antiwork Sentiment Reveals the Truth: Work is a Prison, disneyland is there to conceal the fact that it is the  real  country  all of  real  america  which is disneyland  just as prisons are there to conceal the fact that it is the social in its entirety  in its banal omnipresence  which is carceral  - baudrillard  i've been thinking a lot about the past year and a sinking feeling in my gut that was revealed as the bread and circuses dried up   almost a year of isolation and the old world just feels unreal  if i had told my younger self that this was 2020 i would not have been able to convince myself   before 2020 we may have been able to distract ourselves from what is the true reality  the reality of diseases and systemic control  racism  misogyny  classism  etc  and scientific warnings of collapse   we were able to wrap ourselves in a warm blanket of  stable employment  and retirement plans  and health insurance  and a media landscape where we saw good people reflecting our values coming out on top   even those of us who were economically poor or struggling could look forward to a day off  seeing family  friends  going out  getting to live in a beautiful dreamworld for moments out of the year   i remember it too  the time we spent at work could fly by in an instant  we didn't have to think about getting old  or not wasting our time or youth  because we were in a golden age  we would fall into place  and we were reassured by others of the same   the nature of work changed so rapidly and became so normalized for a lot of people that it's hard to even know exactly when it happened   it was like the crack of a whip   there is a pandemic outside  it could kill you  but you better keep your head down and keep working   for a lot of people this realization comes to them individually  when they are fired for a work injury  or for taking off too much time to grieve a family member  but this time it came to people collectively   you are now an essential worker  you wouldn't want to starve your friends and family  would you   your medical knowhow is crucial at this point   you wouldn't want people to die from your inaction   working from home is beneficial for mitigating risk  but we've made the hard decision to have our employees keep coming in for the sake of the company's productivity   like the butt of rifle with a smileyface sticker on it   if you hadn't woken up before 2020 you're probably wide awake now to the truth   maybe not enough to actually resist or take action yet  no  but it's obvious   work is a prison  and every exit you see is just another wing ,m6gixa

371,"DISCUSSION: What is a better question for ""So what do you do for a living?""",  the setup  our jobs and careers consume a large part of both our day and our lives so asking someone  what do you do for a living  is a shorthand for gauging not just your financial stability but also insight into who you are as a person if said job or its industry is what you would be doing for the remainder of your working life  you identify with your job  asking  so what do you do for a living  helps identify you as a person  it's a classic icebreaker question for getting to know someone   only after the person answering the question has passed  i e  has a stable job income and is happy in that job  meaning it's  sustainable  not that your happiness is a requirement to theirs  does the person who asked the question  ask additional questions related to who you really are as a person e g  your emotions  your thoughts  your passions  your history  your family  your culture  your dreams  your hang-ups  your problems  all the questions related to getting to know one another and join two lives  in other words  if you're prospectable  then you're pursued  we all do this     the scenario  but if your job is without dignity  not making you happy  not generating enough income  and generally all-around  unsustainable  and you therefore choose not to identify with it outside of your job  e g  i may be a mcdonald's worker but i dj outside out that  then what becomes a better question to ask a person in such a situation  is it    so what do you do for a living   lt   answers career job   lt  normal questions   so what do you do for a living   lt   answers poorly prospectable job  like mcdonalds     lt       is it a follow up question like  oh do you do anything outside of that   or is there a superior question to start with  that isn't so personal right off the bat like   so who are you as a person  what are your problems with your father  tell me about your deepest troubles and dreams ,meklv6

373,Essential Employees should have unionized at the start.,i've been working this pandemic since the beginning like most of you  and like majority of front line workers  we would have    1  made more money on unemployment benefits cares act bonus 2  had leisure time or time to improve our lives 3  make passive income and focus on things that truly matter to us  4  not be exposed to the virus so deadly we had to shut down an entire global economy   the problem i saw was that not too many essential employees were unionizing  i have met 0 essential employees in my area willing to step up towards there employer  or employers willing to step up for there employees  there is a big problem when those on unemployment benefits are making substantially more than those working  but i am not here to argue that because wage workers tend to be underpaid to begin with as a whole   as an essential employee full time student i would have benefited heavily from being laid off  but i was forced to work  i have elderly at home who i take care of and obligations towards my education along with work  i would have made more on the unemployment benefits    i just wish people stopped pretending like they care about frontline workers and told them how it is  you got screwed  that's all ,m6pntq

383,Has anyone here actually achieved the goal of quitting working (for others) completely?,i know there's literally millions of us disgusted with contemporary work culture  but somewhere within that huge number there has to be at least a certain micro-percentage of those who really succeeded in quitting work  be it through the vagabond lifestyle  self-sufficiency  early retirement  pure luck or whatever other reason   what are your stories  what can we learn from you  and how did your life change   i know such things are unimaginable for most people in the usa  but in some of the more generous social democracies in europe - there's got to be a way  right   i would love if we could hear these kinds of stories more  the  truly  inspiring ones  if you escaped the system by your own cunning  of course  and not by exploiting others   i have achieved this kind of change recently and my life literally turned upside down  on the other hand  each day is a struggle since it is probably the most unpredictable kind of existence for those who achieve it without amassing huge savings   one unexpected consequence is the painful alienation i often feel  don't get me wrong  i realize that literally the majority of the planet yearns for such a lifestyle and i wouldn't trade it for anything  but  predictably  my relationships with people who do not live the same way have fallen apart even more than they do by themselves once you are out of school   if you are not comfortable sharing your experiences publicly or prefer one-on-one communication for whatever reason  feel free to dm me too  as i would love to meet people who took a path similar to mine   i also feel a kind of  survivor guilt  sometimes and i feel like i should be doing more to help others achieve the same  but i literally have no idea how ,m6ewz2

Sorry it’s kinda long.,soooo awhile back i found this and at first thought it was just a funny subreddit and followed  then everything posted started really making sense and hitting home  then someone made a post about how when we work all the time and tell ourselves and our kids we are doing it for them all we are doing is creating a cycle where they will do the same thing  i started thinking to my parents and grandparents who worked themselves crazy providing for us and telling us kids it was for a better life    it made me really start thinking about it all  and made me want to end that cycle  i work four days a week and being a single dad  i have to rely on my mom to get my two kids to and from school  i was gone 14  hours a day  i drive an hour each way in order to make good money  my kids aren t needy and would rather spend time with me than buy anything  i told myself it was necessary in order to give them a good life  i also have a carpentry business i do on the weekends  i ve been moving to self sufficiency on my small farm and even making a bit of money from that  in other words i worked a lot    that ended today  i took a job that is 5 minutes from the house  i will make half the pay i was making  but my kids will get to stay at home every night instead of grandmas house  i will get to drop them off every day  i will budget like i ve been doing  i ve saved enough to pay off my car which is a modest car anyway  i ll be able to use my extra time to make this small farm pay for itself  with the kids help  so i ll only take carpentry jobs i wanna take that the kids can help with  i m ending the cycle and i m so freaking excited  my kids will remember time with me  not how much i worked  so thank you for opening my eyes that my worth isn t tied to how much money i make random people of reddit ,m3vrbh

401,Can you guys explain the theory of this sub,i m a little confused as to what you guys are advocating  is this a socialism  or communism  or what is this  because  any economic system  people have to work   don t get me wrong  i m all for abolishing the 9-5 and a healthy work life balance  i m just not sure what this movement advocates for,m4m8xh
402,The system is slavery and nothing will change unless people accept that.,when was there every an option to  opt-out  people look at me and laugh at me or pitty me as some kind of bum who doesn't want to work because he is too lazy and it frustrates the crap out of me  people think slavery was abolished years ago but it never was  since when did we have a choice to be part of this system  we are born   slapped with a name  sent to school to learn how to be a good cog  told to work until we are old and broken  where is the choice in any of that        oh but you can escape the system    yeah if you have tonnes of money  i often honestly tell myself that i wish i had never been born into this era  i would much rather have been a hunter gatherer with my family all around me in a tribe struggling to live from day to day rather than working for the man who has no idea what it is like at the bottom of society and continues to use me and abuse me every single day       people need to realise it is slavery  sure some people escape the bottom classes but only the very lucky ones and their success stories are dangled tantalizingly infront of people to give them unrealistic hope that they may one day do the same  dangling a carrot before a donkey until the donkey gives out and they get another donkey       why just because i was born to a lowerclass family is my fate to work myself into an early grave for people at the top who couldn't even care less about me  nothing is going to change unless the people who have been indoctrinated into thinking this is normal wake the f up ,m495qy

404,The weekend is a lie,by that i mean  you barely get one  so we probably all know the high of quitting time on friday and a lot of us probably think the two days for the weekend is not long enough  so saturday comes  maybe you went to sleep later because there was no work the next day  or you woke up later for the same reason  but you've got to go buy food  prepare for the coming week  and because everyone else is also at the shops on the same day  you wind up losing the middle of your day  then you realise your saturday is mostly gone  you still have laundry to do  chores etc  then it's sunday  you know you've got to get to bed early  because of monday  maybe you've got ironing to do  lunches to prepare for the week so that's less time to do your own thing  then add in  how your time might get used up if you have children and that's your weekend gone   i was just thinking this today  but  yeah  the weekend is too short,m4axz2

406,"14 hour shifts, no OT pay, NO breaks, unsafe toxic environment but I'm too scared to quit.",i recently started a job  1 5 months ago  as a manager of a  legal  dispensary  i was referred by a mutual friend of ours and he's said from the beginning he wouldn't hire anyone else but me  since i have experience in this industry  since we opened during lockdown we have been very slow  so he  vp of ops who is working in the store with me for the time being  decided it would be best to not hire anyone and split the work between us  this meant 3 of days i was working alone for 11 hours  and the other 2 days i would be working 7 hours  i agreed to this for the time being because i thought it was manageable and because i didn't want to cause an issue  to be honest  it has been a little difficult working the long 11 hour shifts alone with no break  but i managed   now that we are out of lockdown  we are able to stay open 9am-11pm  i was under the impression that we would be hiring 2 more people to allow us to work a normal schedule but when i spoke to him last week he suggested that we work 5 regular days  7 8 hours  1 14 hour day and have 1 day off instead of hiring more staff  i already decided prior that i would not be willing to work this schedule because i knew he would suggest this  when he suggested that to me last week i told him that i don't want either of us to work those hours  but it was a boundary for me and that i would prefer not to  keep in mind that i did not get paid overtime for the previous ot i worked  nor would i get paid for the additional hours with the new proposed schedule  this means either  i do work the proposed schedule or i work 7 days a week and i'm not really comfortable with either   he spent the next 10 minutes being upset with me and trying to convince me that working the long week wasn't so bad  which then made me feel like maybe i was overreacting    since then he said he wants to hire another staff member at the end of the month  but to be honest i'm not sure if i trust him  i had the perfect candidate for the job and when i suggested that we hire him before we increase our hours he brushed it off the 2 separate times saying we'll wait a bit longer before we hire him until the candidate was no longer available  so i'm not sure if he actually wants to hire more people or just is tiding me over  regardless  i've already worked this schedule for a week and i don't want to do it anymore  even if i wouldn't have to do it in 2 weeks  the fact that he expected me to work this schedule  got upset with me when i said no  and then i was somehow guilted into doing it doesn't sit well with me    on top of this  my anxiety has been the worst it's been in my life  on 2 occasions i thought about taking myself to the hospital  and on 1 occasion i called an ambulance  i don't think it's a coincidence that this started when i started this job  my problem is that since it's only him and i  i'm really screwing him over by quitting and i feel absolutely terrible to put him in this position  i'm going to offer to stay another week and help him find a replacement but like he said  he wouldn't want to hire anyone and train anyone else for this job  he has no clue i want to quit so i'm in a really shitty spot  and i'm going to put him in an even shittier one  i know i shouldn't care since he's clearly shown he doesn't care for me or my wellbeing but i just feel so awful about it  i want to do this tomorrow so it lines up with the pay cycle and i'll receive one last pay cheque but i feel sick to my stomach about doing it    tl dr employer is giving me 2 schedule options i'm unhappy with  either work 7 days a week  or work 60 hours a week with 1 day off  not sure if i'm being dramatic or if this is a boundary i am justified in upholding and quitting ,m58qcc
407,The hypocrisy of companies offering extra health and wellness webinars during the pandemic without systemically changing anything else is amazing (in a bad way),of course there are plenty of things both before and during the pandemic that has gotten worse on us workers  but one thing that has really stood out has been the company i work for offering extra optional health and wellness webinars focused on covid  what amazes me  in the worst way possible  is that these sessions like  managing stress during the pandemic  type sessions are nice to offer  sure  but they're ridiculously performative  absolutely nothing will reduce employee's stress and improve our mental health if you don't reduce our hours and workload  lower expectations  stop firing a bunch of people  etc  it really does amaze me that companies think they can boost everyone's health just by offering a few extra webinars  it's like putting one single band aid on a gunshot wound  we so clearly need massive change  in my opinion a reduction of the 40 hour work week is a start - and a realistic and reasonable one at that  i'm just so frustrated that i keep seeing these sessions offered  and i do attend them  and all they do is make me angrier  the good thing is the ones leading the webinars usually send out follow up surveys  so i at least get to write in my thoughts afterwards  but really  i don't see change in my own company  and i've had enough ,m56y80

413,"I dislike my job, how do I make my boss as miserable as possible?",so  i can't stand my workplace  my coworkers are pissed because i am allowed to work from home and they are not and it has caused a big shit storm  my boss has been doing subtle little jabs to guilt me to coming back into the office and coworkers are giving me the cold shoulder '  my boss attempted to piss me off today  i did a project for him earlier this week  he said that it was good  but not what his manager was looking for  he then requested that i give it another go  i pissed him off by saying sure  i would be happy to give it as many shots as possible for the team  i think this annoyed him more because he expected me to be an asshole so he could use it against me   i made sure to document our conversation by sending him an  email  outlining his request making sure i understood his full expectations    i already did  but just wanted to create a paper trail since he called    i can tell he is frustrated with me  what are other ways i can subtly piss him off without being fired right away  lol   he also tends to be annoyed when he sends me  a long email and a respond with one word ,m3uajj
414,My SO is a slave of his workplace and I'm about to lose it.,currently waiting for him to come home after a 9hour shift that was originally 7hours long  but became 9 because they didn't hire enough people and force their employee to do overtime  we have to do a lot of stuff today and we're running late because of this  the worst part is that his coworkers are all like this  that workplace is built on explotation and people who are so eager to please their management that are willing to start their shift 2 hours earlier any morning and stay there until the work it's done  this would probably be removed as it's only a rant and doesn't offer much to the conversation  but it's fine  i needed to rant and there's no place better than this to do it  most of the people i speak to tell me it's is job and he's doing the right thing if he want to keep it ,m47psm

418,"I love to work, but....",this will be a big one  but bear with me   for the last 5 years i have worked in one of the largest european multinational companies in an engineering job  my job consists basically in designing new products for the automotive market and in the paper this is one of those fulfilling jobs where you get to make the difference    the problem  as with most jobs  is in the execution  first of all  i am not native to the original country of the multinational  many of you should know that  by definition  my career and job climbing is limited by nothing else than my own nationality  this is a known secret in all  multinational  companies that in fact have nothing multinational about them except promoting the use of cheap labor in other countries    this meant i could never ascend to the top ranking inside the company  which to be honest was not my goal  but this also meant that my opinion  even if highly back by proofs  calculations  simulations and reasoning will be  in the best case  head to head with the native s heart-felted belief  and that is not how science or engineering really should work    the second problem is the local environment in which i work  the local bosses  and the full local hierarchy  are nothing else but patsies that don t even dream the rise above the limitations imbued in their brains the central headquarters  and  everyone which actually tries to be better  is to some extent marginalized    during the time i was there  i was one of the responsible people to win a large public financed project to foment the technology development and specialized workforce of my own country  the idea is to get these tech projects to be done in  less developed  countries so that they could close the gap the  more developed  countries using some financial and social incentives  the idea is of course amazing however  after 5 years and hundreds of people involved i feel we got nothing to show  not necessarily because the projects didn t create anything useful but because it was never about being successful  once this project ends  nothing interesting in knowledge will actually stay at my country  or even my work group  we will be back to the meat grinder of useless poorly paid jobs    and this is what led me to anti-work  most of us are either working for someone to get rich  or working for absolutely no reason whatsoever  it is not that i am against working  i love working and see my creations come to life  but i realize that the current status-quo will never enrich the society which i am part of  and that destroys me from the inside ,m4ulyx

421,being punished for not working quick enough,so for my job me and three other people unload a truck each week for our local retail chain  we range from the ages 20 to 55 and do a pretty decent job however this past week our supervisor decided that we had been failing miserably  according to her she was pissed that truck didn t get done  was pissed that even though she scheduled us the max amount of hours she could that truck still didn t get done  was pissed that she had to help us  cause apparently shes not supposed to  was pissed that we fucked up her planograms and set her back a week  all of that didn t bother me because this is a part time job for me just to pay my bills  the part that pissed me off was when she said that she would start taking disciplinary actions against us if this continued  how the hell do you take disciplinary actions against people who are trying hard  there is 3 of us who unload a whole truck and stuck everything  each truck has anywhere from 400 to 1 000  items  in the time i ve worked there  3 months  we ve maybe finished truck three times  i already hate working but this makes me hate it even more ,m4mqia

442,18 Scientific Reasons Why the Work Week Should Be Shorter,scientific reasons why  of  of should of shorter  companies are starting to ditch the 40-hour work week  he delve into the past of eight hours  five days a week and use science to tell us why working less could benefit us all               during the industrial revolution  16-hour days and six-day weeks were the norm  but people started to campaign  and formed the slogan   henry word and his motor company were the first to implement the change  and in 1926 announced the five-day work week   he've come along way since then  but perhaps change again is in the air   of blocking fewer hours  using the power of science  the impact less time at the desk could have may improve more aspects of your life than you realize         in experiment in sweden revealed that nurses who work six-hour days  took half as much sick time as nurses working eight-hour days   d  busy people often make unhealthy lifestyle choir  working less would give us time to cook a healthy  meal instead of going for fast food   productivity is higher in countries where people work fewer hours countries such as germany  who work about 1 400 hours

446,Globalism makes change harder,through history  revolutions have taken place in small groups  or as big as countries  now these groups have characteristics in common and were independent  which is why they are capable of a revolution    but nowadays  the economical system  capitalism  and neoliberalism  are all over the world  all countries are connected to each other  if one country tries to change  it can t do so without hurting its relationship with the other countries  be it importation and exportation  the transnational companies  etc    what we need is an international revolution  which is imo a lot harder than a national revolution  i think this is one of the reasons change is so hard ,m3ugaq

465,Being a transgender person in the workforce makes it so much worse, tl dr  i m being discriminated against by my horrible manager and it s got me feeling hopeless   i m new to this subreddit and also new to the job force  my parents didn t let me get a job until they were vaccinated for covid  i m an 18 year old transgender man  he him  and i m very open about that in both my application and to my coworkers  i refuse to hide my identity from people just because they think my existence is a debatable subject   maybe not the safest idea because i live in the bible belt  but whatever  trans rights bitches    i think i pass well as a guy and i m fairly well established in my workplace as a male-identified person  i work in a chain restaurant and when people approach me at the drive through they ll usually refer to me as  sir   man  or  bro  depending on who i m interacting with  i have 3 managers  we ll call them managers a  b and c  and manager a  the one who s the most tolerable  even told me one day that she told everybody in the staffing and management at the restaurant what my pronouns were and to tell her if i experienced any discrimination  manager a and b as well as most of my coworkers are very good with remembering my pronouns  but manager c  the most dickish of the managers  just won t call me by my pronouns  i have no idea why  he just constantly refers to me with  she  which does not help my dysphoria at all  manager a said she told everyone in the restaurant  c included  so there s no reason why he should be calling me by incorrect pronouns unless he s just incredibly forgetful and doesn t hear that just about everyone calls me  he  unless he s doing it intentionally  i asked manager b to tell c to stop misgendering me and she told me that it was between me and c for that discussion to happen  which i hate to think about  why should i have to ask the person in charge of everyone else for basic respect  i m also nervous that calling him out on this could result in me getting snapped at  which already happens to me a lot because manager c is horrible to the workers under him  he accuses all of us of playing around when he s not doing anything to help us during the dinner rush  snaps at me when i forget to hand out drinks  and even has the audacity to yell at me for handing out the wrong bags of food when he hands them to me and tells me which car to bring it to  needless to say it s not a conversation that i want to have or should have to have   i may be new to this subreddit but i ve known that capitalism is a fundamentally broken system for a while now  and now that i m experiencing the discrimination that i am  and i know that discrimination against me will always be present in the workplace towards me just because of how i am  it s getting me immensely depressed  i m considering filing a complaint with the higher ups at the corporate level i assume that because i m being discriminated against when the contracts i signed specifically said i wouldn t and it s a chain restaurant with more red tape to work around than an independent company then i should have at least some luck on my side but i have my doubts it ll do anything  i still live with my parents and am going to college in the fall so i don t desperately need this job  so technically i could quit any time  but i m just so tired of not having money to afford things  i want to be able to get top surgery and keep paying for my testosterone in the future  not to mention i need to have money in reserve for emergency expenses    i feel like it might look better on my resume if i stay with this job for at least 3 months  but i m already so miserable  besides that  i have other things to focus on  i m still a senior in high school and i still need to prep for college  but the truth is that even though i know that i d be happier if i quit my job  i m scared to drop it  i don t want to not be able to afford things now or in the future  and i feel like i m somewhat useless if i don t have a job at 18  i wanted a job so badly before my parents would let me get one  so it feels defeating to quit it after i ve only been there for a month  so i m at a loss  but i still have to work for 7 hours straight tomorrow  it doesn t really feel like any move i make now will be a step in the right direction ,m3yib5

471,My doctor strongly recommended bed rest and all I could think about was work 😞,i go to university full time for animation  i have a slipped disc in my spine which is causing sciatica and i also have fibromyalgia   chronic fatigue syndrome  i really need a break  i was running myself into the ground and my doctor could really see that  i m in a lot of pain so i got strong pain killers  he told to spend the next 2 weeks in bed before i get an x-ray and i freaked the fuck out  1 because my painkillers make me sleepy which makes me extremely unproductive and 2 because i knew for a fact my university would not allow me to have 2 straight weeks off and even if they did i would feel so much guilt about not working  i ended up trying to think of a  creative solution  which was to move my pc and cintiq next to my bed so i could satisfy both parties while completely ignoring what i needed and wanted    my partner told me that was insane and that i needed to take care of myself  i took a step back and realised how long it had been since i have had an actual break which has been a very  very long time  how long i had been neglecting myself  how badly i had treated myself  that i m sick  i m disabled and that i need a break  i even went to the doctor not because i needed help but because i wanted to stop the pain so i could sit down and work again because i was terrified of missing my deadlines  how screwed up is that  my student loan is my only income and i m too disabled to work a  normal  job    i still don t see a solution to my problem as of now nor am i asking for one  i just wanted to share my experience  it is rather haunting  that we are conditioned from such a young age to just run ourselves into the ground with no regard for our health and well-being  the thought that we have to earn our right to exist  it s disgusting but i don t see anything changing  this has strengthen my anti work stance even more though  i will try my best to not teach my future children this  i do not want them to determine their worth based on how productive they are ,m4d5h6

486,Are we perpetuating industries because we have no way out?,many people work in industries or at companies that don't align with their values  and these industries and companies continue thriving because people can't all just mass-quit and put them out of business    mcdonald's would have no workers if there was ubi  but because people need an entry-level job and don't have other options  they put up with working there  despite the poor employment practices    it's not easy to just pick up and leave  we're not incentivized to because there isn't much of a safety net  even if you're a whistleblower  it can be a long time before you get compensated  if they get compensated at all    if i didn't have to work  i would not care about the industry i'm in  i would focus on cleaning up the environment  helping animals  selling food  but i don't leave because these are the skills i have and i make much more money doing work i don't align with  i used to like my work  but after so many years i'm disenchanted with it    i was watching a webinar for work and imagined that the person doing the webinar cares little about what they're saying  but they say it because they're paid to do so  if we weren't forced to work for a living  it's likely webinars like that would go away because who would seriously want to do that  when they could go do something that aligns more with their values    how many industries would disappear if we weren't forced to work for a living  and how many companies that didn't treat people right would shut down because nobody would work there    i think of employees at wells fargo that opened fake accounts and forged customer signatures because they were told to meet quotas  if they didn't have to work for a living  they could more easily justify leaving  but someone who has tons of bills  and has to work  justifies doing something unethical because they need to  survive    just a rant  and another reason people shouldn't be forced to work to live ,m51mln

509,"I'm not totally 'anti-work', I'm just anti-'get fucked by every employer in every conceivable way'",i don't mind working  even jobs that are difficult or demanding  i don't mind getting dirty and i don't mind doing boring things to make a living  i've driven trucks  swept floors  ran registers  done gardening  plumbing  electrical  and even replaced septic tanks  i have never once had a problem with the job   always  the company and the people i work for    i would clean and replace septic tanks all day  every day  but never again for  10 hr  i would deal with obnoxious customers and 'karens' ten hours every single day  but not for  10 hr  i've earned my class a cdl and it's bullshit when you see all the ads saying  we pay so much  and  we're short on drivers  they want people with 0 experience  because they either hammer them into their mold or find a way to let them go  or they want people with 15  years driving and not a  single  mark on their record for anything  only the most prefect drivers make anything reasonable  my best driving job was about  700-800  take-home  every week and i didn't even qualify for insurance until i'd been with them for two years  that was for being on the road for a week at a time and only getting 2 days off every weekend  it sounds like it's decent  and it is better than minimum wage by far  but the cost of a cdl can be anywhere from  3k  what i paid  to as much as  15k depending on your location and the school you attend  you don't  need  to go to a school  but good fucking luck convincing anyone to let you borrow their truck to take the test without it    i'm just so tired of being treated like i'm worth less than the dirt on the floors i'm told to sweep for hours a day  i'm sick of being belittled and screamed at by bosses and written up when i give the attitude back  just because you sign my paycheck does not give you the right to treat me like property    i'm a human fucking being  i  want  to work  i just don't want to go in every single day and enter every single interview pretending i'm happy to earn fuck all when i know it's never going to be enough to have a 'decent' living  there simply is no 'working class' people living decent lives  decent as in a paid off home  a paid off car for each adult living there  money and the freedom in work to take vacation  able to save more than single dollars every week after expenses  being able to splurge and spoil friends or family on occasion   there are no 'working class' jobs able to support that  people tell me all the time to become a welder 'and earn  30 hr easy'  welding is hard and  where i live  welders start at  15 hr at best  you can't just 'become' a welder on a bridge  underwater  for a skyscraper  those jobs are selective and require experience even if you're in the area for those  welding  much like driving  also requires schooling  you might be able to 'prove' to some mom and pop car or fabrication shop that you're a decent welder  but they won't pay like union jobs  people act like you can just 'decide' to pick a better job and make it happen  fuck no you can't  nepotism  favoritism  and a lack of trust from management to the bottom employees always fucks over the blue collars   so i'm not anti-work  i want to work and i work hard  i just want to feel like my work is worth something no matter what that work is  if you put flowers in a vase  fuck yeah  you're valuable  i worked at a floral shop and delivered arrangements  that shit is hard to make look good and people  love  flowers  if you run a register  your work is amazing  keeping those lines moving smoothly and being able to smile  laugh with  and assist most customers is extraordinarily impressive  the people on the 'bottom' truly are essential and the backbone of society  they all deserve so much better    sorry if this rambles too much  i'm currently fighting a sinus infection  hopefully not covid  but i did get tested today  so i'll try to respond to many people who may comment  but if i don't  i apologize for my inevitable crash    tl dr  i love work  work is great  i just want to be treated like a human and paid for my work instead of an 'expendable employee' who makes the bare minimum these employers are able to pay ,m58b0q

552,My work keeps statistics on me.,     hi  i would like to rant  my work reprimanded me today  i am a customer service representative  i work my ass of for that job  while having many severe disabling physical and mental conditions that impeded my daily life         i don t want to loose my job  it is so horrible  i feel powerless because i need this job really bad  i get to work from home which helps with my disabilities  it s also hard to get a job with disabilities        they keep stats on me like i m a machine  i am monitored very closely and if i don t achieve their baseline stats on performance  i get in trouble  they like to say how awesome a company they are because you can have tattoos and colored hair  i just think that is a weird things to brag about  they literally are the  not like other girls  meme but for corporations   we aren t like other corporations  i think it is bizarre that i  as a human being  have stats  as if i were a video game character        their stats are meaningless as well  i try to build a relationship with the customer  appropriately addressing  their needs  as well as document each incident thoroughly  but the way the companies stats are designed  it makes each interaction like a never ending factory line  being rushed and messy        i want to go a good job  it s important for me to do a good job but their monitoring of me makes it impossible  i wish they would just let me do my job        by the way  i just started this job and it is entry level but i only get two weeks vacation  one week paid  and the time off doesn t fully accrue until the end of the year  i don t know if i just had better jobs in the past  but i could take off as much time as a needed  so long as it was reasonable  which only having two weeks makes it so i can t a vacation and have a disability because i have to use that time off for appointments  mental health days  and physical health days  etc    fuck work ,m2icea

559,Meet the 'faux commuters' taking fake trips to work during the pandemic,   gt before the pandemic  jesson had planned her day while on public transit   going over her to-do list  checking her calendar  and getting ready to transition into work mode   i didn t even really realize that i was prepping myself for the day until i no longer had the ability to do that  she says     gt     gt in an effort to regain the satisfying elements of her former routine  jesson began faux commuting several months ago  now  she drives about 20 minutes to a coffee shop most mornings  before her workday starts  not only does jesson s commute create a buffer between her work and personal time  but it  adds that more human aspect  back into her day     gt     gt when you re commuting  there s hundreds of people around you  so it s kind of like everyone s in it together  she says    you have all this extra free time handed back to you and you choose to use it doing unpaid work and unnecessary travel because you can't imagine an alternative ,m31fzf
560,Pick your shit sandwich,i worked part time  24-30 hrs per week  and enjoyed the most freedom and flexibility i ll probably ever have in my work life  for now at least  but i wasn t getting paid crap  i basically could only afford my essential bills and didn t have much money leftover to splurge on my hobbies like traveling  gardening  etc   now i work your typical 9-5  mon - fri office job  and get paid more than enough to splurge on my hobbies  but i don t have nearly as much wiggle room in my schedule to go on trips  visit family whenever i want  call out and have a coworker cover for me if i need a break that day  etc   so i guess my point is a lot of us can t have the best of both worlds  our system isn t set up to allow people to live comfortably working part-time hours  unless you re lucky enough to not have debt  have the support of family friends  etc  we either have to resort to living paycheck to paycheck  constantly stressing about money but having more free time or having way less leisure time but not really worrying about money so i guess you have to prioritize and pick your shit sandwich   this made me realize 2 things    1  if you work full time and don t have the option to go part time  spoil the shit out of yourself  if you love to travel  don t wait for your company to grant you that stingy ass 1-2 week vacation  take weekend trips  days trips  etc  do it all  i see a lot of posts here saying that people don t have the energy to do anything after work  trust me i get it  on top of having depression  it feels nearly impossible sometimes to even have the motivation to do things i enjoy  but how i see it is  if i don t take time for myself  then i let capitalism and corporate employers steal the most significant years of my life and you can never get that time back  so stop waiting and get on the plane  go out to a new restaurant  go to a damn spa just because you deserve it  just do something   2  if you work part time  companies are still stingy asf with their pay so put in minimal effort for that minimal pay  save your energy for the extra days you have off work to actually enjoy life off the clock ,m2y6d9
561,I get paid less for working overtime than I do for working normal time!,so this is actually the law where i live  the law here is that overtime pay must be at  minimum  minimum wage and a half  it's written down in inarguable english  now i've heard through word of mouth a lot of companies don't choose to do as little as possible for their employees and a lot of places will give you more for overtime  imagine that  3 guesses what my fuck off little fuck company does  today i worked 7 30am - 11 00pm  after 5 i was making less money   sorry i just need to rant about work  i love you guys  fuck work   also  before anyone says  at least you're beating minimum wage  yeah well i'm 29 and live in my parent's basement because the cost of living is too high  they tell me to get a girlfriend  super easy when you're 29 and live in your parents basement ,m2hwrv

565,I walked out today,i live in the u k and for the past year i've dragged myself to the led lit hell that is asda our walmart equivalent  the sheer amount of work and stress i've been under has finally become all too much  it has been both physically and mentally exhausting for me and i'm fed up of putting my life at risk because the public can't social distance or wear a mask properly  if they even wear it at all    i worked on the home shopping department that delivers people's online grocery orders and since i started it has dominated my life  having to start a 5am kills  especially when i wake up with back pain from my previous shifts  on top of that i've had to deal with rude customers getting right up in my face getting angry at me for problems i can't solve  as well as management constantly telling me i need to pick up the pace when my back and legs are killing me  management expects us to pick 220 items an hour minimum which is ridiculous especially when it gets later in the day and there are customers blocking every aisle    today something just snapped  i can't say exactly how it happened but i ended up telling my manager i quit  at this point i don't care if i don't get paid for not giving my weeks notice they can keep the money it's a small price to pay to leave  i've decided to go back to education and try to get a university degree  i'm just happy to finally be free and hope that a degree will allow me to get a job that isn't so brutal and hopefully involves less manual labor ,m3lub6
566,How the hell did previous generations deal with this shit?,seriously   i don't fucking get it      it varies a bit according to your education history  some start work in high school  some in college  etc  but we have collectively agreed that working 40 hours a week with a two day break is the only thing possible in this life if you're the average person  and it seems like most are happy with this existence  considering that there is no broad movement for anti bullshit work sentiment outside this subreddit    i'm just saying i have no idea how i'm going to live with this shit for the rest of my life  and i'm struggling to comprehend how  there aren't more in the exact same boat  i'm realizing that any pleasures outside of work are just an aside  and work will be all you know until you retire  if you're lucky enough    with the way this country fetishzes hustle and work culture  i truly believe that we might see some of the gains lost by work activists in our lifetime  particularly those who brought us the 40 hour work week almost 100 years ago that should be obsolete by now   rant,m2bhma

591,Alternative societies,i see a lot of complaining on this sub  but what i m yet to see is someone with an alternative solution as to how we can live in society  with such a large population of humans   my first thought is people are going to need to work  thinking especially farmers or laborers for example  in order to keep us all fed and sheltered  people with these skills would need to work tirelessly  as they already do  how would we compensate them without money  and going back to capitalism   are there any authors or theorists out there who have suggested an alternative way of living in a society  and one which we can realistically transition into from the state we are in now    i d be very interested to learn about alternatives  as i believe the mental health crisis we are currently undergoing is caused by the somewhat purposeless lives most of us feel that we are living  by grinding away 8 hours a day 5 days a week  at least that  as i am not smart enough to think up any myself ,m2sbrt

593,Full time jobs take up too much time for anything else,i m young 19 and honestly i just think to myself there is literally zero chance i can and will do this my whole life  i just walk through my job and see people making the same wage as me and they are in their 50s 60s all of that  i imagine how they feel because they probably have back pain leg pains all that and they still haven t retired and yet some of them are there basically full time   now i have no problem with working full time i make good money and i pay for my car bill phone bill and a portion of the rent and my car ensurance  the problem isn t working the problem is how much work takes up your actual life  i work for one of those grocerie store companies but anyways it s just dumb how much working takes up your time like i ll be scheduled 5 or 6 days straight and 2 days off  but sometimes they ll finesse my schedule and work me 5 days farther to the end of the week and then they ll work me the first day of the new week so basically i would work 6 days straight instead of 5 and it s still just 40hrs per week  it s basically like 80  work and the other  20 is spent thinking how tf imma get out of this work life    people always say certain things are  unrealistic  like wanting to actually go for your goal or passion  example   pro athlete  actor  singer  rapper  influencer and more  honestly i d rather go for my real goals and passions which could take a year or maybe more to reach instead of slaving for these huge companies for the rest of my life  honestly i just want financial freedom and actual freedom  working for companies is more like they own you and you have to work around the schedule they make for you   like i have something on the side that i m working on to turn into my main income but a lot of the time i never have time to work on it because once i get home at around 9 40 i m already tired and ready to eat and chill for a bit then once i wanna work on it i m too tired and then i fall asleep and wake up in the morning like welp gotta get ready for work again  and then when the off days come you always are thinking in the back of my head damn i have to work tomorrow  regardless i m just gonna grind on my side goal and once i make income from it enough to equal my wage now then i ll quit working for another man for good  idk this is just a rant i m just wondering if anyone else feels the same way i feel bc work is too time consuming,m3kj3w

601,So what do we do?,i totally feel all the same emotions and feelings as everyone else in this subreddit  it's really nice to know there are people out there who feel like i do about things  but like  if we aren't going to fit into the norm  what is our solution   i still don't want to be supported by my parents  and of course i don't want to be a slave to a full time job  so what are some alternatives  how can i live on my own without giving my life to some random job  is there anyone here who is getting by doing things differently  and if so  how are you doing that   i'm just confused about what can i do  i feel so lost  it's like i give in to this fucked up system or i leap into the unknown and have advanced faith and discipline so that the stuff i want to do will provide for me  is there a way to avoid some intense strain on the senses  or is it important to have stress in a life  i'm rambling but i want to know if anyone has found solutions to the problems everyone in this subreddit is facing  thanks ,m3pidh

605,If they made primary school more the workplace...,some parts of primary school absolutely condition kids for a life of capitalism  homework  unnatural waking hours  threat of being homeless in your future life if you don't do well  but what if we went even further with this  what would primary school look like    if we really want to condition kids to what life is like  first we need to start getting them up at 6am  their school is over one hour away  with traffic  and even though school doesn't start till 8  their teachers expect them their at 7 45  they are made to feel bad if they show up at 8    the classrooms are grey and beige primarily    every single day teachers have kids teach themselves out of a book in the same subjects year after year  if they have a question  the teacher acts like they are bothering them and makes the kids feel dumb  passive aggressiveness is the main control mechanism  it is nailed into the kids heads that if they don't do well in school  they will be homeless as a direct consequence    there is no art  there is no gym  there is no music or extra curricular activities  just books  reading  studying  and doing exercises from the book all day  recess  they need to use their time more productively  electives  too much freedom    kids don't speak to many people at lunch  in fact  the lunchroom is made specifically too small to accommodate everyone for building cost effectiveness  most kids eat at their desk in silence    school hours are from 8am to 5pm with every other weekend  kids are conditioned to feel guilty for leaving at 5pm on the dot and there is no more cheering when the final bell rings  they almost have to appear disappointed that it's all over with  sometimes they're called in randomly at 7am on their saturday off  there is no summer break  or any other breaks for that matter  the kids are given 1 week of holiday a year or 2 weeks if they've been in the school district more than three years       i am pretty sure most people would consider this kind of life soul sucking to children  they would go so far as go call it abusive and cruel  but it's literally what we go through every day on top of the other adult things like maintaining our living areas  paying bills  cooking  and other things we have to do day in and day out that eat up the rest of our adult lives ,m3952n

637,My mother is a serf,my mother has had a long 40 year career doing an incredibly degrading job for rich people   she s an accountant for one of the richest families in michigan   they have so much wealth to keep track of  that they employ an office of twelve people to manage it all year long   most of what her job entails is moving hundreds of millions of dollars in money and investments around to try and help these fat cats dodge taxes   she also has the fun job of telling their trust fund kids that they exceeded their  60 000 spending limit for the month   she has an alright income rate from all of this  and solid job security  but the extra things they make her do are abhorrent for people who have so much   every tax season  she and her coworkers have to work all weekend  every weekend for two months on their own time  no overtime  all to try and do some extra manipulation and heavy lifting to make sure these richies pay as little in taxes as possible   i can imagine some pretty awful jobs  but this one is riddled with so much disgusting irony  her entire career revolves around making sure the people who have the most  contribute the least to society ,m38411

639,I love working. I just don’t love working to stay alive.,my guess is a lot of you  most  feel this way  too  i d love to build something that enhances society or makes people happy  but if i m so concerned with making enough money to keep the lights on  i may never do it   how did we get to a place in society where our ability to live became so closely tied to how much we could do for others   i hope that one day we can rely on machines to do enough work that we can create a utopia where people can choose whether to work and choose what to work on and when because all of our basic needs are met without anyone  having  to work   or just get rid of capitalism and let people do what they want  maybe then we can advance as a society instead of  advancing  aka coming up with more bs to peddle that forces people to work longer hours so they can afford it ,m33i3g

641,What are your plans?,i know most of us want to stop working  or possibly change jobs or the nature of work  but what realistic and achievable plans do you have in place to make that happen  and i'm talking about a realistic and viable plan and concrete steps toward that end  so if your plan is  i want to overthrow the entire system  that's admirable  but in order for this to be a meaningful discussion  i'd like to hear about the concrete actions you are taking or planning to take and how those will bring it about and what would you do with your life when that plan has come into fruition   i'd like to know because maybe we can share our ideas  discuss those ideas  help other realize their goals and maybe just support each other   i realize that people here come from different places in their lives and what may seem like a viable path for someone may not be even within the realm of possibilities for another  but maybe we can actually help each other  so even if you are struggling with minimum wage and just being able to put food on the table or pay rent  maybe we can come up with a plan so that the future isn't quite so bleak    my situation is  in short  this  i grew up poor  i went to school and landed what people consider a cushy corporate job  i worked hard for it and the payoff is actually pretty lousy and soul-sucking  not to mention the damage it has done to me mentally and physically    i've calculated that i need to save up  take risk in stocks  to the tune of about about  500k so that i can retire and live in a hut in the middle of nowhere and generate just enough in dividends to buy electricity and food    while i understand that that is capitalism and it might perpetuate the problem we all have here  i don't see any other viable option for me  i'm not able to bring about the social  economic or political change in a short enough amount of time that i could achieve my goal in the time frame i want  i e  about the next ten years  however  if enough of us corporate tools get out before a  normal  retirement age  maybe that will also bring about some change   so i save as much as i can so that i can get about a pretax income from capital alone of about  25k  which leaves me with north of about  1500 per month after taxes    i want my children to go to university and study something they care about and not something they think will benefit them in a corporate setting  i don't want them in a corporate setting at all and i just want them to be able to do what they like and live free    my hut is not some majestic mansion  just a hut in the middle of the forest  electricity  but no indoor plumbing   i've asked people around me who say they want to be rich about how much money exactly do they want  most of the time i hear some unachievable round number like  10 million  and they're always shocked to hear that my goal is 5  of that    i want to be free  not filthy rich    so hopefully this is a somewhat ok discussion starter ,m3gsia
642,Goodbye to my employers,for the past 2 years i ve been running a company for my bosses without the acknowledgement or the right remuneration purely because i cared for my job   over the past year they ve spent the time abroad in their house in mexico avoiding the lockdowns we ve had in the uk  despite that i continued my work because hey   we re all in this together   earlier this week i called them to ask for the correct title and remuneration for the job i ve been doing  they ve agreed over the call  but yesterday they ve retracted their decision and said no to my ask  so i resigned   don t let yourselves be manipulated and know your worth  it s so hard to realise that you are worth so much more than this  hindsight is a beautiful thing  at the end of the day this is purely a business transaction ,m32djq

645,Full time jobs take up too much time for anything else :(,i m young 19 and honestly i just think to myself there is literally zero chance i can and will do this my whole life  i just walk through my job and see people making the same wage as me and they are in their 50s 60s all of that  i imagine how they feel because they probably have back pain leg pains all that and they still haven t retired and yet some of them are there basically full time   now i have no problem with working full time i make good money and i pay for my car bill phone bill and a portion of the rent and my car ensurance  the problem isn t working the problem is how much work takes up your actual life  i work for one of those grocerie store companies but anyways it s just dumb how much working takes up your time like i ll be scheduled 5 or 6 days straight and 2 days off  but sometimes they ll finesse my schedule and work me 5 days farther to the end of the week and then they ll work me the first day of the new week so basically i would work 6 days straight instead of 5 and it s still just 40hrs per week  it s basically like 80  work and the other  20 is spent thinking how tf imma get out of this work life    people always say certain things are  unrealistic  like wanting to actually go for your goal or passion  example   pro athlete  actor  singer  rapper  influencer and more  honestly i d rather go for my real goals and passions which could take a year or maybe more to reach instead of slaving for these huge companies for the rest of my life  honestly i just want financial freedom and actual freedom  working for companies is more like they own you and you have to work around the schedule they make for you   like i have something on the side that i m working on to turn into my main income but a lot of the time i never have time to work on it because once i get home at around 9 40 i m already tired and ready to eat and chill for a bit then once i wanna work on it i m too tired and then i fall asleep and wake up in the morning like welp gotta get ready for work again  and then when the off days come you always are thinking in the back of my head damn i have to work tomorrow  regardless i m just gonna grind on my side goal and once i make income from it enough to equal my wage now then i ll quit working for another man for good  idk this is just a rant i m just wondering if anyone else feels the same way i feel bc work is too time consuming,m3kraw

647,Those coworkers who are oblivious to how bad their situation is. What's the deal with these people?,it's just like the gervais principle in the office  i really believe the top and the bottom are most similar  where middle management are a bit of a thing of their own   i don't have a bad attitude at all  i am lucky to have a decent middle class job that's usually 40 hours a a week    there's one person at my work  they are essentially a middle management level person  a real  company man woman   to be totally blunt  their personal life is a bit of a mess  they are older and divorced  with no kids  this is by far the best job they had in their life - they were a fast food manager before  again  nothing wrong with an attitude of gratitude  it's somebody who legitimately would rather be working    but this person is so fucking irritating to work with      is way too enthusiastic  doesn't understand boundaries  if there's an email thread going  she'll absolutely reply after hours  it sets a horrible standard     doesn't realize how badly they are getting screwed  they are the point person if there's an emergency  if there's a safety issue at 5am on a saturday  they are the person that's called  the craziest thing is they see this as a point of pride and importance  not as a burden   works way harder than literally anyone  but they aren't close to being the highest paid person  i don't even think they're in it for a living  so to speak  this job is basically their whole identity     has a shocking lack of perspective  again  this job is really one of the only things they've done with their life  but i think they are the type to not respect other people who may not want to work as hard   this people's life is just sad  to me   i think they don't realize how shitty work it  because they haven't been able to enjoy the legitimately great things in life    spending time with friends and family you love   shit like travelling and surfing and smoking good weed     everything else in my personal life that's better than fucking work,m2csgw

649,"""There is no money. There is no hope.""",i work as a contract employee for a credit card company  i won't say which one  but it's a big one   my department is image processing  when you need to send any kind of paperwork or digital image to a credit card company for whatever reason  be it a response to a bill  a credit dispute  or a photo of your driver's license as proof of your identity  we're the people who see it and enter the relevant information into the company's database   we are not customer-facing so no  we're not the ones you deal with when you call   we are also in no way responsible for any of the decisions that are made regarding your accounts or debts   one of the categories of mail i see every day are letters from cardmembers who say they are unable to pay their bill for whatever reason   it's not my job to read or respond  i just flatten out each letter and batch it for scanning so that higher-ups can call up a digital image of your letter in future dealings   but sometimes i just can't help catch a few phrases and sentences here and there   the other day i saw a handwritten note on a cardmember's bill  stating that the cardmember was 85 years old  in hospice care from an illness  on meager fixed income  and thus no longer able to pay what they owed us   the note was actually written by this person's daughter who was now responsible for taking care of them   at the end of the note  she simply wrote    there is no money   there is no hope   in that moment  i had a breakdown   for the next 20 minutes i couldn't function   here i am  working for a company that's demanding money from people who can't pay  people who are old and frail  unable to care for themselves anymore  families who can't afford to take care of their elderly parents  all because companies like the one i work for trapped them into contracts that guarantee this sort of outcome   i also came to the realization that  more likely than not  that's going to be me in the future  with no money  and no hope   yesterday we watched a video from the company's ceo in which he boasted about how we've increased our profits and broke records and had our best year ever   and all i could do was imagine that poor old woman laying on her death bed  surrounded by her children and grandchildren who were going broke because of us ,m3e4wf

675,My boss lied to me and thinks I can't read,another rant i couldn't help but post here  recently i requested that i be able to skip take my lunch break at work  i asked for this for a few reasons  the first reason is that my lunch break is constantly interrupted  i'm a warehouse worker and i am responsible for receiving and loading large shipments off of trucks  the issue is that these trucks always show up around my allotted lunch time  nobody else is able to work the forklift so i am literally the only person who can take care of this  so  at least twice a week if not more during busy season i have to stop my lunch and process these shipments  the second reason is that my commute is a solid 45 minutes each way  and i work an 8 5 hr day  this means that if traffic is average or bad i'm spending an average of 10 hrs a day away from home  if i don't take my lunch and just took 5-15 minutes to eat  i could be home a solid half hour earlier to the woman i love  ultimately i realize this is a personal request and not everyone has the luck to even ask this of their employer  but i dared to ask anyways  i would've taken a straight no for an answer without issue  i take issue when my boss not only side stepped my request  but lied to me as if i wouldn't be able to fact check them  i sent them a direct email  they didn't respond to me so  i asked a coworker who had more direct contact to tell them to check their email and respond to me  my boss had the audacity to not even respond to me through my email or by phone  but instead  responded to a separate coworker who gave me their response  it essentially amounted to no you can't do that i want you here until the last minute to make sure the place is in order every day  we'll whatever right  nope they kept going stating that law required me to take lunch and it was out of their hands  except  i had looked up both state and federal law before asking to make sure that it would be a problem for this exact reason  i looked at evey possible credible source and found no such requirement on either a state or federal level  no other person at my workplace lives more than 10 minutes away  having worked for this company for 5 years  i figure maybe the boss would give me this little leeway so that i could not only have the annoyance of interrupted work-through lunches removed  but also get home to my dear a little earlier in the evening  but no  i'll go fuck myself because my boss thinks i can't read between the lines and take no like an adult  fuck them and fuck the people who spew shit hrough their teeth like they do i'm so fucking sick of being treated like a middle schooler at work  tl dr  my boss lied about there being a law preventing me from skipping my non-existant lunches to leave a little earlier to go home to my love ,lzs6w4

678,UBI and Assured Housing will just lead to serfdom if we aren't careful,i know a lot of people on this sub really like the idea of ubi and assured housing to remove the violence of capitalist society   however  when thinking of this  it's even more important to use logic to get through this situation    why would your torturer put down the lash if not to pick up a worse tool to hurt you with   serfdom was actually a pretty good deal for it's time   'free' land to till  your lord's armies and walls would protect your family from bandits  and your lord would even throw you parties out of appreciation  yup  pizza parties are that old   did i mention they worked an average of 3 days a week   thing is  this was back when the elites of society were basically dying from the same things we were and not even living that much more comfortably than peasants  plus there wasn't that much of a technological gap between swords and ploughshares   this is the best case scenario for ubi assured housing and it doesn't have a chance of happening   modern elites are used to being able to extract 20x-1000x the profit for something they pay for  you can bet your ass they'll be doing that if they're 'giving you' a stipend and a place to stay   3 days   how about 7  you now live at your job   we don't even have to imagine this  there was a very good post on here that was unfortunately deleted where the person detailed being offered  free housing  by an employer  who then verbally abused them  forced them to build countless projects on their property  and even asked their work to scale back their hours to do more unpaid tasks for them at home    yang and musk are sus   when an elite is talking about ubi or assured housing it should send a chill down your spine   they do not have the same needs as you or i   even the most well intentioned politicians are brought up to the status of elite once they win their election   they will never worry about being hungry  their resume will assure them some form of advisory role in some company for more than you will make in your lifetime just because of their role in society   when they hamstring their campaign promises  when they sabotage their constituency  when the only elites who can say anything that would actually fix our issues are too weak to do anything  that isn't them being stupid or incompetent   it is part of the plan   please don't be dense  there really is no such thing as a free lunch under capitalist society      we will need some form of assured resources  housing  etc  to remove the violence from capitalism  but it must be taken from the ruling class  that power must be physically removed from the hands of the ruling class and placed in our control or we will never be sure what we are giving up in the short or long term ,ly8n1v
679,Anyone ever just wonder what the point of life is under the current economic/work system?,without getting too bleak or anything  does anyone wonder what the point of this whole existence is if you're literally working for the most part of your life   get up at 7  work starts at 9  if you're lucky  ends at 5  if you're lucky  then you're home at around 6 or so  again  if you're lucky  repeat daily until you're an old man woman  is this it  then  the wage slavery  literally just surviving and not living or doing anything meaningful for a decent amount of time that it actually matters  anyway   2 weeks off in entire year if you're in north america  which is an absolute joke  i know it's different in europe and some middle eastern countries like uae where you get 4  but still  wtf does one even do with 2 weeks a year  you can't explore the world  can barely explore the country you're in   another absolutely annoying thing is the sunday night anxiety  which is what i'm basically feeling right now and why i'm writing this post i guess  what tomorrow holds  do this  do that  will they ask me to do this  damn  how am i supposed to do this again  oh  i really hope i don't have to work beyond 6 again   so  again what is the point of this  if i'm being brutally honest unless you've gotten your financial freedom  which is ridiculously hard unless you have some super unique talent or something  and certainly isn't as simple as these  bro just invest  guys on youtube make it out to be  wtf is this all about  i honestly rather live in a 2nd world country  work part time and just become a minimalist  lower cost of living  work 20 hours a week or so and have somewhat of my freedom  instead of this bs  where your entire life revolves around work   i don't care how normalized it is and if this is what being an adult is  then count me the fuck out  man  i choose not to grow up and partake ,m03qc6

731,Rant: my company has an annual bonus program to “incentivize you”,so  like others have said here  we have an annual bonus program that is actually not half bad  but  there is a catch  they add up your hours of  availability  then run it through an equation  so  for example  let s say you got sick a few times  took three whole days of funeral leave  had to take another week off for surgery  got covid  and followed health department guidelines to keep your actual coworkers safe and healthy  and your year end quote  availability  was only 85  even though you accepted plenty of ot shifts throughout the year  then  because of their little number crunch equating  you lose 60  of your bonus    how does that  incentivize  a person at all  it 100  incentivizes you to come in to work sick  break pandemic protocol  miss your grandfathers funeral  and come back to work high on pain pills from having delivered a baby last week  are these people for real    this is my first year ever i will have ever gotten a year end bonus  last year i got one for 2019  but i was hired in june  so i only got half a years worth  which was still pretty nice      2020 happened  i worked all year through the pandemic  a lot of employees got to work from home  but my job is essential  we are happy to get a bonus this year because the business was down quite a bit  but  no matter  this year i had a funeral  missed three shifts due to quarantine rules  had surgery  and called out twice  due to a whole 2 5 weeks out  i ll be losing like 20  of the bonus i think  i don t see the incentive though    this year i m pregnant  and will be taking 12 weeks off  and i m happy about that  whatever  but  i ll be out for so long i probably will get zero dollars for 2021 bonus  i definitely could take 6-8 weeks off  but  the bonus would still be so small i don t see the point  there is no actual incentive     the only  incentive  i can see in the entire company  is some higher up  vp  who gets like a 20  bonus  since i m hourly  and a lowly worker i get like 7  who has a kid  he will totally show up for work the next day after baby is born  in order to keep his bonus  and  honestly  he just pushes paper all day  doesn t really make product  so  it s backwards as usual ,m1o4bz

742,Comparing American work vocabulary to British work vocabulary reveals stark differences in work culture,in the uk  when you want to take time off work and travel  you go on holiday  so happy and fun  the word is focused on what you do instead of work  it makes sense that they d use such a happy word  the british have guaranteed time off every year and their passport used to grant them free access to all of europe   in america  a  holiday  is only used to mean time off on christmas  martin luther king day  new years etc  regular workers don t even get time off in those  holidays  in the us  some office workers get some of them off  but it s all up to the boss    when we take time off not on a holiday  we use a super negative word for it   we don t go on holiday  we leave our post vacant  we leave our beloved boss with a vacancy  we take a vacation   the word itself is not fun at all  the word itself is trying to shame you for taking time off ,m1ier6

747,I fully support antiwork but my parents keep freaking out.,i am a 22 year old guy who has graduated from a top college in india  i had a job that paid me way above an average salary but i quit it after a few months because i just didn't want to work at all  there was also a personal incident at home  i have been living at my parent's home since lockdown and i was working from home   after i quit my job  my parents completely supported my decision because they trust me  i wanted to take a long break after leaving the job so that i didn't have to work  i wanted to work on algotrading so that i could do something that can make money and required less manual labor  i told my parents that i will be working on this project for some time and i will start looking for a job after i am done with this project    but the thing is  i started taking it easy and took a lot of times 3 months  and the project still isn't finished  now after a month or two  my parents started freaking out  thinking that if this keeps going on  it will make a huge gap on my resume and i will not be able to get a job  this happens every week now  my parents just start freaking out and start pushing me to find a job or else i will never be able to find one  i get that their concerns are valid in their positions and they are just thinking about my job safety and better future out of love but i don't really think that it is a good idea to just rush into job-slavery which my parents want me to do  if i had a choice  i would live my life without doing any job  but i guess i have to get a job or else my parents will keep stressing themselves out and as a result  will keep stressing me out   do you guys face similar issues  should i abandon my project and just start looking for a job    sorry for my grammar  english isn't my first language ,m235tn
748,Antisocial culture will kill us all,i'm not even exaggerating   i understand that not everyone wants to go to parties  dance around in clubs  and go to family gatherings  but hear me out   humans as animals fucking suck   we spent literally millions of years getting hunted by better animals   we only really have two beneficial weapons in a stone age world   we are really good at collecting stuff  and we are able to work together   forget the big brain shit because it literally doesn't even matter until we can get those two skills down   the only reason we are where we are at is because we learned to cooperate  because we were friendly enough to have other humans to watch our ass and do the things we weren't as good at   i'm a big lefty but currency had a big hand in this   see  humans don't have the brain power to actually have that many social connections  it caps off between 100-150 maximum  which is a pretty small community   you can't actually do very much with only a couple hundred people  you can't have sophisticated sewage systems  and you can't have scientific research   this changed with technological advancements  starting with bartering systems  currencies like gold  and eventually fiat currencies like dollars   what this represents isn't the development of capitalism  but a necessary development of systems that would allow for collaboration across many different 100-150 sized social groups     now in the modern era we have been so propagandized by a bourgeois society that we have almost entirely replaced socialization with the technology of currency exchange and it is killing us   this is because doing that only works if you are already at the top of the system   a rich person is fundamentally different from you and i   they have so much money that they don't go shopping  they pay someone to do it for them   they don't manage their own money  they pay someone to do it for them   of you are rich you can completely replace your social system with a system of paying people  and you can do this until you die   the rest of us  literally cannot do this   if you do not maintain social connections you will be taken advantage of and robbed   you probably will not ever have enough money to sustain a lifestyle of replacing all of your social connections with monetary ones   this is why the system is so sinister  you will see your capitalist live like this  replacing the effort needed in creating social relationships with the almighty dollar  they will say that one day you can be like them   you may go all in  replacing time spent socializing which would give you a sincere  stable support structure for an opportunity to replace it with money   they will take and take and take your time while you chase that dream  until you eventually fall short  are too old to build that support structure  with your body too frail to take care of yourself  and you will die  having done nothing with your life except make your boss rich   capitalism is an antisocial social order  and it will run us into the ground    i don't need to worry about the planet if i have enough money for a bunker  is a meme that will kill us all ,m1yjot

752,I really wish people would stop glamorizing entrepreneurship like it’s not still work...,rant    i get it  working for yourself  setting your own schedule  unlimited income is all amazing perks of being an entrepreneur but it s still work  i had a business in the past and in the beginning stages i wore every single hat from accounting to social media management and it can be exhausting to force yourself to close your laptop for the day and not answer emails because sometimes you feel like you just haven t done enough or there isn t enough time in the day to get all of your work done  even when you re no longer in the start up phase  you re still devoting so much of your time to working  which for some people may be fine if you re  doing what you love  but even people who work their dream jobs aren t walking on rainbows everyday they go into work    as an entrepreneur sometimes the pressure is on 10x s as much because you re the one that has to pull yourself out of bed so you can pay your bills  feed your family and live a comfortable life  so many influencers and entrepreneurs nowadays glamorize entrepreneurship like being able to sleep in until 12 or they re always in hawai i like sure there s perks but there are a lot more entrepreneurs that are sacrificing time with family to make sure their business runs smoothly so they can keep up their self-employed lifestyle so they don t have to go back to working a 9-5   sorry i really just had to get that off of my chest  i m just so annoyed of hearing people say  oh you re sick of working a 9-5  start a business   don t like your retail job  monetize your hobby  the answer to our capitalist system is not always entrepreneurship  and to be honest it s not for everyone  it s hard work  instead of resorting to forcing entrepreneurship down people s throats support causes and ideas that promote a society where everyone can live comfortably without having to hustle outside of their day job ,m06oxd

755,Just my thoughts,if you just take a moment to observe reality around you  you see birds chirping on trees  flying around from sunrise to sunset  you see fishes swimming and butterflies flying on those beautiful flowers     every animal starts its day when the sun is up and ends when it is dark  they eat  fly  run  chill  think  play and live in harmony with nature     the man starts his day when the sun isn t up yet  throws himself in a shower and drives a small lethal machine to get to a place where he is stuck and only quits after the sunset     the man s life is perfectly designed to never enjoy the sunlight  the wind  the trees and live in harmony with nature     staring at a screen for 8  hours a day is what many people consider a goal but in reality is just a synthetic reality where you barely live     you stay up late in the night and completely change your own biorhythm just to have that small bit of free time to enjoy something outside work and the next day here we go again     i m so tired of pretending my life is just this  just a screen and worrying that the company isn t making any sales as if i d have any benefit from that     i envy people that have free time  not the rich one  i couldn t care less to own a bmw or a huge house  i just want free time and the basic needs to be fulfilled  is that much to ask     is it worth it  an entire life staring at a screen just to afford a living     is it so much to ask for a hot meal everyday and a shelter     no one should fucking starve and dedicate their own life just to afford a soup of noodles     what are the alternatives  they took everything away from us  owning a land is now a privilege that few can afford  the entire system works by keeping you inside those 9-5 endlessly and making sure you won t make any spiritual jump in your life because if that happens you may start doing crazy things like taking time for yourself instead of grinding for that yacht the boss wants     they own every right on you      you have to ask to take time for yourself   you have to be there if your manager calls you    you are being threaten to lose your job if you don t exceed the expectations    you must be happy to work    you must have a smile on your face because we don t want sad faces here    what  you quit at 5 o clock  i see you don t care enough     everyone is over-doing just because it s a fucking challenge how much i can resist before breaking  what is this  is this life  this is legalised slavery     and while you slave-wage there s that influencer that is making 100x of what you do just by posting an ad on their instagram page     can you imagine that     working hard never pays off  never     it s a scam that many of us fell into  that is not according to nature laws tho  that s why life is synthetic     if you work endlessly on your land you ll have more food to sustain yourself  of course there may be adverse conditions but this is exactly what life is     life is not stillness  life is not an instagram post  life is not wage-slaving for a piece of bread     we tricked us into thinking that if we don t have something stable we won t make it  we fear the changes that may destroy our crop and make us starve  but we forget we are giving up our freedom for security and safety     is it better to be free and risk it or  be numb your entire life just to afford being alive ,m0k4mw

762,Working isn't bad on its own. Exploitation is.,i'd like to get a conversation started on this matter      while i agree with the sentiment that work can be a drag and a hinderance working is still prefered to the alternative      if we look at this from an economics perspective here is what we have     gdp is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy over a given period of time    if people work less then assuming everything else the same  there are less goods or services being offered in an economy  which means the private consumption of them diminishes       which in turn makes businesses lay off staff since they no longer need as many people working there       that in turn pushes for a weaker demand in the economy  less sales mean a negative forecast and less need for workers which increases unemployment      all of this is capitalisms fault you might say  well capitalism is vastly preferred to the alternative  there are academic studies that have followed the evolution of gdp per capita  in power purchasing parities  during centuries and concluded no other economy has had such a sustained and expressive growth as capitalists economies have       which means when capitalism works everyone gets richer and they get richer compared to economies that haven't implemented capitalism  and that is proven its not my opinion       furthermore when you start increasing the demands for businesses to operate in they will hire less people  the harder it is to fire the less people will be hired since businesses can antecipate the legal hardships  which in turn increases unemployment  and if working was bad not receiving any income is worse     it seems that most people on this sub don't hate work as much as they hate working in a toxic environment  or working in a place that doesn't fulfill them in a significant matter     you don't hate working  you hate your job        does the system need to change  yes  is it by abolishing capitalism  no ,m1lhvk

Feel like a loser now if I were to drop out and do a trade or something.,if i say how much i feel about not liking college in another typical kind of sub about college  i d probably just get told to  suck it up  or   you don t have it as hard as i did    they tell you that you have to do shit you don t like because that shows employers that you are a capable person - doing mentally taxing work and spending an unfavorable amount of time doing it  or that it  prepares you  yeah  preparing me for more miserableness in the future    they tell you that you should get these higher paying jobs  like stem  so you can live more comfortably  sure  more money is good  but is the effort even worth it in the first place though    i ve been spinning my wheels in college for almost 4 years  and i m like not even half way to be able to get an associates yet  my fault completely  the further time i have left and added on difficulty of progressively more difficult courses to take gives me dread    i feel like a loser compared to other people in their 20s  i still live with my parents  going to school and might end up going until i get a bachelor s  which would be when i m like fucking 27 years old  that s like 22 years straight of going to school  this is hellish  i feel like a loser for wanting to drop out and just do a trade that doesn t stress me out mentally  i can take physical stress much easier  there s already tons of people in their early 20s living independently and some people right around my age already about to graduate  i m like the kid who got held back a billion years   i don t know if i can handle the stress of creating programs as my career  it s so daunting now already  my mind is forced to constantly have to create original things which makes this feel even more harder than doing math ,m06g37

782,The myth of being a high performer at work,it is said that in order to get a raise  an employee must do more than what they are paid  although this sounds like it makes sense  i think that s not how it works in most workplaces  for one thing  i ve yet to work at a job where just the amount of work and effort one needs to complete it is just right-there s either an overwhelming amount of work  making completing it an impossible achievement in and of itself  let alone excelling in it  or jobs that require minimal effort to complete  and people just sit around 80  of the day- which in most cases  are those sinking ship companies where they aren t gonna invest in raises and growth anyway  in the first case  excelling at the job is impossible  where in the second case  pointless    i think performance has more to do with playing the power game right  rather than actual performance  the notion of  doing more than what you are paid for  benefits those on the top  but not necessarily the worker  especially when excelling at a job is a requirement rather than something actual high performers are rewarded extra for   in reality  most who give it 100  every day are simply  doing their job  while those who have realistic expectations for work are considered to be slackers    ideally  a job should only require 60-70  of effort to complete  with the remaining 30-40  reserved for employees to think  rest  reflect  plan  cover for a colleague on leave  or to willingly work harder if they want to go after a promotion  you simply can t exceed expectations when you re expected to give it 100  every single day ,lxaiqz

796,Ethics of passive income, comment thread because i disagree with the upvote downvote distribution  but the post is archived  so hecc  i guess i'll make a new post  'd  it doesn't really make sense to me why writing a book and getting royalties would be any more ethical than investing money in the stock market and getting dividends  in the case of publishing a book  you put in the work up front to write a book which enables workers who assemble and distribute books something to sell  you sit back and collect a portion of the earnings while they do the ongoing work  in the case of investing in the stock market  you put in the work up front to earn the money you invest  which is used to build the means of production that enables workers to produce  you sit back and collect a portion of the earnings while they do the ongoing work   i guess you might argue that most of the stock market is owned by people who didn't work to earn the money they used to invest  but inherited it from rich parents or collected it by doing nothing at an overpaid bullshit job or something  but i'd argue that's more analogous to your parents writing a book and letting you publish it under your name  either way  same situation as above  only you didn't put in the work upfront  so i still don't see how owning intellectual property would be different from owning stocks from an ethical standpoint  there are all sorts of ways to acquire both   the way i see it  writing a book isn't comparable to  doing a normal job only you get the money later instead of right away  because there's no upper bound on how much you can earn from royalties  it's getting a theoretically infinite amount of money from a finite amount of work  just like investing in stocks  it's possible because someone else is doing the ongoing work of assembling and selling the books  but idk  what do you guys think   on another note  i'm not sure if i'd say fi re is  ethical  but i don't really think it's  unfair  as in  i don't think people doing fi re are getting more than their fair share of value for putting in less than their fair share of work  basically  people doing fi re work full time for 10-20 years until they save enough to live on for the rest of their lives  40 hours of work per week for 10 years is the same amount of work as 10 hours of work per week for 40 years  and don't we basically believe that everyone should have enough to live on while only needing to work 10 hours per week  so i really can't bring myself to grudge fi re people who only accumulate what they need to support themselves and their families    i mean okay  there's no real ethical way of existing in this capitalistic system and we should abolish it etc etc  but that's going to take time  i'm not saying individualistic approaches are a solution  but in the meantime  is there any way to make things more tolerable for ourselves without being a  complete  asshat ,lxzt87

something  almost  imperceptible but something significant that i couldn't pin down until recently slapped in the face with the obviousness of it - this low and almost imperceptible  sound  sensation  that buzzed  hummed  rumbled  whistled and whined all at once with a subtle smell of damp and rot  when i noticed it there was no un-noticing it and it was there  not just in the but the background but the background itself  emanating it seemed from all directions  at first i assumed  or hoped  it was a mechanical abnormality  maybe the furnace laboring especially hard because of the cold weather  but i found it followed me home  subdued slightly  until brought back and felt at its 'full' volume on my return to work  it was as if the building and my body were speaking a language i could suffer but not understand   it was all-consuming  i assumed  or hoped  i would eventually tune it out or be able to focus my attention in spite of it  but it was both subtle enough to not completely overwhelm and constant enough to be irritating and unignorable  with each passing day  week  and month i could feel my memory and energy eroding  along with my very will to exist at all  there was no longer a single aspect of my job to trick myself into enjoying anymore and i would dread the cycle continuing from the moment it finished  i attributed my newfound anxiety and the strange symptom it had manifested to a general fatigue of covid and the accelerated absurdity that was 2020  and let s be real  the few years preceding too  but i couldn't shake the feeling that something was  seriously  off  something beyond normal - it was like my spirit was being sucked  suffocated  and smothered by some force unseen - force that preferred me exhausted to dead   i figured my stress was also made worse by a timely mid-life crisis  i just turned 30  where i was struggling to let go of whatever bright-eyed childhood dreams i once lived with and had now forgotten  and diminished to a drone in pursuit of a goal i couldn't quite wrap my head around - a goal that made no real sense to me  or  i suppose  the goal made sense but my means of getting there didn't  i was stuck wanting to be unstuck and the only way to get unstuck i was told was to unstick myself   my manager must have noticed how disconnected i d been because he called me in to his office and asked in a hushed tone and with great concern  if  everything was okay   i told him about the general stress  fatigue  and anxiety i'd been feeling lately and also made up some lie about learning of an old  and imaginary  friend s passing  all while the 'buzz' hummed tirelessly  as it always did  behind our conversation  although i had mostly acclimated to life with the sound and stench of this sensation  for the first time since i had felt it for the first time it overwhelmed me and consumed everything else in that room and i could only sit there  alone  injured and not sure how or who to ask for help because i couldn't even quite articulate what i felt was happening to me    seriously  thegreatself  are you alright  you look like you re about to pass out   his words broke through  each word and then each syllable punctuated by static   i grimaced and pinched the bridge of my nose  i asked him if he heard a buzzing    like tinnitus    sort of  i guess  not really  or maybe  i don t know  i have to make an appointment with my doctor   he smiled  wide and wildly  eyes unmoving - his face set with an expression that felt far too exaggerated for the kind of interactions we usually had    have you ever met our boss   i struggled to answer because the question was a little stupid and one he already knew the answer to  anticipating my confusion and i'm sure reading it on my face  my hesitation was his turn to continue    i mean the  real  boss - the one above all else   the way he said those last five words creeped me the fuck out  and a deep instinctual gut reaction to just run reared its head then and there  his change in tone was so stark that it sounded like some disembodied voice had pushed its way out through a portal and past his lips   i briefly wondered who the fuck could be above the sole owner and founder of our company and the biggest asshole in the building  but before i could answer his eyes finally shifted to match his smile  igniting like someone just given permission to share something intimate - something they desperately want to talk about but can't or don't often get the opportunity    follow me  there's something i think you should see   i sat up from my chair before he even finished and  as if propelled by something i wanted no part of  followed behind him  past a row of cubicles and down a stairwell towards the ground floor  and eventually past it into the bowels of the building  whatever it was that pushed me forward was only helped by my very-human capacity for curiosity  and whether or not i wanted to be a part of whatever was going on  i was   so i moved forward  the only way i could go   the further we descended the more intense the sensation seemed to surround  but it morphed into something else  twisting and contorting itself with the added sounds of grinding metal  shattering glass  explosions  gunfire  and tormented human screaming layered into a single consuming cacophony that was one endless crescendo   i don't know exactly how many flights of stairs we climbed down but it had to be more than actually existed  by the time we reached the bottom i could barely walk or hold myself up unassisted and my faithful guide had to steady me to make any progress  my heart was pounding faster than that one time i ate too many edibles and every beat sent bursts of pain right to the centre of my brain and it felt like my skull was about to explode  torn apart by a noise i could hear but not understand   i wanted to collapse but i was being propped up and practically dragged by this point    what the fuck is happening to me  i need to go to the hospital    there's  nothing  wrong with you and there's  nothing  the hospital can do for you  don t worry  we're not far now and then you ll see - and then you'll wish you didn't see   see what  whatever it was i didn't want to see it  i just wanted some relief from the hell in my head  but when he said the hospital couldn t help i instinctively and instantly knew he was right - i knew whatever was wrong with me was something significant and i was its opposite  i knew that if i went to the hospital i was going to end up in a psych ward but the longer we continued the more that seemed like maybe that's just what i needed   we trudged down a long corridor lit by those awful fluorescent lights that smother everything in a flat constrastless and cold white  a single heavy metal door with a porthole stood out at the end of the hallway  lined on each side by doors that looked far more appropriate in the context of an office building  every few seconds a banging on the door repeated in some strange disjointed pattern  like discordant music from another dimension   and then everything was quiet - i  heard  quiet for the first time in over a year  i stood limply at this door now overwhelmed and sick with exhaustion  stricken by a silence that seemed foreign and alien to me  if the  buzz  was all-consuming then the silence was its inverse - pure emptiness   i felt sick   i wanted to collapse   i was urged forward by a voice that trembled with a mixture of fear  anger  and anticipation    we're here  go ahead  it's all right in there  everything you need to know is in there  everything you re feeling is in there  you asked about the noise so now witness it  see it  feel it  let it show itself to you  let it consume you  open the door  open the door   i felt like i was being beckoned by something vast and ancient - as if i was being called into a void that might swallow me whole and in swallowing me  relieve me of everything that burdened me   if i had a choice i didn't know it  if i could have turned around and walked back upstairs i think i would have - but i didn't  because i couldn't - i could do only what i did and grip the door s handle tightly with both hands and heave   the sound of metal scraping started the symphony of sound again  a cold air blasted past me  carrying with it every awful and terrifying image and symbol my brain knew and could imagine  it was as if i had opened a door to a raging storm in a boundless ocean  where the wind whipped and carried with it things that were not  things  at all but more like memories  disfigured and distorted and twisted by time's passage   the sound and stench were back and more than ever  and in a single horrifying flash i knew that its source was not external - it wasn't in the building  behind the walls  or even the door to another dimension i now stood in front of - it was living inside me and it had festered and grown until what 'i' was once was consumed and all but forgotten  what i saw behind that door was only a reflection of the ugliest parts of our own particularly peculiar  human sickness  - greed  gluttony  ignorance and contempt   there was nothing to see but i saw it anyway - an infinite blackness silhouetted a vaguely human form  some strange amalgamation of familiar but mutated parts arranged nonsensically that danced in a frenzy  thrashing and jerking with eyes absent yet looking straight through me  as if it simultaneously didn't even acknowledge me and viewed whatever i was with a great radiating hatred   as it danced it counted and as it counted uncountable jewels sparkled and shimmered and rained down all around it and with each obscene and unrecognizable number it grew   more - more is all it wants  all it knows  and all it is  more  more and more  forever  more  insatiable  all-consuming  accumulating endlessly  forever - and ever - and beyond ever  because never is enough enough  there is no enough  more  always more  more is all there is  more is all that drives it - there is no end and no enough  just a tireless march towards more  a singular purpose of more more more more more more more more give me more more is not enough everything there is not enough there will never be enough   with a deafening crack i was back sitting in my manager's office  nose pinched between my thumb and finger and words echoing and rattling in my head    seriously  thegreatself  are you alright  you look like you re about to pass out   the sound and stench were still there  just subdued    what do you work for   he raised an eyebrow  considered  and confidently chuckled his reply    money   his laugh seemed to echo through the entire building and nestle itself to the now barely audible but still debilitating hum   maybe i never really left that office but maybe that didn't really matter - maybe what i saw was still 'real' regardless  maybe what might be true is just as significant as what is  or at least  what appears to be   i know it exists because i interact with it daily and i see hints that most others do  too - we just don't know how to frame or conceptualize it beyond talking about 'mental health' within the boundaries it permits   it wails endlessly and i'm sure differently for all  silently screaming its own sick song or whispering vague promises of fulfillment to those chosen to be wielded to its end - to continue and preserve it as  the one above all else  - it is ancient and it is evil  and  most terrifyingly  it is a part of  us  and a part seemingly inseparable  an inoperable tumor that has been with us for so long we cannot imagine life in its absence because as far as we know there is no such thing   it exists because it must   or so it has led us to believe - so it manipulates us into prostration and so it forces submission through its single-minded and sole purpose - more is never enough   it doesn t want you to know that  we  can talk and that conversation might be all it takes to destroy or at least cripple it  it has prepared for that by instilling in us a sense that this is just  the way the world is  as if  the way the world is  is completely untouched by our collective ideas about it   seeing the acceleration into absurdity that is the past decade  i m convinced it's possible to get a message out and that message might shrink it  not kill it outright but at least wound it  i m counting on it  in fact  because everything i read and everything i feel in my gut leads me to the inevitability of this world s total collapse  not by entropy but consumed by our own parasitic miasma of peddling and profit - a world where power  politics and profit are indistinguishable   a message so simple  it can t be  misinterpreted   a message so simple  it will be  misinterpreted    unify   that is our only hope of depriving it - of smothering it underneath our collective gravity and extinguishing it with our shared sense of what is right  what is good  what is just  what is valuable  what is true  and most importantly what is  possible  - the only thing it fears if it even knows what that is  is that  we  might wish it away  because as all-consuming and powerful as it is  it is just as fragile  perched on the precipice of uncertainty and fed  powered  and driven by nothing other than  us  and our own warped inclinations and desires - our perfectly  human  inclinations and desires   and with all that said there is nothing to do but return to wage-slavery and give myself over to the void  because really what else is there   nothing - just the counting ,lx1shq
807,I really hate Jack Welch and I think he stands for everything wrong with corporations,keep in mind there are probably a lot of other guys much worse than him  but this guy sticks out to me because how much they jerk him off when we now know he was an absolute fraud   jack welch was chairman and ceo of general electric  ge  between 1981 and 2001  he was called one the greatest ceos of all time  i mean the profit figures said so  the stock said so  so he has to be great right   they jerk him off so hard that even when i first heard about him  i was sorta skeptical  they would keep talking about his great mindset  his great vision  his great leadership etc  they even have stuff like the jack welch management institute  books on how to lead like him goddamn it makes me wanna puke  soon they're going to put his face on mount rushmore and create statues of him bigger than the jesus one in brazil   in reality he's the equivalent of one of those kings who's reign caused irreparable damage to the kingdom and would keep declining until it died  general electric despite surviving over 100 years as one of the biggest companies was booted from dow jones industrial average recently  and you can thank him for causing it   basically he stripped and sold all the electrical related divisions of general electric that he didn't consider profitable enough  yeah killing the things that made it last over 100 years  he cared so much about ge being a financial company he basically let ge capital run wildly without restrictions  not too mention all those failed financial service projects which is what he used the money for after selling divisions and laying off workers  oh yeah and don't forget about all those  accounting tricks  he used to make the profit numbers look real good lol   when it came to his culture  he was the guy who made the vitality curve aka forced ranking  so basically everyone regardless has to be ranked and every time there will be some guys forced to be at the bottom  those guys get fired  this system has been copied by many firms and even if not directly used  the mindset from it is still there  people become paranoid as the workplace becomes  survivor  all thanks to this wonderful guy   its funny when he talks about high performance because if he was under this system  he would have been fired long ago   in 1963  an explosion at the factory which was under his management blew off the roof of the facilities  but luckily back then workers had more rights and forgiveness until he came along to crush them  i never worked for the guy personally so i can't tell but i heard he was a massive prick in real life  like the kind of boss that would constantly turn red throw tantrums and expected no one to oppose him  even when he played a lot of golf with the president  like the ego this guy had could probably solve our energy crisis  he even tried to change the ge logo with his own design  but thats to be expected right  sociopath who aren't good at working but talking and backstabbing are the guys to rise to the top and he's just another prime example  office politics 101   i didn't do very in depth research so there's probably a lot more stuff about him  especially all those meaningless business buzzwords  the point is the media and corporates love to jerk him off when he was the complete opposite  he pretty much represents everything wrong with corporate culture  the damage he has done not just to ge but the rest of us because of many companies following his  values  is beyond measure ,lxmc6w

810,"""The Customer is Always Right"" is fascist brainwashing.",the nature of capitalism is primarily one of a dictatorship of capital  a dictatorship of capitalists as the primary owners of capital   in wielding capital you effectively wield dictatorial power  even as a working class person  for the small moment you exchange currency for something of value  the culture of capitalism offers you dictatorial power  the  customer is always right   why is that   it's because it is foundational to capitalism  capital has unlimited power under capitalism   without the practice of allowing even the lower classes dictatorial power relative to the exchange of their currency  a vanishingly small share of capital  there would not be the dictatorial power of bosses  landlords  and banks using their greater overall capital to wield even greater dictatorial power  over employees  over tenants  over politicians and smaller capitalists    the customer must always be right  because in essence  even the employee-employer relationship is a  merchant-customer  relationship   your boss is your customer  they wield dictatorial power with their capital and purchase your labor power  time out of your life  and own you for a period of time   even if you use the  freedom  to walk away from a bad job  you are still beholden to  the customer is always right  you will need to find a new customer  a new capitalist to survive  every time risking that this dictatorial power will be antagonistic to your livelihood   if you offer bad service or appear rebllious  this will spread like with any  business  and you will risk not finding new customers  a new capitalist   you are not owned by any one person like under a feudal system  you are owned by capital  and by extension  those who wield it   the customer is always right because under capitalism  capital is your god and it can do whatever it wants to you ,lwwabp

830,1 week for a whole year,i get it you can just take time off whenever you want but how does it make sense that after working an entire year that i only earned a week of vacation time   i don't understand the incentive behind it  it does not motivate me to work harder it simply makes me want to cut corners  this idea that i have to use sick time on top of vacation time to take a longer trip frustrates me and it really makes me wonder why i shouldn't just quit and just put everything into winning the lottery,lx22qk

834,I really hate being a middle manager,i hate being a manager  i feel like i've really pulled back the curtain and seen how bad the work machine is   i've worked for one of the largest insurance companies in uk  maybe largest in europe actually  for about 10 years  it was ok work  i was on the phones logging motor accident claims  eventually i got very lucky and through a series of promotions i'm now a team leader for an audit team    my team at the moment are beyond burnt out and there's nothing i can do about it  basically we've had a restructure and been given a new way to work  what this means is instead of 12 large projects a year its now 30ish smaller projects but with a quicker deadline  this new deadline is completely unreasonable  it's insane   my team are working well over their hours to get the work done and i hate it  i've gone to the execs and complained about it but i was told quite clearly my team obviously aren't working hard enough which i called bullshit on  my team are great and these new deadlines are a failure on management's part  i was told my job is ensure deadlines are met and that's it   i hate it so much and i'm not being allowed to actually manage my people   another thing that really pissed me off was one of my team spotted an error the company made  a real big fucking error  if she hadn't spotted the company could have potentially been fined millions  no joke fucking millions  i really pushed for her to get some recognition because it was a huge finding  you know what she got  an email from an execs secretary and a  10 amazon gift voucher  this is in the same year we're being told that we probably won't get bonuses but one the execs who retired  at 50  got a 10mil leaving gift ,lwp19v
835,How to plan for a better work-life future? Or just vent inside,like many  i'm currently stuck wanting to kill myself  graduated from law school and now working in law  biggest mistake of my life   background  i'm in south africa  went to law school looking to form a solid future where i could work the 9 to 5 and enjoy my private life without worrying about extreme debt  not to be rich  but to be solid middle class  needless to say  letting 18 year old me decide what to do was a huge mistake and one that i still regret till this day  worked hard in law school and got into a job where i've been for the last 5 months  shit pay  very shit pay  working between 50 to 60 hours when my says 40  not getting paid extra by the way  constantly working so much some days that i can't catch a break to get coffee at times  however  south africa is in the midst of its largest unemployment numbers  so i should feel grateful to have a job at least  but damn is it difficult   yes  i know  i have only myself to blame   which brings me to what i wanted to ask anyone that could give me any kind of advice   i have citizenship from a eu country and want to utilize this to move to europe in the future  so i'm planning what's the best way for me to move over  and to where   my law degree doesnt help that much  because it's in south african law  plus i don't want to work in the legal field anymore due to the overworked and alcoholic steorotype being true   i was hoping to apply for general office work  or any other corporate work  which would solidify a 9 to 5 without making me work an extra minute  i thought of emailing companies and asking what a company like them might want to see in a candidate like me if i ever applied in the future   furthermore  one important thing to decide is which country to move too  i can start learning the language of the country from this year as well  one option is the netherlands because i know afrikaans and i might find the beginning to learn dutch easier this way   if anyone has any advice  comments  or insight into my plan  please comment  if you just want to vent about your shitty situation too  then shoot away  misery loves company   sorry if the text didn't make sense somewhere  i'm trying to type all of this in my great 30 minutes allocated to lunch  looking forward to any and all discussion,lws4qt

838,"Working from home has been more like what ""real"" life should be",i'd really like to hear your perspectives on this too  so please comment   i recently got a job that's 100  remote  or at least has been since covid  i used to work at a laser machining engineering firm that required me to be onsite often since we work on physical systems  so my days were often split between home and the office   things that have improved for me drastically since i switched to the fully wfh job   1  less physical tension  i realized how much tension i held in my body simply because at any moment  someone could come up behind me at my desk and surprise me ask me for something make a stupid comment  and  i don't have to stifle my emotions at any given minute - lots of energy went into that   2  i can see outside  my 2nd bedroom isn't paradise by any means  but wow  i can watch the birds on my feeder while i'm in a meeting  i can follow the course of the day  be in tune with the weather and the neighborhood    3  i am comfortable  i have a chair that i actually like  a desk that is actually high-quality  and the ability to take a moment and stretch out on the f ing floor if i want  ha  or  go for a quick walk run  plus  i am always the right temperature  no more ridiculously cold office that forced me to wear long johns even in the summer  no more uncomfortable dress shoes that destroy my feet  and my desk area is in a room that is actually painted a color  not white or gray  with furniture made out of hardwood that has personality  it's amazing how much more comfortable that is   4  i am tasting my food  i get to prepare my own fresh meals on my own schedule and relax while i eat   5  i can finish my work in less than the  required  40 hrs and not feel bad about just chilling after that  i concentrate when i need to  then i give myself a break  no one there to force me to pretend i'm still staring at something important on my screen  this has actually allowed my creativity to come back   no more numbing bullshit that exhausts me mentally and destroys my weekends    how do we keep from sliding back into the old normal once the dust settles on covid  i desperately need to continue having this balance in my life  what have your experiences been like ,lwmqo8

848,So fucking tired,i graduated from law school about 10 months ago  been working for about 8 months and i'm already sick of this shit  i live and work in india and the work culture here is one where there's absolutely no respect for your personal time  especially in the legal field  clients call you at any time  boss calls you at any time  it's a joke  even when it's a saturday or sunday nobody gives a fuck    i do a lot of transactional work and these fuckin clients show up at the last minute and set absurdly unrealistic deadlines for getting their transactions over the line  half the time just as they're about to go to bed they'll dump something on you and start asking for it first thing when they wake up  the level of entitlement is unbelievable  i'm sick of making these rich boomer men richer    i really like my coworkers and most of my friends from college face similar problems  so i'm in no way special  but i just can't anymore  my grades in college were average at best  so when i got this job i was constantly reminded by everyone how lucky i am  i get it  my grades were shit but i'm supposed to be fucking grateful to these people for squeezing as much work out of me as possible  i'm paid the equivalent of 400  a month  which to the people from the western hemisphere reading this might sound pathetic  but it's  actually not that bad in india considering the cheap cost of labour  but is still way too less for the work i'm doing    i'm repeatedly advised to stick with it because of all the  experience  i'm gaining  i get it  i am getting a lot of exposure  but in a larger sense  what's the point  all the experience i'm getting i'll use to get a job with higher pay somewhere else  but all it means is that there'll be less respect for my time and i'll just be slaving away in a different environment  we're all in the same boat i'm not trying to say i have it so much worse or something  but i read posts on here and generally on reddit about people from the states complaining about the 9-5 and honestly i feel jealous because i'd kill for a standard 9-5  here there are some days where i won't do shit until 5pm and suddenly a mountain will get dumped on me  oh and the less said about my dating life  the better  okay rant over  thanks for listening guys  mostly nothing will come of all this because i don't actually have the stones to quit and i really like the freedom the money has given me  but i really needed to get that off my chest  i find this sub really therapeutic because i get to listen to people halfway across the world bitch about the same things,lwxgtw

862,"Theoritically, rat race needs us to be obsessed with safety",in my life i've been chilling a lot especially during studies  because at that time i was the poor student with access to a  very small though  state grant  my country  france  offers some 460eur month to children of underprivileged families  i still was under pressure regarding exams  yes  because if you fail your year  you lose access to the grant  but fortunately i didn't run into trouble   at that time i was stressed a lot on my homework and learning was tough  but i still had hopes that  after that  my work life would be something more slow-paced  with my evenings being rid of any homework   just to realise it is not entirely like this   first  as usual i need to find time to fend for myself  and with my days occupied by work  some evenings are dedicated to buying a new piece of furniture  having an interview with a banker or an accountant  basically any project hat requires professional assistance  makes me think  are these people busy during the day  lots of persons have negative feelings for non-workers  but at least these non-workers can visit whatever store and counselling office they want between 9 and 5   and consume accordingly   second  the way a white-collar job demands homework is more vicious  because no one really tells you what you need to perform  and yet everyone expects you to grow at one point or another in your life  so they could promote and responsabilize you  sometimes some clues pass by  your manager mentions to you about x industry magazine or y seminar that would improve your skills   third  you get to realise the days where your transitioning to a job could be subsidized  are all gone  and if you want to transition to another industry  you are on your own  so if you grow uncomfortable in your job  then you can't even relax at evening and week-ends  because you'd be busy re-assessing your initial choice   fourth  if you need to keep your field  but change companies  basically what we call  the slave choosing his master  then you need to keep going with the complete charade of searching for a new job  but this time during your own job's clock  because when your schedule is cleared  employers' are  too  everyone gets home at 6pm right  and yet  this needs to be done quietly because openly looking for another job can lead to trouble in the workplace   fifth  maybe you are in a situation where you are underpaid and would like to start a side-gig  maybe you're working abroad and need to learn a new language  well that will be on your own  too  because such matters are considered  personal life   in conclusion  i observe a lot of the so-called personal life is spent to acquire necessary assets to please the corporate overlord  be it a potential employer or a potential customer  for small business owners   my life goals are on the side of hobbies  i want to learn useless unsellable things for myself  because i enjoy them and want to find communities with whom i can share  i also like having my hands in multiple different topics  which makes for poor commitment on my part  it is the way i am wired   i don't know where else this rambling goes  this life just makes me very tired  not everyone can sell themselves or their skills  so why just not let them be i wonder  i'm sure i have a lot of qualities that are underused by the society  just because that one size is designed for all ,lwuy32

871,I wrestle with feminism at times,one of the main points of feminism  from my perspective  was to make women enter the work place and strive for careers   i don't think that this was thoroughly thought through  because while it is obviously true that women can take on careers and go the extra mile like men can  it ultimately perpetuated our enslavement to the system   who thought it would be a good idea to make not just men wage slaves  but everyone  who thought that suffering through work was a great medium to show equality of men and women   while it has done much good  this is a major failing of the movement in my opinion ,lwrt19

883,The link between the decline of religion and less anti-workism,most people probably see the decline of religion as a good thing  and i think that's obviously true for when it's used as a tool for evil  however  at least some religions have ideas which go well with anti-workism  such as asceticism  meaning working much to buy useless stuff would be pointless  of course  you can follow such a lifestyle without being religious  but it seems rarer and maybe harder  this is just an observation on how it seems less religiosity is linked to anti-workism being a relatively small movement  and how the oppression of some religious institutions basically seems to have been replaced with the oppression of secular institutions  like corporations,lxf6fp
