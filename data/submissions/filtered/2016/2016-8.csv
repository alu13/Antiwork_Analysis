1,"Non-profit ""help people"" my ass",so i apologize if this is in the wrong place  but i have a question  my gf was recently laid of from working at the alzheimer's association  she was laid off 4-5 months after being hired because they had to make cutbacks and she was new essentially  my question is  is it fucking true that you can't get unemployment because it's a non profit  and they don't pay the whatever unemployment tax bullshit thing that actual companies do  shes never been laid off before  and has worked in non profit for years because she actually cares about people  lol  any insight would be appreciated ,4ymuv5
