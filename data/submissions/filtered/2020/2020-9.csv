0,Does anyone else with a knowledge of programming get the urge to get into cybercrime and become a digital Robin Hood?,the more i look at my other options the more shit they seem  in-house tech support pays like shit and gets no respect  working for a major tech company means terrible hours  and independent development doesn't pay enough to live on  i just want to do something that pays enough to live on  doesn't make wanna die  and leaves me with plenty of time to live my actual fucking life for fuck's sake ,j0ivgc
1,Plan your annual leave right!,hey guys    been reading this thread a lot more recently and found it helps when i m feeling unmotivated or frustrated about working  sometimes get a good laugh and it cheers me up    it s  nice  knowing others feel the same  but i found something that helped me feel better today  i put in all my annual leave  30 days  around all the busiest times during work so i will be working the bulk of my hours during the  low season  if you will and have lots of days off on mondays and fridays attached to the weekends during the peak busy times of year  this really mentally splits up the drudgery and weeks of what feels like monotony and endless work   working 3 4 day weeks makes such a difference if you re really going through it  i find staggering my holidays through out the year helps  i d get seriously depressed if i knew i didn t have annual leave for 6  months  too scared to touch any sick days until i reach 5  years continuous service    remember to take care of yourself first ,j0xvme

3,"""Class"" division among countries",as a  developing  country citizen i get bombarded everyday with media and people in general stating how great capitalism is and how wonderful it works for europe  the us and many former british empire  colonies   and how our countries in the south emisphere are shitholes and should instead embrace their free market system   these people never stop and  guess what would happen to the wealthy countries if someday africa  latin america asia and the middle east decided to stop giving their resources for nothing and providing cheap labour  how long the living standard of the global north could be mantained if suddendly their governments and corporations had to retreat from the third world  would they be as rich and powerful if they had to play fair instead of sinking peaceful nations into debt  with the world financial system or burn to ashes those that do not participate in this global scam ,j1q4mj
4,Just venting,i use to work at a beauty store  i have moved around states a lot  this specific chain is all over the nation  since working retail  it has riddled me with anxiety to the point i can t stick with anything for more than 3 months    working with the public has destroyed me  i have been called racist for telling customers to please not try on nail polish if they re not going to buy it  i ve also been bitched out by my managers for not following black customers all throughout the store  i ve also been bitched at for not chasing thieves down in the parking lot  i m not risking my life for a fucking tube of lipstick    it s so fucked  i want to make money but i don t want to be miserable doing it  i envy people who can grind it out  my family thinks i m super weak for not being able to  amp  i m often the topic of conversation so they can deflect when it comes to their flaws    i understand why some people equate work ethic to productivity  but i don t think employment should define a persons value ,j26i1s
5,What if you could choose between a pay raise or that percentage of time off?,say for example  you re due for a promotion  what if you could choose instead of a 10  raise  example only lol  you took 10  of your pay period off   and you can continue to do so each raise promotion cycle until you re working part time for that same salary or take the raise one year and the reduction in hours another  i would like to have the option  it kind of falls apart when most of us don t get raises and they re less than 5  but anyway  just a thought   personally  40 more years in front of a computer screen for 40 hours a week makes me pray for an option like this ,j1v052
6,My request for a better work computer got denied. This works to my advantage.,i deal with maps  one of the projects i'm attempting to work on for example uses topography of my county with a 1m resolution  it takes a decent computer to do that in a reasonable time  i have a decent computer aside from a graphics card  i asked for a better one but they denied it  so literally any time i do something like pan the map it takes a solid two minutes to reload  doing anything more intensive can take an hour and the computer is pretty much unusable    now i also am severely underpaid for my skillset  it's roughly half as much and a promotion was also denied because of budget constraints thanks to covid   so i guess i have a legitimate reason to be on my phone all day  i have the golden anti-work ticket   ,j21nq0

8,Office politics are absolutely killing me. I work at a grocery store.,it's a higher-end store similar to whole foods  i'm a cashier there  i've been there for a few years  it's a job that a lot of people don't want and most people don't hold onto for long  it's a loud  busy environment working with customers ranging from friendly to hostile to aggressive  sadly  there's an internal conflict in the store over who has to backup the cashiers when we start getting lines  my manager won't help us out unless she really has to and immediately returns to her office when she can  there are some staff that just refuse to have anything to do with it  others will help out  but are unhappy about it and become short with customers    the whole thing is so demoralizing because my employer is basically saying that my job sucks so bad that people fight over who will have to do it for a few minutes  but  acknowledgement of the work i do is nonexistent and compensation is restricted as much as possible  there was one employee who made a big deal about it and argued a lot with upper management about my manager not helping out  they fired him over it so now talking about it is totally taboo    i just keep thinking  god damn  this is a grocery store  how can there be so much conflict ,j2dzme

24,"It really does bother me that as far as we know, this is the only life we get, and that for many people it's hell",just imagine the one shot you get at life  and you're either born into unchanging poverty or forced to wageslave your entire life  there are such beautiful and breathtaking places in the world  which most people will never be able to see  there are so many constructive and healthy ways to occupy your time  but most people will never get that luxury  there are so many opportunities and experiences that are paywalled behind socioeconomic status  of course  i could put the blinders back on and turn off the empathy  but i can't do that        you can only be worried about yourself and what you can control  yes  i could do that  but worrying about ourselves is exactly why we're in this mess to begin with  we  as a supposedly  intelligent species  absolutely do not look out for each other  and it's sad to say that it's all by design  if people actually had the ability to help each other without putting their own security at risk  the system wouldn't function  it thrives on brutal competition  what good is capitalism if people aren't stepping all over each other  right       it's just frustrating  because it's not like this is a unique struggle  throughout human history there's always been a ruling class and some sort of oppressed  working-serf class  and every single time  the working class is slowly broken over and over and over again  dead ass though  this story gets old as hell  like how many times are we gonna do this same song and dance  at what point in time does the human species finally breakaway from these broken and unfair systems forever  and why in the hell did i have to be born into it  i don't want this shitty timeline ,j25g9n

27,Corporalism and Grey Skies,currency floats in our society  so much that currency is technically both in an absurd abundance as well as simultaneously being invisibly transparent  the 80 20 rule is very much so evident in the case of corporalism and currency  as a cohesive society  we spend our absolute most significant resources both in the form of technology and humans themselves  in order to scrape on and off floating currencies out of corporalist jobs  some humans are brilliant  their value lies in their skillsets and mind  most humans are hard-working  their value lies in their numbers and lack of voice   considering the topic and reflecting  it would be easy to conclude that this is in fact just how it is  we spend our resources both individually and collectively to satisfy the corporal  there is constantly a corporal cog that requires motion in the form of human fuel  to break the cog would not singly do good nor singly do harm  there is no longer any distinction between them  a person x free of the cog is a person free of civilization  and any person that x desires to interact with also has to be a person free of civilization  too  as minimal as the act of existing within a country s borders would threaten the person x s freedom  as well would the act of purchasing an egg for breakfast   despite unable to achieve freedom from the cog  there are people thriving and blossoming  one explanation would be to label the thriving as members of the 20  they are on the forefront when it comes to corporal interests  meaning they have skillsets of actual use to the rest of the 20  the thriving ranges from the happy independent freelancers that makes enough money to sustain themselves  to the ultrawealthy oligarchs that lives in unbelieveable luxury  in common is their service to the cog  the oligarch s money is a symbol of time  quite literally translating to a member s ticket that is consumed constantly but never exhumed due to its near infinite pool of content  the cog does not operate in morality  fuel is fuel  meanwhile the freelancer is granted the privilege of a single ticket every once in a while  completely independently as opposed to a worker from the 80s  the freelancer celebrates the usage of the ticket and experiences both the joy of individual labor as well as the relief of cog duty   to differentiate between the individual laborers of the 20s and all of the 80s  one has to look at the source of one s labor  while the 80s  labor is very rigidly given from a higher hierarchical position  the 20s  labor is always operating as equals devoid of hierarchies  this gives enormous power and often a sense of pride to the 20s  granting individual  creative freedom  if one pictures the cog duty ending by physically inserting one s ticket into it  the 20s are always the ones doing the inserting  as opposed to the never-included 80s  in that sense  cog duty could be entirely similar and even worse off for 20s compared to 80s  meaning a member of the 20s could have labor so horrible and soul-drenching while the member of the 80s could work in offices of gold and glitter with aesthetics luxurious  the difference lies in the freedom of the two  the 80s member owns nothing of value to the cog  the 20s member has value and opportunities    this symbolical ended cog duty is another word for time given  because of this definition one can further include another set of members to the 20s  the hobbyists  as time given is a signal for your mind to turn towards personal interests  one could kill two birds with one stone by working with hobbies within 20s conditions  as one goes to insert one s ticket into the cog  one could already be filled with hours and hours of eustress and satisfaction only personal projects could grant  one could even argue one would not need the time given at all  because the time taken is all one needs  there is no point in differentiating freelancers and hobbyists  one could be both and one could be either  but the most important is to differ them from the 80s ,j2165p

48,Breaking my programming but feeling bad about it...,from 18 to 30 i worked my ass off starting in telemarketing at about  7 an hour and ending in commercial debt collections at about  40 an hour  i have a bunch of experience but i realized that happiness was worth more to me than money and i didn't like the person i was becoming    since then i've taken jobs that are  below me  or at least below my experience level  the job that i'm currently at and have been at for a year in the interview the interviewer said the resume speaks for itself but the only question i have is why didn't you move up in previous positions   i was just completely honest i said i don't kiss ass and i made a lot more money on the phone  call center work  than moving up and baby-sitting other human beings   i was given the job  but i think he expected me to quit pretty quickly knowing that i would be making a lot less money than i could be somewhere else   sometimes i feel like the grass would be greener somewhere else  like i'm not living up to my true potential  but i also know the kind of unhappiness that leads to  i feel so damn programmed sometimes and i don't have any friends that feel the same way  most of my friends and family are in that ambition mindset of  work hard so i can hopefully retire some day    i went from living beyond my means  drinking too much  and thinking very highly of myself to a very simple life  my job has great hours  weekends off  pays my bills and leaves me a small savings  i live in a small trailer  i moved to a warm climate  i'm 2 5 years sober  and i live very minimalistic  i am less stressed out even with less money coming in but i still feel this pulling within like i have to or should be working harder  doing better  making more money    honestly if i could figure out a way to make money i would live in a small rv or van and travel the us because i know the odds of retirement are slim and in the end having limited mobility and money van be an ugly and depressing existence   well idk if anyone has experienced this but i just kind of needed to rant ,j1bxpi
49,Is HR always like this in large corporations?, so i go into orientation and for the most part  it s fine  but then the lead starts talking about paying for college  she asked me where i went to school and how i was paying for it  i said community college and a scholarship was paying for it  she said to me in a demeaning way   ohh must be nice  i thought okay maybe she was screwing with me  then i went to do my computer based learnings and she told me to do them  however she didn t tell me what to do afterwards  so she left and i was oblivious on what to do since she didn t let me know she was leaving or what i was supposed to do next  then i thought okay maybe she forgot  then the tip of the iceberg was when i was talking to her about scheduling  this person just sat there on their phone while talking with me  to me  that is so rude and unprofessional and it pissed me off to know end  does anybody else have a bad experience with hr not seeming to care ,j1lamm

53,Put in my two weeks today. Never felt better.,long story short my job was monotonous  voluminous  and unsustainable  workload was getting worse and worse  i work ed  in a field where we got busier during covid and then our company got transferred over along with the rest of the workload and the last 2-3 weeks have been nothing short of hell  new systems etc  plus monotony and never ending shit   i knew it was time to leave when my family asked if i was going to visit them on sunday  an hour or so drive  and i told them i couldn t because i was so burnt and drained  i literally spent all weekend on the couch  lifeless    i was like  is this me  wtf  i can t even see my family i m so drained in every possible way  no  no no no  fuck this shit    i m taking a break from working  i understand my job is abnormally insane with workload but i need a month or two off  i ll figure it out  i can t live like this anymore  nobody in my office talks  barely anybody laughs  it s tense  stressful  and all i hear is clicking of mouses and typing on keyboards  coupled with people on the phone here and there   nope   i have an interview for a wfh position that i really hope i get but honestly i wouldn t be opposed to some time off  this job has compromised my sense of self enough where i need to quit before i burn out completely  i tried to nap earlier and i couldn t because my brain felt like a burnt out vacuum that wouldn t start   fuck work  i am more valuable than mindlessly faxing things up to 85 times a day as well as reaching out on 86-100 tjinhs plus any side tasks or emails voicemails we need to handle    i ll miss my boss and maybe two co workers  i can t wait to feel like myself again   fuck jobs that make you feel like a hamster in a wheel that never stops spinning ,j2bftd

58,"Hired on as a cashier, now doing courtesy.",just like the title said  when i went in for the interview it was for a cashier position   now however i work every weekday doing anything but cash   courtesy is essentially the store labourers  i will do anything and everything from changing garbages  pushing rows of 7-10 carts  and sanitizing them due to covid   climbing an extension ladder to do the billboard outside  etc   i specifically told my current boss at the time of the interview that cashing would be a great asset for my resume and also a transferable skill   unfortunately though  i was on cash for maybe a months top from being hired  now everything i do is completely unrelated   supposedly they re short staffed  but management says the store isn t hiring   which makes 0 sense if you re short staffed   the biggest issue i have is that i actually don t mind cash at all   like i said it s a skill that can be easily transferable  but before these courtesy shifts took over i actually didn t mind my workplace  co-workers are great  it s a fairly good atmosphere  even management was decent   but doing a completely different job from what i was hired on is so mentally and physically draining i could care less about my co-workers  courtesy is far more physical than cash and is basically non-stop doing various tasks back and forth at a very fast pace   i ve voiced concerns that this  wasn t what i was hired on for and have got back exactly a single 4 hour cash shift in like the past 1 5 months   another thing that is obnoxious to say the least is that i have never actually went on my breaks on time   the 15 minute break is always late  no matter what day circumstances and if my 30 minute lunch break isn t late it s completely forgotten   the store acts like they want you to go on your breaks and constantly remind you early on  only to tell you to do a task like 10-5 minutes before your break   resulting in a later missed one   and obviously it pays minimum wage and has little opportunity to advance or get a raise   every single shift i do is just so exhausting  all i am capable of doing after is watching tv and going to bed   heck i even struggle to fall asleep knowing i ll be doing it again   that s my little lecture here  i m trying to keep on pushing for cashier shifts  but if i don t see any changes upcoming i ll probably push past the line and decide to find a new job   i don t mind the company  co-workers  even the previous job  the one i was hired for  but what i m doing now is honestly so tedious and boring it really is a mood killer ,j264mb

62,"What type of company do you work for, and are you organizing at your job?",i'm really interested in labor organizing as a tool in a program of broader change  i work at a small-ish retail company  around 100 employees over three local branches  and we've been working with a national union to organize for an election to establish a local at our workplace  it's been slow going getting the votes we need to file for an election with the national labor relations board  but we're almost there    it's a little scary  the business has been hit hard by the pandemic and consequent shutdown measures  capacity limits and people just not wanting to risk exposure to shop in person  there's been talk of the business closing if our city has to shut down non-essential businesses again  we can operate during a shutdown but it cuts incoming revenue by a lot  i'm a little afraid that if we file for an election the owners will just close the business  however  the union we're working with has helped a few of their locals seize their workplaces after closures and run them as collectively owned worker co-ops  that would be the dream   i think that the collective bargaining power national union backing could give us would make our jobs better  my workplace is also quite prestigious within its industry and in the city where i live  so if we're successful  that also gives us an opportunity to serve as an example of what successful labor organizing can look like in an industry that is typically union-free  it'd be nice to think that we could contribute to the strengthening of labor unions somehow   businesses are really afraid of unions  amazon recently notified their employees that they're being monitored for labor organizing activities  this is illegal intimidation  but the fines amazon would face if a complaint were filed mean nothing to them  however  people are still working to organize at amazon  think of the change that could be achieved by a concerted effort to organize all amazon drivers  programmers and warehouse workers  if it was twenty-five percent successful just in one branch of operations  amazon wouldn't be able to fight it  for instance  if one distribution center organized and filed for an election  amazon would immediately close that center  if 25 percent of their distribution centers filed for elections simultaneously  they'd have a harder time quashing it  i don't mean to downplay the work of people already organizing at amazon  i'm saying they're doing good work  and they have a real chance at gaining some say in the material conditions of their employment   how do y'all feel about labor organizing  what size company do you work at  i've been purposely vague about what we sell because i don't want to risk exposing our organizing efforts at all  do you think unionizing your workplace could make your job tolerable ,j2k92s

68,Working by Gaslight in the time of COVID,tldr employers are monsters and life is terrible  this is a dumb rant    ---  today in my work inbox was a letter from the hourly employees rep about a talk with the administration about employment security going forward  ie  how there's no security  no big surprise  but this blurb got me    gt nevertheless  as sobering as the above uncertainty might sound  the absolute last thing monsters university wishes to do   to any of its employees   is abandon them  this is why employees were paid 100  of their wages through june 30th even if no hours were scheduled  this is why employees  the current priority being those who haven t been scheduled since june 30th  have been shifted to available positions in other departments when their position ended instead of being let go entirely  desertion and mistreatment are not items on the agenda     gt     gt vp james p  sullivan provided one sweeping example of a group of employees reassigned to different positions from what they were initially assigned  our lifeguards  given that our pool is closed until further notice  but our outside track is open to the public  our lifeguards are currently employed as  safety ambassadors  on the track  monitoring for safety and enforcing social distancing  this does not mean that when the pool reopens they won t be lifeguards again  just that in the interim their position has changed  and they are still earning wages   names have been changed to protect  me  from a defamation suit or something  i don't know   i spent most of june fighting to get paid for weeks of work that my supervisor did not want to pay me for while also fighting for them to tell me what my hours actually were  or if i had been fired or not  hr and business services  the latter of which sully is vp  were places i contacted for help mediating this  and a botched screencap text message revealed that those folks were all coordinating to craft emails to send to me under my supervisor's name in order to gaslight me into dropping my claim   i did not  by the way  and forwarded that fumble along to the state along with the rest of the correspondence and eventually got my wages back  but certainly not anything like the '100  of wages' that the rep letter said  the fight to learn how many hours they wanted me to work or not also made applying for unemployment a real treat and i lost weeks of benefits due to that   the bit about the lifeguards was the real thumb into the wound though  as it was actually a clever way to keep people on the payroll  but while they were coming up with that idea they were trying to screw me while i am doing a job that is meaningful and so difficult to replace that they won't fire me   it bothered me so much in such a cold pit-in-your-chest way that i had to write the rep a lengthy letter rebutting the assertion with the details of my experience and talking about the emotional and financial toll it took on me and my family   the letter was long so i won't post it  but i wanted to post the snip from the last paragraph because it described just how bad i'm feeling right now    gt but i nonetheless think that sentiment should have been applied to  going forward and not to where we have been  because the amusement is only a tinge to a deep lonely sadness at seeing such cleverness be applied to re-employing people whose jobs are literally useless right now while the only effort put into addressing my continuing struggle to stay above water was to push me further down   so this isn't a post that will really grease up your guillotine  i admit  i just wanted to shout into the void  or at the void  because that's better than just sitting there as the void passes over  and i hope it passes over quickly   i feel sad but also a hard-to-describe sense of disappointment  which i called loneliness in my response  in the repeated demonstrations that the people who hold my fate in their hands are not just cruel but incredibly careless and too stupid to be effective in their goals  when your hurts are inflicted by someone clever or practiced it feels  somehow  a little less shameful  especially if you succeed in the end  but i do feel shame  even if i should not  to be put in such desperate circumstances by the sparring equivalent of a drunken walrus falling down a flight of stairs ,j24idk

95,Would I need to work 40 hours a week to get by?,so i'm 19 and live in new zealand  i'm looking for work  around 30 - 35 hours per week at the very most  so i can save up and my friend and i can rent a place out  he's keen for 40 hours or over  but that amount of work would suck the soul out of me  even 35 hours would be pretty hard on me mentally  he's adamant that even if we rented a cheap 2 bedroom house  we would struggle to survive  counting rent  fuel  water  internet  power and food  he says we'd need to make at the minimum  700 a week between us to get by  but if i'm working 30 hours and he's working 40 that's  1100  even more if he works longer  it doesn't seem like we wouldn't be able to survive on that money  but he's certain that my perception is warped having never lived independently  and it's going to be a lot harder than i imagine  he's trying to convince me to work more  and dismisses any reasoning i give him for not wanting to as  being lazy  but i'd much rather live paycheck to paycheck and have all i need  as well as plenty of free time to do what i actually want to do  and if i can survive on 30 hours with just that  i'm fucking happy ,j2kjeh
96,Just had 2 weeks of holiday and realised a lot,hey   i just got 2 weeks of holiday after almost a year of working all the time  im a father of a 1 year old baby and in this 2 weeks  i could finaly not only spend time with my little girl  but the quality was also above than when i get out of work or even at the weekends   why  because after working 8 sometimes 9 hours  i just dont have the  mood  and energy for anything  i play a bit with my baby after work  we eat together and then its already time to put her to sleep  which is everything exhausting after a shity work day  on this 2 week breaks i happily bathed her and we played 30min after and we read a book and then i put her to sleep  i liked it cause i wasnt out of energy  on weekends i need 1 day to recover and on sunday you already have this mental feeling of getting to work  i never liked sundays  best feeling for your mental health is to know you got 1 or 2 weeks as a buffer to work  this only clears your head  weekend barely does it for me    my point here is with this rambling is  that work also destroys your time with your own children  i mean how many fathers  or working mothers  waste their time with work instead of bonding time with their own fucking children  my father i remember was working 6 days a week and didnt do anything with me  i dont want to be like this  im very lucky that i only have 10min to work  so on lunch break i go home and after work i dont have to a slave and waste time with a car i just walk home    any parents here feel the same  i actualy would like to work 6 hours a day since the last 2 hours are the ones that fucking with my energy but yeah  goodbye money    anyway  time to go to work ,j1szux

122,Work killed the happiness inside of me. Just leave me alone and let me be work at my own pace,after trying about 6 jobs in my 20s i ve come to realize that no matter what i do i ll always hate work  i hate sucking up to bosses and acting like i enjoy seeing my coworkers  i hate having that pressure to constantly produce results and prove myself  i use to believe in genuinely befriending coworkers  helping each other out  and working together to achieve a common goal we can all be proud of  but the corporate life has sucked it out of me  everyone in the office always gives off the vibe that they only care about themselves and that they re ready to throw each other under a bus if needed  everything is so fake a superficial    my boss always tells me that he s here for me and wants to see me succeed but every time we meet  he also hounds me about how i m not progressing fast enough  how i m learning too slow  how i don t understand this or that  how he wants me to grow faster  never really asks me how i am or how i m feeling and dives straight into asking me what i ve accomplished for the week  if i didn t complete something fast enough for his standards he flies off the walls  he likes to tell me how when he was in my position he always completed his assignments before the deadline and went above and beyond to contribute to the company  obviously all he s not really here for me  it sounds more like he s just here to see what i ve produced  and to tell me to work faster so the company can get more out of me for less  what if i don t care about progressing fast  what if i just want to go at my own slow pace  what if i don t want to be an overachiever at the cost of my mental and physical wellbeing  why can t people just be satisfied with me doing the bare minimum  everyone learns and grows at their own pace  and everyone has their own life goals too  my job requirements never said  must be a hard worker and plough through work as fast as you can so you can take on more  if they want me to work faster  work more  then they should offer to pay me more too    i ve gotten to the point where i don t give a flying fuck about getting promoted or being the top performing employee  because it seems like the harder i work the more responsibilities i get and the more people expect of me  sure i might get a small raise or recognition but compared to the torture i have to go through to get it  no thanks  i m not hurting anyone by doing the bare minimum  and i don t think anyone should be looked down upon for doing so  when has being a super fast and hard worker been the standard    i don t even know what my point in writing this is  other than i m so sick of working  the fake company cultures  and being pressure to perform  this subreddit is the only place where i feel like i can find people who understand me  i m just so sick of working and wasting my youth doing things i hate for money  it s like no one is ever happy  with just enough  everyone always wants more more more out of their employees  it s always all about results and numbers  all this company talk of  we re one big family  is a lie  it s like just let me be  let me be as lazy as i want as long as i deliver the bare minimum  which is what is only required of me anyway  let me live life at my own pace instead of constantly comparing me to other more experienced  higher performing people and asking me why i can t be like them  how about saying for once  even though you re not progressing at the pace i m use to  i can see that you re learning and slowly getting better  how fast you want to progress in this career and company is up to you so as long as you re happy and delivering the minimum  we re good  instead of  i gave you this assignment and expected you to complete it faster  when i was in your position i completed assignments like this way faster than you  this wasn t even that hard to do so i don t understand why you re so slow ,j1njck

169,Work seen as a blessing!,please be kind to me  this is my first post here    i was born as a girl child  in india  to an  upper middle class educated  family  education was thrust on me  competition was thrust upon me  i participated in a competitive exam to get selected in top 50 students amongst 7 million people who applied  i joined  went through horrible bullying which almost broke me  i couldn't take it anymore   but when i called back home to say i am breaking down  i was told that if i come back home  i will be married off to a person i haven't even met  this was not presented as a threat  just a reality of life and reality of survival  it was presented to me as a blessing that as an indian woman i was being given an option to be independent and work rather than be a subservient housewife   i was scared  i persevered  did very well in university  did well through initial stages of my work life   despite the numerous sexual advances of my seniors offered in exchange for career growth  which i categorically resisted  yes that's what an independent woman in 1990's india had to go through    i ended up moving out of india to australia and ultimately settling down in uk as i wanted to get away from all the shit i was getting as a working woman in india  also i felt the work-life balance is better anywhere outside of india   i fooled myself for years that i was lucky i escaped  i have a well paid job and i am not being looked down upon for it or being exploited for it    but  i broke down in my late 30's  went into therapy  i am surviving on medication now  i still hold my job  i am psychologically dependent on it as it was drilled into my mind since i gained conciousness that career is critical to my survival    starting to thing though  where am i going  is it all worth it  is this all there is to life ,ixv0fl

190,Possible solutions for not working. Solution 1: Homeless by choice,i have been brainstorming a bit and have been pouring over options for not working   there's been a lot of commiserating lately which is fine and good  but no real solutions    so lets discuss   each week  i want to discuss possible solutions  no matter how crazy  after all  hardcore problems need hardcore solutions  nor is one solution going to be for everyone   we also need to define  work  the way i define  work  in it's negative context is any activity where you are doing the inconvenient or unpleasant stuff so an employer or owner does not have to while the owner or employer does not pay you enough to eventually not do such things or ever  get ahead   let's talk about probably the most controversial of solutions - being  homeless by choice   while this sub tends to focuses on the employer  landlords take up half  or more  of income    if landlords can be eliminated  more resources can be put towards owning things - even perhaps an inexpensive house in a less than desirable area  or whatever agenda   on the surface this one is simple  if not hardcore as hell and requires balls of steel  you simply reduce what you own down to bare necessities and live in either a car or go grab a tent and stealth camp in wooded areas that get little traffic and hopefully remain undiscovered   i do not recommend shelters unless absolutely necessary because of strict rules not compatible with freedom  safety  and the fact most homeless services exist primarily for salaries often to the tune of hundreds of thousands or to spread cult like religions among a captive audience    positives    - with no ties  you can literally go anywhere  dream job in another state  you can move    - you literally have nothing to lose  job treating you bad  what are they going to do  make you homeless  you laugh in their face    - if you do work  all that money can be put towards whatever agenda you want  be this eventually buying a cheap house in the ghetto  staying high or drunk  which many do  saving up for a plane ticket to a better country or area with better prospects  whatever  you could work 2 jobs and it's all yours  and  unless you are homeless in some expensive  overyped area like san franscisco you could have quite a nest egg    - you are not scrambling around the first of the month  zero stress from owing people    - it can be revolutionary  the stories of the rail kids of the 90s  abbie hoffman  and  some- not the posers in it for ad views  the people on youtube are real  you are sticking your thumb up at society and their machinations       negatives    - this can not really be done if you have children or a family  social services literally hang out in places homeless seek services taking away kids    - you have to be somewhat mentally and physically strong  this is lots of walking for necessities  also  lonely and can be demeaning aggravating existing mental conditions    - while it is not illegal per se not to own or rent a place  many communities make activities of daily living illegal  it is illegal to hang around a place without buying something  sleeping  using the bathroom  or pretty much existing  this can be mitigated by scouting out hidden locations  but in extreme urbanized environments with too many homeless already this may not be possible and works better in medium sized towns rather than mega metropolises    - no storage  you either have to hide stuff or literally carry everything with you  clothes alone are very bulky and heavy and gets dirty and begins to smell  anything left outside is considered abandoned so you have no recourse if stuff comes up missing  it is possible to get a cheap storage unit  but you can't live there and there may come a point where storage fees can exceed the value of what you are storing versus merely replacing things    - you have less legal rights on foot or in a car than in a apartment or house  cops have been known to  stop and frisk  or haul in people on questionable suspicions who  look homeless    - hygiene  with no access to bathrooms and showers  it is harder to keep clean and this can hamper people's opinions  there are work arounds like gym memberships  the occasional hotel room  and carrying wet washcloths  but each has it's shortcomings    - you are passively hunted  people don't like homeless  they want them to go away  this can be mitigated by  not looking homeless    - social standing  will lose friends  possibly spouses lovers  must hide from others because of stigma  this can be worked around through presentation  hell  you aren't  homeless  you are a green urban explorer    thoughts ,izi2sb

200,Check out this boomer employer/landlord of mine...,i have been working for this woman who is in her 70s for a year now  it's a camp host position with lots of acreage surrounded by national forest  it's so beautiful out here  the kicker is i get to live out here for free  but there is no pay whatsoever  it doesn't matter how hard i work out here  i still get nothing  she has visited the property a total of two times since i've worked here  she barely ever responds to my emails and calls  now that oregon winter is fast-approaching  she wants to know everything about my past  says if i want to keep this job  and a place to live  i have to sign some documents  for it to be legal    the previous camp hosts were given a credit card from her and ran up tons of cash advances  since they had control over the website and facebook page  when they got caught  they held those things for ransom essentially  they posted lies and left them up  potentially killing tons of business  we've had guests mention their serious concerns so i can only imagine the folks that didn't bother to inquire  but that's my fault apparently    we've been dealing with the pandemic  wildfire smoke  guests don't want to bring horses to exercise in that for weeks after sky clears  the owner's refusal to invest money in the business  we had to turn guests away because there is no working bathroom  only an outhouse  and the ongoing website facebook crisis  but that's my fault too apparently    this is the email i got this morning  removed personal details    thank you  name  for the information but i need you to elaborate more on    the college experience  you said your gi bill ran out because it was expensive for-profit school  why did you choose that collage  you said you worked and went to collage  where did you work etc  etc  while attending college  how long did you spend in the service  how long did you work at the  last occupation  in  town   why was your position terminated    what are you getting in aid per month  yourself  and your mother    business name  comes first because it is a business  our business  the sixth  business  we created   not bought  not handed down  one of 6 over a span of 60 years of time that we have 10 years of blood  sweat  and tears as well as 100's of thousands of dollars invested in just this one the same as everyone else who made it into the 3  i am not sure nor do i presume in any way that you are of this mentality but for the record  i personally after working with those of your generation have come to a conclusion that they have no concept of what it takes to just manage a business let alone create your own business working every day 24 7  18 hr or more year after year denying yourself of everything except the absolute necessities to survive for a pittance never taking your eye off your goal watching that pittance grow into a substantial nest egg or enough to start that dream rolling and seeing that dream come into reality  education  iq nor money has anything to do with success  grit is no  1  and was describes once as the tiny piece of sand in the oyster that turns into the pearl and that is so true but it takes a long time  perseverance  never  never give up   i have seen over and over this generation wants to start at the top but has no grit no drive  no reality  or concept of real-life skills  i lay most of this on parenting or lack thereof  well i got carried away but could write a book on this subject  as you have witnessed it only takes a couple of toxic millennials such as  previous camp host  1  and  previous camp host  2  who in my educated view are exemplary or void of all real-life reality and skills coning their way through life because they believe they deserved that certificate of achievement for merely getting out of bed each day and to hell with everyone else  yet i saw qualities in both of them that were phenomenal but used for evil especially  camp host  2  has shown and continues to display narcissistic personality which of course has nothing to do with millennials    it is critical that i as ceo of the company make sure i have the best people at  business name  in order to secure its future  you are there because of my decision which was i still believe to be morally correct but as you are aware that was temporaryor like i said to give me time to figure out the future    when you found out about  business name  facebook site being trashed you said you could fix that  and insissted on doing so which impressed me  i made it clear to you i could not and did not have the time to do that but she has not done this   i gave you numbers to call for a person to work with to help fix this  i told you that needed to be taken care of asap    if our circumstances were normal i would have worked day and night on behalf of this business but i have not seen this commitment so it is time i make decisions to mitigate further damage by pursuing the best people to continue at  business name   so  once again i believe you could be a deserving asset but if you are thinking you are there or staying because of your own circumstances that will not be acceptable    i also want to re-iterate that  new camp manager  move or not to move nov 1st has not been decided     just so you will no  small children were not in the picture last march nor will it be in the best interest that they be allowed there now   business name  is in no way a homeless camp  i expect to be notified in advance of any significant changes that affect  business name  or my ability to manage what is going on out there  if it does not enhance the business which in the future will enhance everyone's future it will probably not happen    your questions are welcome   ------    we recently had a large horse event here and people told me they've never seen the property look so good     my position wasn't terminated  i quit so that i could spend my time on this business  but she just assumes i was terminated      i don't know why she referred to herself as ceo  she owns the property and business  but it's not traded      she made up this story that i agreed to fix her website and facebook page  apparently for free too like everything else  it's her business that she would work 18 hours a day to make it work she claims  but is unwilling to do anything about the website facebook page for a year now  but now that she realized the business isn't making money she wants to point the finger at me      the previous camp hosts had a small boy so i don't know what the hell she's talking about     after a year she just decided she gets to demand to know everything about me and make me sign documents     in the previous email i told her i was a homeless veteran before this job so that's why she responded that she doesn't want there to be a homeless camp  this coming from the woman who cries in christianity every chance she gets     she said she might be hiring a camp manager to take over the house so i may not even have access to laundry shower fireplace etc during the winter  it's all up in the air and has been for the last two weeks  extremely stressful   sorry for the rant  but i had to get this off my chest and i'm hoping for some advice on what to do here  if i sledgehammer her email to bits  it will put my job and living situation in even more jeopardy  all this right as winter here is approaching fast ,izngzj

214,I'm just a Temp.,if any of you have ever been temp workers  you can probably relate to this   got out of a very pointless meeting today  two regular government workers talking down to 8 of us temp contract workers  for context  all eight of us are paid the minimum  about  14 hr   agency takes a few bucks  so closer to  11-12     regular workers in this office get  22  an hour as well as a bunch of benefits that we don't get  paid sick leave  vacation  holidays paid  med insurance  etc    the point of this meeting was to let everyone know that they would be expanding job tasks to match those of their current government lab admin staff  more work  zero additional compensation  bonus  they've let us know there's a 99  guarenteed chance of being let go once our contracts are up   luckily  i'm leaving in a week anyway  but they asked for feedback  turning to me specifically as i had been there the longest out of all the temps     i'm just a temp worker  we were hired on to assist in data entry only   they looked at me like i had five heads and asked what the big deal was  again  this office has specialists  folks with degrees  who have been here for many years  we're all just 4-6month temp workers with very few protections as well as very little compensation  i don't mind hard work  but i hate the entitlement mindset some places have    a week ago they were gloating to themselves that they were able to snag someone way way overqualified for a particular laboratory position  they were so happy that they got her on a contract for  only  15 an hour   this position is for a permanent job  but they're making her go to an agency first- even though they already plan on hiring keeping her  fair compensation is just as much a joke nowadays in government work as it is in many public sectors   bonus  the office was closed the other day  everyone on paid leave  my boss asked in advance what i'd be doing that day  i pointed out that i'll need to work   somewhere else  to make up for the lost day of pay  she laughed and pointed out that i'm already compensated to take the day off  i explained to her that i and all the other contracters are actually not paid for any kind of leave  she said   that's weird  and left   ,ixtxdz

246,"Family will never understand me, and bootlickers will never understand us.",so earlier this afternoon  in my final attempt to explain my issues with work  which itself is just one part of my many issues with society  i tried to convince my mother to read david graeber s  bullshit jobs  figuring that another being can explain my issues better than i can  of course  i couldn t convince my mother to read a whole book  so i directed her to an article that explains the book  which i m pretty sure she just thoughtlessly skimmed through   tonight i hear my mother laughing with my sister about how i tried to explain the article to the former and they talked about how i recognized that there were jobs that had  no value   my definition being jobs that don t need to exist  like every corporate level job  except to them   no value  meant anything low paying  and they were talking about how i should  move on  from my low-paying retail job   if only it were that easy   sigh why do i never learn  it s impossible to educate a certain part of the populace  and i m beginning to wonder if we re going to need extreme fascistic measures to ensure our ideal world  why should we allow people who can t learn to get in our way ,iyo7aj

255,I'm working my job with one foot out the door and can't wait to leave.,i posted this is in another sub and they said i should post it here   5 years ago my now-wife and i moved to salt lake city for her phd   long story short  i got a programming job right out of school  got laid off after 6 months  got another it-related job  and have been there ever since   good pay  good pto  working from home full time these days  pretty chill altogether   but in the past year or so  i came to this conclusion  i don't want to do it anymore   i'm tired of helping people with their it problems  who are often angry and frustrated  i hate programming  and i don't care about keeping up to date on the latest tech or getting certifications or anything   i just want out   the only thing that's holding me back is that while my wife is getting her phd  i'm the main money-maker for us  so we can't really afford for me to start over with something i'd genuinely want to pursue   aside from my wife  our dog  and my couple main hobbies  the only thing i care about is animals   i'm pretty knowledgeable about animals in general  especially wolves and komodo dragons  but i don't have a degree in wildlife biology or ecology or anything like that  and i really don't want to go back to school   i felt trapped  like how am i going to get out   so i've just hunkered down and kept working   but recently my wife started talking about graduating  saying she has enough data to write a thesis on  so she's going to talk with her lab director about it   her aim is to graduate next fall and get a job soon after   we've talked about it and if our financial situation is right once she gets a job  my plan is to get a relatively low-stress job with a wildlife sanctuary  zoo  animal shelter  or government department of wildlife just doing administrative or clerical work   i wouldn't be working directly with the animals  but at least i'd be less stressed and working for a place where i actually give a shit about what they do   ever since coming to that conclusion and having an actual plan for the future  i've been so excited   it's the light at the end of the tunnel   the exit door   i'm comforted by the sheer idea of leaving   and because of that  i'm basically working my current job with one foot out the door   i'm emotionally checked-out   i feel less rushed and overwhelmed by work  we're a team of 3 doing the job of 10  because i just don't care anymore   i still do all my work correctly and in a timely fashion  but i just do the bare minimum now   i'm more frank and honest with clients about things rather than trying to sugarcoat them to keep them from freaking out further   i'm more stoic rather than having to put on a fake smile to seem interested in my work   all in all  it just feels good to have a sense of direction and knowing that the current situation is only temporary and close to being over ,iyff7x
256,Going back to work,i want to apologize in advance  this is mostly a rant  and i don't know where else to do it     the last time i had a job  i lost 8lbs in 6 months  was constantly physically sick  my bipolar episodes were worse and more frequent  and i had acute kidney failure at one point  i spent do much of my time angry and crying  i couldn't even enjoy my time off because i almost never got consecutive days off   i stopped going to work a few years back when i was pregnant for my own health and for the sake of the baby  my husband had a salary position that he was fairly happy with  that gave him weekends and holidays off  and a fair amount of paid leave days  but he doesn't have that job anymore  and our financial situation has changed    his new job pays more than minimum wage  and covers most of our expenses  but not all of them  we're a few hundred dollars a month short    his new job is online from home so we can't switch internet plans for a cheaper one  we can't get cheaper phone plans until our contracts are up in another year  we just moved to a place with cheap rent so we can't cut anymore costs there    i'm going to have to find a job that works opposite to my husbands work schedule so we won't have to pay for childcare  we will barely see eachother anymore  his new job already has late hours so we're not going to bed or waking up together  if i'm working on days he's off  then we'll only see eachother a few hours a day   i hate this  i love being creative  and doing things  but it is incredibly hard to make a living off of the things that i genuinely like to do  i'm really trying to make it work so i can be home with my family  but i don't know if i can    i'm doing freelance photography  but  so far  i only have 1 session booked for next month  i live near the ocean so i've been collecting stones and shells on the beach to make jewelry with  i've only just started so i haven't put anything up for sale yet  i don't know if i'll be able to make enough money from it  but i'm really hopeful  i'm also trying to write a book  but i know that authors don't actually make much  unless they make the best sellers list    i really don't want to go back into a conventional workplace environment  it will suck the life out of me again  i hate this  why is there no value put on what i have to offer ,iy19ce

273,But how? And what’s next?,i understand the concept of not working our lives away and agree that their needs to be a refocus on life happiness family etc  but if we don t have people working all the time what will there be to do  no outings no tours no flights  or is the plan to go back to a homestead style communal living  i would be down for that too but unfortunately we loose the technology no more internet or tv and life expectancy will go down without the production of medical equipment and drugs  it would obviously need a complete restructure of our world and a large shift of the overton window but is having our lives outside of work worth it when we spend our time out of work just surviving like we had to a few hundred years in the past   tl dr we stop working but what s next  not against the idea just want to understand the methodology ,izmbap

284,Watched “The Founder” on Netflix last night and it got me thinking. My thoughts...,released in 2016 but somehow i d missed it til now  it s based on the story of how mcdonald s became the mega corp we know today   basically  the  background  given in the exposition of the movie is that two brothers  dick and mac mcdonald  opened their first mcdonald s restaurant in san bernardino in the 30s  during the great depression  after many years of struggling to make a living  by the 50s  they had a booming business model as the first successful  fast food  restaurant that challenged the outdated drive-in model  they worked hard  and their restaurant was a high success that they cared for and loved deeply  they put their hearts and passion into the restaurant  and were very content with their success   the entire arc of the movie  however  focuses on ray kroc  a sleazy business man hell-bent on turning mcdonald s into a franchise  through lots of complicated twists and turns  he eventually gets the brothers to agree to a contract to let him expand the restaurant and he starts opening franchises in cities across america  at first he seems to share the love and passion of the brothers  caring as deeply as they do about the restaurants and just wanting to spread the name  but over the course of the film  he becomes blinded by greed  money influence and power  he starts screwing over the brothers and  bastardizing  mcdonald s standards in order to make more money  he starts recruiting his friends and trying to shimmy his way up the status ladder  his marriage begins falling apart and all he can focus on is how to make more money and gain more influence  at one point in the movie  he says to his wife  wow look at how happy this husband-wife couple i recruited to run one of my restaurants is  so great how they work together as a team  completely oblivious to his wife s heart breaking because he can t see the irony in his admiration for someone else s relationship  truly  he gets off on watching other happy couple generate more money for him  while brushing his wife and their marriage to the side   long story short  he fucks over the brothers  basically forces them out of their position as the true owners of mcdonald s by creating a new corporation and stealing the mcdonald s brand name  he forced the brothers the change the name of their restaurant  and then opened his own  mcdonald s  in san bernardino to compete with the brother s original restaurant  and puts them out of business   watching it got me thinking about how this corporatized  rat race  dick measuring contest mentally is now at 100000x what it was 70 years ago  the hard of small business owners  like the brothers  is getting stamped out by vicious power-hungry  greedy fucks like ray kroc who exploit the hardest workers who are just following their dreams and trying to do something meaningful with their lives  i m just thinking about how work itself isn t the problem  long hours and blood sweat and tears isn t the problem  the brothers had something that they d built with their own hands  and they were very happy to have what they did  the problem is that there are just enough greedy rich bastards like ray kroc who all love themselves and their money so much that they re willing to crush other people without so much as a moment of hesitation  and all for what  money  power  influence  what s the point  also worth noting that this motherfucker hoard his massive wealth of billions until his sorry ass kicked the bucket  it wasn t until after he died that his new wife  for whom he divorced his first wife  after having a long affair  eventually became a philanthropist and donated everything to the salvation army and other charities  he was probably a controlling piece of shit and wouldn t let her touch his riches til he died   anyway sorry just rambling my thoughts  def recommend the movie even though it made me angry  it was well paced with very little filler content and the acting was good  the actual events in the movie are mostly fictitious but basically representative of the actual story  thanks for reading ,iut80v

305,Work gives me anxiety. Not working gives me anxiety + existential depression,i'm 25 and slogged for 6 months at an ib  my boss told me right at the start that even if i went for a movie on the weekends i had to tell him so he could make alternate arrangements in case some urgent work came up   i toiled like this day in  day out for 6 months before i burnt out  quit  and moved back to my parents'  i thought of taking some time off before taking my next move  then covid hit and quarantine has meant i've been stuck at home without being to go out  meet friends  etc   i got sucked into frivolous social media debates and arguments and triggered my ocd again  i spent the last few months in complete agony with multiple hours in a day spent having imaginary arguments in my head   a psychiatrist advised me to take meds but have avoided it so far  i felt i needed the distraction of work to get my mind to avoid thinking again  so i have taken up another job recently   it's been a double whammy  i hated work  but my anxiety issues are so bad that i cannot be left free to think  i'm having to take a job purely to numb my brain   the one thing i've decided is to not have kids  don't want to pass on my genes for anxiety to anyone    i'm not able to find a purpose in life or connect with society either  everything seems so polarized and filled with irreconcilable differences between various groups who can barely agree on a shared view of reality  our innate penchant for tribalism is rearing its ugly head at a time of potential existential threats like climate change  is there any hope    are we naive to even think about hope   as for me  i'm just hoping to use my work as a crutch to numb my brain and earn enough for me to survive until my inevitable death ,ix18d1

316,Gaslighting and mainstream ideology on Reddit and the Internet,the people on this site often reproduce a lot of toxic ideology and guilt-trip others in order to adapt them into the capitalist system  i've been lurking and subbed to many mental health subs  motivation subs  self-development  etc  and basically all of them work with the status quo as a given  have autism or adhd  well we're not going to talk about how this excludes you from a lot of working environments  you just need to be medicated and function like the rest of us  don't have any motivation to work  you're depressed and by such obviously wrong  don't have skills  were raised in a toxic environment  who cares    it's all about this far-fetched individualistic  willpower   discipline   motivation  discourse  they gaslight you  saying they want to  improve  but in the end you're only improving because you need to  fit in  and not because you want to  it would be nonsensical to improve for the sake of it  just like growing for the sake of it is what got us in the climate change mess  in the end all your problems are your responsibility alone and if you are not succeeding it's because of you  i hate it so much  it destroys our self-image  when we fail at commiting to tasks  following a schedule  it all comes biting back at us  with work and capitalism  this is overwhelming  as failing to  get into a job  proves fatal or pretty dangerous  many having to return to the same toxic environments they swore they would never go back to  others having to reduce their living conditions by a lot  it's ideology at its finest  and we are playing right into our own demise  once the atomistic idea of the world sticks  you automatically exclude those not deemed  fit enough  to wage slave 8 hours or more per day  and this exclusion is total  you are left to live on welfare if you're lucky  or to rot away  or depend on close ones    we often hear of the  success  stories  youtube  reddit  facebook are filled with them  people who are very skilled at what they do  like their jobs  have their lives  in order  earn loads of money  etc  however  these kinds of  goals  are unatianable for the majority  most are destroying their mental health further by trying to meet expectations or just to fit in a broken system  and it pains me a lot  both in my personal life and when i think about others  and i'm sick and tired about it becoming mainstream and shaping up a whole generation to become either mentally distressed empaths  neets  hate-infused incels or narcissistic liberals or conservatives who buy into the discourse in its entirety  we've lost so many things  social media is partly to blame for sure  but in only benefits the system in the end  the future looks grim and this generation is geared up to make huge mistakes ,ivtx9q

347,The main thing stopping me from quitting my job is not wanting to inconvenience my coworkers,i ll preface this by saying i m a teenager and i work in an assisted living home  i don t want to stop working anytime very soon because i need the money  but i ve been considering switching to a job that has better benefits  and a better manager   so i ve heard loads of people talk about how it feels so good to quit their job because of how bad the conditions were at their workplace  it s great that they did that  but there s always that voice in the back of my head saying  but now their coworkers are in just as bad of a situation as they were  except worse because now they re understaffed  i especially feel that this is true for companies that actually need to run  such as assisted living homes that help people live  and i can t help but feel like quitting those places is only making the world worse   is there anything wrong with this mentality  and if so  how can i shed it so that i don t feel bad when i eventually quit ,iwx95u

358,The fallacy of personal congruence,there are so many well-intentioned healers  mentors  educators  and therapists who endlessly encourage personal congruence  or the idea that one s values  beliefs  thoughts  and actions are in alignment  i have one question  how the   is anybody able to be congruent in this world  we were designed to have our needs met in community and by nature  and instead we are either forced to spend our waking lives working to enrich others or are so corrupted by obscene wealth we become oppressors  i appreciate the idea of congruence because it helps me own my pain and see this disgusting dynamic in stark reality  and i am done with a mental health industrial complex that profits off of telling people their lack of congruence is their doing  and it is within their power to change  sadness  depression  and acting unkindly toward others is unfortunately natural in an abusive world  i wish these misguided people would expand their lens beyond the symptoms and join in the hard work being done to change the system s foundations ,iwv6fr

364,My coworker and I are about to get fired because of one missing pill.,i work as a med aide at an assisted living facility  it's been especially understaffed lately and a few days ago  while being rushed for time  i unintentionally dropped a bottle of suboxone  the pills spilled everywhere  i frantically picked them all up  or so i thought  i even counted them twice and came out to the correct number  but apparently i still miscounted by one  by the time the next med aide arrived  i still hadn't realized this  and so i told her she didn't need to count this med as i had just done it  she took my word for it and that was that   the following morning  i woke up to missed calls from my manager and that coworker  telling me that one pill is missing out of the bottle  and since that coworker  counted out  with me  they put her at fault  i even explained to them everything that had happened  that i dropped the bottle of pills and miscounted without realizing  and then told her to not count out  but now we are both  under investigation  and can't return to work until further notice    we're supposed to get paid today  and it usually hits my bank account at midnight but its now 3 30am and still nothing  i mean i'm sure they'll pay me  it would be illegal to withhold it  right  i'm probably just paranoid  i don't even care at this point if they decide to fire me or not  but my coworker's health insurance is tied to her job and she really needs that right now  she's genuinely a wonderful person who's been a med aide for 10 years and has never made a med error  all it took was a careless med aide to fuck that all up  she doesn't blame me at all  and has been incredibly sweet  but i still feel terrible    we're working under two new nurses that have just started this month  they both have  never dealt with anything like this before  so they don't know what to do  last year  i made my first and only other med error and my manager then was completely forgiving  another med aide made three significant med errors in one week  and another lost a full card of oxycodone  and they're both still working here  these things happen  i just can't believe the two of us are now likely going to get fired over one pill    sorry for the rant  i was feeling alright until i checked my bank account balance and realized that they might actually not pay me  lol ,iwxv12

394,This is all so wrong...,it's all fucking wrong  8 hours a day  locked  inside a cubicle  isolated from your family and friends  without the right to do anything you enjoy  only working to survive and not starve to death  plus commuting  and then you have a few hours left but it's night and you're too tired to do anything other than sit down and watch tv  and you also have to eat and do hygiene stuff as well  and your friends are too busy working and taking care of their kids to hang out with you  so you end up alone in your dark living room watching tv or using social media  only a week or two vacation when it's summer  and if you work in retail   or for some big corporations  you get minimum wage    and if you're one of the very unlucky ones  congrats  you are now working in a sweatshop 10 - 12 hours a day  with bad conditions  from age 8  without workers rights  personal freedom  breaks  or even being allowed to go to the bathroom  you get paid not even minimum wage at this point  you get like what  50 cents a month  you waste your life and slave your days away just so that you can keep breathing  you spend all these years and years every day  doing the same thing locked inside a building  away from all those people and things you love  not allowed to leave  or else you starve to death  and you literally have to pay with not only your money but also your time go breath  you have to pay to survive  and i say survive  because surviving and living are two different things   there are fucking 7yearolds working in mines in india  13 hours a day  and the best worst case scenario for them is that they will get some terrible chronic condition that will follow them for the rest of their miserable  lifeless life and kill them at age 40  or even younger  and the worst scenario i can think of is them dying inside the mines of asphyxia or getting lost in them and no one ever finding them  they waste their childhoods  the most holy thing they will ever have  and work away their youthful  innocent  worry-less years  only to make a bunch of fucktards richer  a bunch of fucktards that pretend to care about the world and do charity but in reality they are the ones who cause so many problems in the first place  these children walk around in broken  ripped apart slippers that no longer fit them and their feet hurt and then these fucktards live in lavish mansions with pools  private yatches  10 bedrooms  and a bunch of other things that they don't need   there are 7yearolds being kidnapped and forced to work in chocolate plantations  yet those 7yearolds will never taste chocolate themselves  these 7yearolds will never have a childhood  these 7yearolds will never know what it feels to get dirty in the mud with your friends after a good rain and looking at the rainbow fascinated together and calling all your siblings and your parents to see if as well  they know what it feels like to be dirty from the labor  dirty from the unbathedness  but they don't know what it feels like to play in the sand right next to the beach with your cousins while doing cartwheels and playing tag  they will never know what waking up late in a sunny saturday morning and going straight to the streets to meet your friends and ride your bicycles  run  and play together till the sun goes down feels like  they will never know what your parents buying you a new doll for christmas or your birthday feels like  their parents can barely afford existing and raising them  they probably have barely played  barely chased each other  barely run  barely had fun  barely stared at  rainbows fascinated in their small  short existences  they will never know any of that   they ask me why i am antiwork  well  this is why  i want a world where you don't have to pay to exist  neither with your time nor with your money  this system is broken  broken to the core  and cancer like that is normalized and romanticized by westerners who haven't even lived a day like that   omg 11  shout-out to the parents who work like that so that their kids can live 11  or  uplifting news  80 year old woman finds job at a warehouse    no  you middle class ignorant piece of shit  this is nothing romantic  this is nothing uplifting  this is not something to celebrate  this is not something to shed tears of joy looking at  we should shed tears of terror  this shit is terrifying  it's terrible  and if says a lot of things about our world   we have so many things to afford  housing  electricity  water  internet  technology  food  taxes  i could go on  yet the greatest price we will ever pay for any of the above  is not money  is not cash  is not pennies  but it's time   end of rant ,iw7xql
395,3 weeks in...,on the one hand  i get it   for some people work is just a paycheque and they don't care about anyone but themselves   however  indifference makes everyone else miserable and i still have to protect myself from people like that   so  my mentor is introducing me 1 by 1 to the team     he gets to one guy and after introducing me to him  we walk a short distance away and he says  this guy is not a friend  here's just here to get his paycheque and go home   this doesn't translate to this guy is indifferent    this translates to this guy will screw you over for his own gain if he can get away with it   anyway  it's tech support    i'm handing out the issues   a few weeks later  the guy reaches out saying  yo  a ticket you assigned didn't have  insert some trivial technicality like an unchecked checkbox that he could have handled  and then proceeds to assign it back to me saying to correct it   one the one hand  nobody told me to do it that way   on the other  even i didn't have that excuse  did you have wait 2 weeks  let the customer suffer  and then throw me under the bus for it  and screw up my statistics   i get it  he's got his past    he's been there a while   he's got his boundries so he doesn't get walked on     well  i guess the guy got what he wanted because now i'm not going to come to him for anything   i dunno   not saying i'm perfect but like ,iusgnb

398,Working with mental issues is awful. Extremely nervous about my future - how do I keep going?,i have had issues with depression  ocd and anxiety for a fairly long time but then add work stress to that on top of those not good  every day seems like a struggle    i know many other people have worse jobs but even the slightest things can affect you a lot when your mind's not working properly  a simple message or email from the boss or a client can make me feel terribly anxious  i was just thinking earlier today  living in constant panic is no way to live      so what are my options   - my dream job when i was younger was to work as a filmmaker but with my anxiety and depression that seems almost impossible   - i could continue working at my current job without any joy  but what's the point    - most people tell me to look for another job  but the job hunting process makes me so anxious it almost makes me cry  also  i'm too depressed to add skills and degrees to my cv right now    - i'm not even sure if my current job is the problem  working at any sort of place with depression and anxiety seems terrible   society values you according to the job you have  so i'm supposed to keep working  it's so deeply ingrained in our system that even i think i'd be worthless without a job    i'm extremely nervous about my future  i don't know what's a good option that i have  i can't even imagine working like this for the next few decades - just blindly hoping my mental health and general state of mind improves ,ix1nfg

408,question about &gt;40 hour work weeks in non-office settings,hi  all  i ve recently discovered this sub and have been scrolling through for probably two or three hours now taking it all in  i definitely relate to the work fatigue a lot of people here talk about  and dig the idea of a shorter work week    i work as a mechanic  and oftentimes work 9-10 hour shifts all week  as well as college on my days off  i do really love my field  and my job is incredible  but i find myself constantly tired of being there  and dealing with the mundane work things like customer interaction and paperwork    i was wondering  though  how a 20-30 hour work week would affect non-office jobs  i m fascinated by the idea of shorter work weeks  but i m just not understanding how it could apply to things like automotive or food service where places are open long hours  7 days a week  can anyone explain if how this could work ,ivkvjr

422,Just another rant about sacrificing your employees for your managerial mistakes / greed,quite a long rant  tl dr at the end   i work an office job for a big company  it's not atrocious but i clearly see a decline in the quality of the subjects i work on since last year   i got upset today when my  supervisor   he is not hierarchically above me but he basically controls the subjects i work on  told me that i would probably need to go alone on a business trip for 2 or 3 days next week in order to do something that's normally not my job   i already went to this location a few weeks ago because i was one of the most relevant people to handle the work there was to do  so even though i don't like business trips  because i'm not more compensated despite having to dedicate my personal time to the company for a few consecutive days  i was not fundamentally against it  but this time  it's to do something that i'm not supposed to do  and that i barely know how to do  the reason i should go   i was told  is because  we're short on resources   people  so  already knowing the answer  i naively asked  but why don't we tell the management that we need more people   the answer was  we constantly told them for the past 3 years  and obviously nothing changed for the past 3 years  so during all this time  the team had to do  and still has  with what they had in order to make the project succeed  or at least survive  i should say   and that's exactly what the problem is  people in this team counterbalance the lack of resources by working late  doing more work than they should  and doing work they're not supposed   qualified to do  not to mention the important amount of stress that they have to endure   so of course the management does nothing to help  even though we tell them that there is a  lack of resources  the work is done  and that's all that matters to them  i think that the only way we could actually get more resources is by endangering the project itself  simply by doing our work as we are supposed to do instead of overworking  but that's not the team's mentality apparently  my teammates want to do more even though it might burn them out   i always thought that this mentally was fucked up  so out of principle i try my best to never work too late or for too long  but this time  i feel like they might force me to do like them  even though i strongly informed my supervisor that i don't want to go and that i don't agree with the management policy  he didn't insist too much  but since the other people he asked refused to go too  i'm afraid he will come back to me and pressure me    i must confess that i am more and more fed up with this job that makes less sense to me every day  and i event recently considered to resign  i'm not quite sure yet if that would be such a good idea  but if my supervisor insists too much  i'll inform him that i'm considering quitting this job  if he forces me  i'll quit   i'm not against discovering new things  new places  or learning things that i don't know yet  but i don't want to be forced to do things i never asked and that i am not supposed to do  and sacrificing myself and my family for the sole reason that the company's management is utter bullshit    amp x200b   tl dr  my supervisor wants me to go on a business trip for a few days in order to do something that i am not supposed to do  that i don't want to do  and that i barely know how to do  because our management doesn't want to give us more resources and it's a habit of this team to overwork themselves ,iu3prq

441,Automation discussion,think about it this way  we perform labor to gain the buying power to get wants needs that result from the labor  but we invented machines that are capable of doing 70  of labor  and computer programs that make 100  of labor more productive  so if the machines can do the labor  why would we still need to do it   people will still work  but the difference is it will be a choice to work  rather than the only way to survive  we would need significantly less people performing labor for the same  if not greater productivity   there is no logical reason for a person to have to perform a role they don t want to do  if an automation is available to perform the role instead  this is a new luxury we have available to us that the planet has never had before  this alone is what makes antiwork possible ,itwd9w

447,COVID outbreak at my former workplace one week after my last day. They weren't allowing WFH.,context  i live outside of the us so bear that in mind as you're reading    i'm an attorney so even before covid  working from home would have been something i could do most days  unless i'm going to court or a meeting  i'm mostly sitting at a desk all day  so i never saw a need to be in office everyday from the jump  then the court started having zoom hearings and meetings  so there was even less of a reason to leave home  but i worked in a law firm with a bunch of old people who need to physically see you slaving away in order to feel like they're getting their money's worth out of you    even when our prime minister put out a law saying that anyone who can carry out their job function from home should work from home  they were still trying to force us to come in  i got in at 10 00 one morning and my supervisor  who had been working from home for months at that point and who was hardly ever in office even before covid  reprimanded me for being  late  and then made me do a bunch of things outside of my job function including delivering documents to court and to other attorneys' offices even though i asked if the documents could be sent electronically  no  she specifically wanted me to be going out and about during a pandemic while she was safely in her home  she said i hadn't  paid enough dues  in my career to be able to come in at 10 00  during a pandemic when the government says i don't even have to be here  period   that was the last straw for me and the next day i sent an email saying that i will be working from home until the government mandates otherwise  she was annoyed  but there wasn't much she could do  i returned to office when the government ended mandatory wfh and then quit  my notice period is 3 months so i was there until the end of august  cases had been steadily rising and they were still forcing staff to come in    one week after i left  i'm hearing that there are two confirmed cases and possibly more  the firm is trying to keep it quiet and they're still having people come in office lol  they're also being picky about whose covid test they're willing to pay for  i think i should be fine since i had stopped interacting with coworkers due to low morale and just not giving a fuck anymore  i kept my office door closed most days and always wore my mask if i was leaving the confines of my office space to interact with a coworker   my new job allows me to wfh  pays more and the work is more fulfilling  i transitioned from civil litigation to human rights  civil litigation literally brought me to the brink of my sanity  i refuse to give my time  energy and health to an employer who so blatantly doesn't give a fuck about me ,it4emg

498,"Anyone identifying with ""Cultural Nihilism?""",i read a bit about nihilism and figured i agree with the cultural aspect of nihilism  the others not so much    i believe that there will never be a right form of culture or social construct  because my experiences and studies show me once again that humans aren't meant to live in large social groups      all the stuff we're experiencing in the world is just basic and mostly primitive human behavior and most people don't even notice that what they are doing just leads to even more issues       i feel like every concept we strive for nowadays  equality  freedom  democracy - they are all just human concepts and none of them works in the way we pursue it      we as human beings forced our own perverted way of life and meaning into this world and feel like we have the god-given right to act like the pinnacle of evolution     we act like we are on our way to perfection  what we don't understand is that everything that doesn't fall under that perception of an ultimate goal becomes ugly and unwanted to us      we don't live in times of accepting  we live in times of seeking false meaning in mundane and distracting concepts of what we believe should be true   and we just believe  we don't know      we change things until they fit our own expectations  but don't realize that we have so different approaches to things that there will always be someone unhappy       the best we can do in my opinion is to stop organizing and gathering humans in large social constructs that will only lead to jealousy  anger and injustice      especially that culture of blind discipline and obedience that tells you if you're not good in a particular area  you just have to try harder ,ishc0y

512,"Why can’t the government make working optional, pay for the necessities (food + water) and we work for everything else?",sorry if what i m about to say is extremely ignorant  honestly don t know the economic reasons but surely there is a way they can do this  especially considering they fund other stuff unnecessary to basic survival  by necessities i mean at least food and water   maybe  also  very  basic shelter and basic health care    they could regulate the food and water intakes so that each individual family is given a certain amount of money that only covers basic food  each person is able to get all nutrients required  needed for each person  so like a family of 2 adults and 2 kids would get a slightly different amount than 2 adults  1 kid and 1 baby     i think the only reason we have to pay for things in the first place  except for people just wanting to get rich and have more than others  and have power control  which isn t a valid reason anyway  is so that there isn t a shortage of materials  well  plus the fact that people believe that if you do more work  you deserve to get more in return  which i will talk on that later  but  basic  food and water should be for everyone regardless of anything    but back to the first point  there shouldn t be a shortage of materials because many people are eating way too much than they need  so that should even it out a little of the overeaters get less and the undereaters get more  and if there did happen to be a shortage of food on the horizon  they would be stupid not to stop it before it happened  because they would be able to tell how much they are capable of producing vs demand  they can instead regulate the amount of children we are allowed to have   which i know doesn t sound nice  but it is important to take care of the people already on the earth first  if we can t take care of everyone here  in the sense that  there isn t enough resources  then producing more people is only going to worsen that  plus we all know that overpopulation is a big issue for many reasons  any for those that do really want children and this were to happen  there are lots of kids that need to be adopted    i know it might not be that simple  but neither is what is happening now  it s anything but  but surely this is a better way    so why can t the government pay for our food  and we pay for everything else  and make working optional     for those of us who want to live extremely simple work free lives  well away from capitalism  then we would be free and happy to do so     for those of us who want to work and buy tons of materialistic things  then we would be free and happy to do so     for those of us who want something in between  or only part time work  then we would be free and happy to do so     so why can t they make it happen     or rather  is it that they can  but they just won t  because it benefits  them  personally  as the money is in their pockets  but surely  if we all stood for this idea  then the power of the people would overturn the power of those few ,iukrwz

576,Corporate scum (rant),i'm a full time salary employee of a major liquor retailer in australia    around 12 months ago the corporate giant that owns my company got caught in a massive employee underpayment scandal  to the tune of  500 million and counting  turned out they weren't paying government mandated allowances and penalties    as a result they tucked their tails and said 'we'll pay it all back plus interest  but give us time to investigate'   so then corona hit and we were all scrambling  as i'm sure a lot of you were whats the story  do i come in on monday  the premier just said there's a fucking a curfew  so liquor is an essential service now  ok fuck you i guess i'm coming in    as a thank you for working during a pandemic they gave non-salary staff stock options and a  250 gift card  salary staff at a sister company owned by the same corporation got a  1000 bonus in march or april    we got nothing     it's been as busy as christmas since march  what can people do in a lockdown but drink and beat their wives  sales are higher than ever but roster budget continues to get slashed    if a shop pays penalty rates due to ot they get a please explain from upstairs    and still no word on our back pay and not so much as a thank you for working during a pandemic  just a bunch of empty platitudes about family and teamwork and keep up the good work  great numbers today  atta boy    seriously since march  humans have become fucked  so entitled  so abusive to those that have to serve them  working retail the last six months has honestly  been horrific  i'm forced to get into altercations on a nearly daily basis  i cringe when i get called to the front becuase it's just as likely something basic or me having to get into another fight with some fucking cunt    it's really demoralising having to put yourself through that and know the company is underpaying you    no word on the underpayment investigation until about 6 weeks ago    we just finished working out the back pay situation and based on our calculations we owe you nothing   but wait    they are going to 'lock in' our performance bonus to 80  as a thank you for working in a pandemic  not even the whole fucking thing  when i know for a fact this was the most profitable 6 months in the companies history  what a slap in a face    but wait    we now want our salaried staff to cover saturdays and sundays so we can save about  200 on sunday pay per store  end result you are working a 4 week roster that results in you working 15 out of 17 days before a propper break  you don't need to spend time with your friends and family  we need you here on sunday    and    let's agree you don't necessarily need compensation for things like public holidays and overtime and meal allowances so we don't run into that pesky underpayment situation again    also    let's get all that on paper and bully you to sign it while unemployment is at an all time high so you have no where to go   yep they forced a contact change during a fucking pandemic    it was made clear to me that if i refused to sign hr would be involved right away and it would not be comfortable    what makes me most mad though is the conference calls  where these compassionless arseholes are broadcasting from their couch or kitchen or in the backyard having a beer and a bbq giving me all the 'we're all in this together' bullshit    we ain't in shit until you're here on a sunday handling some old cunts slobber covered cash motherfucker  seriously i've seen boomers take their mask off to lick their finger to pull the cash out to hand over  un fucking believable    side note  i fully recognise that a lot of you have way worse bosses  i'm just blowing off some steam   stay safe  eat the rich  peace out ,irf2a7

586,Is there an escape? (venting/seeking advice),this post might end up incoherent  but this is something that i've been thinking about a lot lately  i apologize in advance that i don't really know how to articulate this  i don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this  i just need a place to vent and maybe feel like i'm not insane    amp x200b   i  24f  currently work in a very emotionally and mentally demanding live-in direct care job in the social services field  in the united states  i've worked there for nearly two years now  what i am is essentially a single houseparent in a group home for teenagers that have been removed from the home     amp x200b   nearly every day recently i find myself mentally distraught thinking about my job and about work in general  i think about how i'm severely underpaid and under-appreciated for the amount of time  effort  and energy i pour into my job  i love the kids that i work with  and some of my coworkers  but the long hours are very rough  the work itself can really take a toll on me emotionally  and i am rarely recognized for doing well  i actually often feel like i'm not doing well at all  especially in the more recent weeks i've felt guilty for being so pushy about getting my breaks because we're so short-staffed  but other than the weekends  my breaks are the only time that i feel like i can truly be myself  i find myself comparing myself to friends and family members that make significantly more money than i do for jobs that don't demand nearly as much of them  i think about how simply by existing i'm being forced to participate in this society that is completely ruled by money  and that i'll never escape the need to make money to survive and pay my bills and loans  the only careers i'm qualified for are in a field that demands so much of me  drains me  and has led me to experiencing what i assume is burnout  i find myself feeling trapped  and like i'm being erased by my job  like i'm not a person outside of my job title until saturday and sunday  i've been wondering if maybe social services isn't for me  but whenever i explore and research different fields  i come up against questions like   would this be fulfilling for me  and  would doing this compromise my beliefs  and  how can i afford to go back to school when i'm already so deeply in student loan debt  and i wish that i didn't care so much about how much money i'm making  one of my main goals in life though is to live somewhere rural in a cottage cabin  and i know that i need money to get to that point  literally  everything is behind a paywall  and even when i get there  i'll need to keep working regardless to pay the aforementioned bills and loans and keep myself alive  so i just feel stuck  knowing that while i'd really prefer not to work at all  or only do work that i enjoy when i choose to  i still have to keep working no matter what  i don't know  maybe i'm just extremely burnt out from my current job  and that's what's going on with me  any time i think too hard about it  i just  start crying  and i can never really explain what i'm feeling and what i'm going through  i feel like there really is no escape from work  from my life being ruled by work and by money for the rest of my life  other than inevitable death  to me  the requirement to work is pretty much the worst part about being alive     amp x200b   also  being this upset so often makes me feel ungrateful  because these distressed thoughts are always drowning out everything else  what i should be thinking about more often is what i am grateful for  a place to live  a happy and healthy relationship with a loving partner  my family being alive and healthy  financial semi-stability at the moment  etc  etc  there is so much more to life than a job  and work  and earning money  and owning things  and i recognize that and believe that  but i still just  i feel like i can't break free from my mind sometimes    amp x200b   all of that being said  does anyone else understand this feeling  how do you cope with this  how do you alleviate this kind of pain    amp x200b   is there a way to ever truly escape the hellscape work-driven society that we live in  especially with bills and loans hanging over your head     amp x200b   i apologize for such a long post  but i just needed to get this off of my chest  and i need to feel like i'm not going crazy feeling this way ,iqaw7f
587,The Covid waiver. Sign it or don't?,i'm unemployed  hooray for now  but i'm hearing about a lot of workplaces making employees sign a covid waiver when they return to the workplace  it's basically signing away your rights to sue them if you contract the virus at work  ah  i'm not surprised    i'm not a lawyer and i've never spoken to a lawyer about it  but i would never sign such a thing  we already give up valued time with our loved ones and ourselves  lose sleep  put up with abuse  etc  so why would we sign away our right to sue if we end up in the hospital  or even our families suing if we die  no thanks  i'd rip it up in their face ,ir7kk9

614,Singing job application on LinkedIn,just saw a post on linkedin in my native language  where someone does a singing job application  to the tune of bohemian rhapsody   naturally it's very cringy and awkward   however  all the comments were extremely positive  and stating ridiculous things such as  ''all job applicants should apply like this ''  wow   insert name here  you will surely find a job soon now ''  the young woman making this video was also featured on the local news  she said how difficult it was to find a job and that there were 120 applicants to the last job she applied to  ultimately the segment came of more depressing than uplifting to me   nobody literally nobody mentioned either in the comments or in the news segment how fucking degrading it is to have to send in a fucking singing job application just to beg for a fucking job    jesus christ  kill me already ,irjtmz

622,I hate being part of a machine that makes other people miserable,hey guys  i work as a debt collector in a call centre that services a major european bank that operates in my developing country and i really hate having to work for a bank  i know first hand they do a lot of things  wrong  to keep its costumers in debt and even during this whole pandemic all they do is push for more and more profit while their costumers struggle financially    i want to tell you guys  the financial sector is probably one of the worst features of capitalism and having even just minimum knowledge of what happens from the inside can destroy your self esteem  and since a lot of the working class seems to support this system and shit over their fellow people  if ww3 happens someday during my lifetime i'll drink and celebrate as banks get purified with fire  that's my dream,iqj2qj

627,One of the easiest ways to break free of the 9-5 hellhole, how do you make a centuries-old system like capitalism work   for   you    you find the skills it can't function without so you can grab it by the balls   i work as a freelance sales copywriter  i find myself recommending this route to so many people sick of the corporate world i figured i might as well put it into a post  maybe it'll help someone here   this is for anyone who doesn't mind escaping the 9-5 lifestyle by taking advantage of and profiting off the system  and even if you're not - being aware of this kind of fuckery will dramatically enhance your quality of life  trust me   at the moment  i make  3 500 a month as a retainer writing sales copy and emails for a single company  most days i only have 1-2 short emails to write  which is usually no more than 2 hours of work   if i need to take a few days off - which i do frequently since i'm dealing with some severe health issues - my employer is more than happy to let me do it because of how much money my writing is making him   plus even if there's a recession going on  like right now  i never have to worry about finding work  even if my employer goes out of business  in fact  what i do is so integral to the sales process that whatever businesses are surviving in a bad economy will need someone like me more than ever   the reason for all this is because the kind of sales copywriting i do is based on a very specific  scientifically-proven form of marketing that targets  specific psychological and emotional triggers in people to drive them to take immediate action    and it's not just non-profits and companies using this  the basic psychological principles this style of marketing is based on have been widely used by people in positions of power all over the world for  as long as humans have been able to communicate   only in the last 100 years have companies started using it for monetary gain   it's called  direct response marketing  and without this crucial step to the sales process  all business have a near-zero chance of making money due to the very nature of consumerism   politics  is pretty much nothing but direct response marketing  appeal to your  voter base's pain points  blame it on someone else  explain how they're  holding you back from your dreams   amp  ask for money to fix it  i've  used the same sequence to write emails and sales letters for health  supplements and hi-tech garden hoses more times than i can count   this is why companies like amazon and apple and google are bending over backwards to steal everyone's private data through their products and  services  the secret  most private thoughts of your target customers is  the kind of information that can easily be spun into  billions and billions of dollars  even with a barebones advertising campaign   because of that fact  companies will pay you substantially more for your time  so much so that you'll eventually learn to stop charging based on time and start charging based on how much money your client estimates to make from your work   that makes it insanely easy to hit a 6 figure income once you know how to market yourself  even if you're just a so-so copywriter  your skill is in so much demand it simply doesn't matter   so if you're looking for a way out of the 9-5 hellhole or just need a way to make more money  this is probably one of the most efficient ways    by learning the skill that functions as the lynchpin to the capitalist-consumerist sales cycle   best thing is anyone can do this and no one cares about your resume  only your ability to bring them results  i had only 5 months of part-time experience working for clients  all remote  before i was fired from my last actual job  i decided to try freelancing as a sales copywriter full time  it was a little bumpy at first but i'm now stable enough that i don't have to look for work unless i want to make extra money  i'm even learning how to charge companies high-ticket prices for my services  like  5 000 for a sales letter   and even if you're not on board with taking advantage of this terrible system  hopefully this serves as an example of how much money your opinions and interests are worth to people in positions of power  politicians and corporations use this in their every breath    we as humans are incredibly susceptible to it and they don't want you to know it ,ipvibs

659,What is work? — A few thoughts on what it means to be anti-work, according to samuel p  huntington  are  stable  valued  recurring patterns of behavior  further  institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community  moreover  institutions are identified with a social purpose  transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior   similar to how the state forces us to be citizens  pay taxes  accept its rule and its monopoly on legitimate violence   work  forces us to be  workers   sure  you can make all kinds of excuses for the state  it protects us   it's necessary   it creates order   how else would we deal with murderers  and so can you make excuses for work  nothing would get done without it   it's necessary   people need order in their life   how else would we deal with the lazy  but don't cling to these ideas and call yourself anti-work   as long as you value the  economic social relationship based upon compulsion  and as long as you can't even imagine any alternative to work as an institution  you're not anti-work  you just want work to be a little nicer     let's be pragmatic  keep it radical   now some of you probably want to point out how we can't just switch from having a work-riddled society to a completely work-free society overnight  and so  the reasoning often goes  it's silly to be  completely anti-work   i'ma be honest  i don't know what a future without work might look like  i don't need to know  nobody really does anyway  i also don't know how a future free of  war and slavery  might look like  but i sure as hell oppose these things as well  you can be 'pragmatic' without making excuses for work  we don't need to water down our opposition to work just because work is considered normal and necessary in this society   if we want to  end work  then keeping our perspective radical  as in  going to the root or origin  fundamental  is about as pragmatic as it gets  liberals have sometimes advocated for nicer working conditions  leftists have occasionally even fought for it  but that only got us where we are today  a world full of work  more useless  destructive and alienating than ever before   so here's my suggestion  let's not re-invent work  let's get rid of it ,ipmwwb

662,Must I pay my HOI?,i own my aging home  it's 120 years old  at least  my hoi payment is  500  i'm pretty handy and can do small to moderate repairs  i work part-time and we are just barely getting by   but   500 each year  for the rest of my life seems like torture and more hours of my life spent on subscriptions  we all know money   freedom   my thoughts are this  if the house falls down from being old  then is too much fine print in the policy to even know if major damages would be covered    i just makes more sense to take the extra 500 i would save by canceling my hoi  then adding 100  and purchasing  600 worth of cord wood to heat my home in the winter using an efficient wood burner   cord wood is insurance that i don't freeze to death  is it not   the snowball effect would be a significantly lower gas bill as well   again  the alternative is that i pay my hoi and my full gas bill   maybe use the saving to purchase compost and start a food garden   i don't like giving strangers my money for things i can't physically see or touch or taste with my senses   perhaps i know that the septic might need to be pumped in the next 2 years  i could use the money i save by not paying my hoi  for   chuckles  actual home repairs   but if i tell my old man  he'd freak out and say  you have to have hoi   thoughts ,ipts4s

693,"If you let your kid train for their future job for 8 hours a day, you're mentally unstable",i have a friend who is like 15  and she is planning to join the circus when she grows up  which is awesome  at least she will do a job she will enjoy  unlike us wage slaves or artists who never want to go pro full time who are stuck in a system rigged against them    what disturbs me though is that her parents actually let her practice 8 hours a day  every single day  it might even also be on weekends  she does online school early in the morning  and then for 8 hours straight just practices  in the same way a cubicle worker just works for 8 hours straight  and she also has homework so that leaves her with little to no time for herself or social activities   it distrubs me that this is considered fucking normal  i am very concerned for her  i do not think it is mentally healthy for a kid to spend so much time away from normal kid stuff like being with friends  silly high school stuff  watching movies  being in fandoms etc  i am really sad that such work life imbalance is normalized for some people from literal childhood  why do we think it is okay to do something from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to eat dinner  how is this ever okay  how is your whole damn life revolving around one single thing  whether it is your job or your passion normalized  we are more than just our jobs  sure  lets say that a man named joe is a worker  but he is not just a worker  he has other roles to fulfill in his life  he is not just ''joe  the worker''  he is joe the worker  the father  the husband  the friend  and perhaps even joe the painter or joe the celloist  and my friends usernames in all the social media accounts she has are something along the lines of ''circusgirl15'' which disturbs me even more  i know i am not the right person to discuss this cause i am practically an internet addict  and have suicidal thoughts every single day  but what i hate more than people who work sitty soul draining office jobs that they are aware are not mentally healthy nor good for their work life balance and suffer in them  is people who think being forced to do one single ting they  love by their employer for 8 hours straight every day or starving to death is an okay  normal thing and are completely fine with it    i see this as a defilation of art  art is supposed to be beautiful  charming  dreamy  exciting  fulfilling  not an addiction  not a thing that you are forced to have your whole life revolved around or you starve to death  it is fucked up  she is a kid  she is supposed to be doing normal kid stuff while simutaneously enjoying her art and cultivating her talents  not just having her whole life revolve around her future job  even if it is a job she enjoys  this is not okay  she is more than just an acrobat  she is a person with a personality  probably has friends  has family  and will possibly find a spouse and may have children in the future  se has many roles to fulfill in life  not just her future job  what on earth are her parents thinking  are they stage parents or something    which brings me to the next topic i want to discuss  which is people who have no identity outside their jobs  people who are just ''joe the warehouse worker'' or just ''joe the builder''  or that is what they think they are  not what they really  are  people who only discuss their jobs  their projects related to their jobs  people who can only talk about jobs    personally  i think if you spend more time working at mcdonalds  working in a cubicle  working at an office  or even at a fucking circus than you spend with your friends and family  then there is somethin seriously wrong with your life and you need to fix it  and anyone who normalized tha during your childhood was clearly mentally unstable and an irresponnsible parent  we are more than just our jobs  even the jobs we love  there is more to life than just work  or just art  there are relationships  experiences  trials  challenges  dreams  goals  travelling  learning  loving  celebrating  so many other things other than just working your days  whether your job is an amazon employee or a fire eater for cirque du soleil  life is complex  full of different activities  people  relationships and experiences  especially childhood  and it should not worked away    as niechze said  any man that does not have 2 3 of his day to himself is a slave whether he is a worker  a statesman or a buisnessman   if your whole life and identity revolves around your job  or even your future job as a chil worst case scenario  then something is wrong with it  doesn't matter if its a mind sucking shit office job  or an exciting form of art  life is more than just that and it is to be lived  you have only one life  no one on their deat bed wishes they spennd less time with friends and family to train for their future job    my two cents  no i have to go to sleep  this makes me even more suicidal than i already was  and it also makes me feel guilty for some reason for not wanting to make my passions  the loves of my life about money  no  i don't want to type my daydreams for 8 hours a day  i am not a fucking robot  i am a human  i am more than just ayano the writer  alright  i am ayano the writer  ayano the friend  ayano the sister  ayano the grand-daughter  ayano the believer  ayano the thnker  ayano the traveler  ayano the activist  ayano the lover of movement  ayano the poet  ayano the simple girl that sometimes just needs alone time for herself to

698,"24m, finding a career that doesnt make me depressed.",i'm not sure if posts like this are allowed here  but this sub seems filled with people who have faced the same struggles  so it seemed like a good place to post this   hello  i'm writing this because i'm just lost  i've never really been a career oriented person  i've always been more concerned about how i spend my free time as opposed to what i do for a career  i went to college for programming and eventually dropped out because i couldn't handle it   i've worked i handful of different jobs  at truss plant  a warehouse  have 7 years total experience at a fast food resturaunt in my hometown  worked there since highschool  i currently work at a factory that makes various plastic things  there isnt a job ive worked that didnt feel like a plauge on my existence  all i think about at home is how my next shift is coming  all i feel at work is this really depressing bleh feeling that i'm not really sure how much longer i can handle   however  its really hard to picture myself in a career that doesn't have me feeling like this constantly  your typical trade job strikes me as something i'd hate doing even more than what im doing now  and its hard to justify going back to school for something unless i'm incredibly enthusiastic about it   i'm lost and i can't keep up like this  i recognize the problem is probably with me and my own attitudes but i'm clueless how to escape them  and i'm extra lost at the idea of how to find an even remotely tolerable career  they always say look at your hobbies to find a career  but i don't do much outside of your typical hanging out with friends  watching tv  reading  playing games  etc  nothing really in terms of practical productive interests tbh  i feel like my only real option is do some generic buisness course and go work at an office somewhere  i'd probably make a little bit more money and i doubt it'll make me feel worse than my current job makes me feel  i still have bills to pay after all   what do you guys think i should do  i think at the end of the day my only goal here is to find a job that isn't str8 up emotionally painful to get myself into everyday  something i'm at the very least  so numb and indifferent towards it doesnt plauge my mind during my time ,iox02i

723,"So burnt out from years of non-stop work, idk what to do.", long rant    so i m fairly young at 25  i know i haven t put in years of hard labor and feel guilty for complaining but i m still exhausted    my mother was the type to constantly demand more of me  better grades  more chores  more after school activities  always thinking about the next thing to achieve  i started working as soon as i turned 16  i would work doubles every weekend  and after school when i didn t have practice for the 4 different sports i played throughout the year to  look good on my college applications    then i went to college  i immediately fell extremely ill and was sick for literally a year straight  did i have a break  no  i still continued school online with a full course load while working 40 hours at one job and part time at another  once better  i continued with full time school for 4 more years while i worked during every waking moment of free time    i swear i even remember the day i just cracked  i was in my second year of an incredibly degrading service job and i feel like my mind just completely numbed out by the stress and pressure    after graduating  i worked part time at an office job that i fucking  hated  they were so fucking stupid outdated and ended up firing me bc i suggested using emojis in a marketing email subject line to get people s attention  they said it was unprofessional  ok then  at the same time i worked at ulta which was also a hell hole  i was forced to con people into signing up for a credit card to not get my hours cut  and in return i d get these shitty free samples of like a pea size amount of products nobody wanted    then in may of 2019 i finally got what i felt like was the closest i could reasonably get to a dream job  i worked with a bunch of other young people in a gorgeous office with lots of amenities  dogs  and  unlimited  time off  then  everything changed when we were bought by a huge corporation  back in jan i could tell things were changing and at this point it s hell  i still feel  incredibly  bad for complaining bc at the end of the day it s still cushy and i make decent money  however  my boss is now cracking down on our time off   i got in trouble for taking time off when my dad had cancer and had to beg for 2 mental health days off this month despite not taking any time off since may    plus we re doing insane revenue pushes and are being told that it s going to get even worse for the last few months of the year and to not expect time off for holidays  i have worked on accounts that have made a whopping  40 million total in the last 3 months alone  along with another account that just got like  3 mil out of nowhere  but my team is the only one who hasn t gotten any raises  we re told we can t get bonuses or anything either    the light at the end of the tunnel is that i m being considered for a promotion next year  which at first sounded awesome  but the more i think about it i can t breathe  i don t want a fuck ton more responsibilities for a measly pay increase when i work on stuff that earns god knows who literally millions of dollars    i m just at a loss  i live for friday nights and saturday mornings bc sat night and all day sunday i m just dreading the week  i try so hard to  recharge  but nothing works  games  tv  cooking  nothing i love brings me pleasure anymore  i just refuse to live like this  if this is going to be my life i d rather kill myself    i have devised a plan to escape in  8 months and work for myself  but i feel discouraged about whether or not it ll work  if anyone is interested i m happy to go into it  but yeah idk  i just feel dead inside and it seems pathetic bc i know there s people working in sweatshops but even that doesn t make me feel  like  more grateful for helping rich people get richer you know ,intm4i

727,"Unemployed for the last 3 months, no desire to go back to work",about three months ago i quit my job  there was a few reasons i cited in my resignation letter  but to be honest it was mostly due to stress  this job was technically my  dream job   when i was younger  the moment i left one job i always had this drive to get my next job as soon as possible  this time  i feel nothing like that  i'm content to just be unemployed forever  i've sent some resumes  but only a handful  like 10  and only for positions i actually want  even though they're  good jobs  i dread the idea of being hired again   i've struggled through burnout before  so i know this isn't it  when i was burnt out  i remember feeling something along the lines of  don't wanna  which i overcame with the typical  fight through it  remember that you'll die of starvation if you don't work  this is a new feeling  its not that i don't want to  its that the very fabric of my being simply refuses to go back to a life of working just to survive  it's not a malleable feeling like  don't wanna  its set in stone  i wont   fortunately i still have five to six months worth of living expenses covered thanks to my savings  and i'm back in school  anyone else experiencing this next level of burnout  post-burnout burnout  i would be shocked to hear it's something you can get over  this doesn't feel temporary ,ip0jgq

729,I’m as close as I’ll every get to not working. Here’s how I did it.,1  went to school for a bachelor computer science   2  perfected my craft  focused on my favourite tech stack to the point where i m not constantly googling things  spent 3 years as a software developer for a big company while doing this   3  got a remote  part time  software developer ii job  it s 25hrs a week  45  an hour  i just open slack around 9am  fuck around or go back to sleep until 1pmish  work from 1pm to 2 30pmish  call it a day   i call it a reverse job  because living my life and hanging out relaxing is my primary occupation and i just work when most people take a lunch break   i deliver more than other similar devs so no one calls me out or has ever suspected anything   it pays enough for my wife and i to live a modest life  houses around me cost 100-250k  fredericton  new brunswick  canada  so if i want one the option is there   just my 2 cents if anyone is looking for a realistic way to get out of the 9-5  took me maybe 7 years total but now i just plan to coast in my pseudo retirement as long as i can ,inbj4m

731,Being a capitalist doesn’t make you the person to blame for wealth inequality and struggle of workers. The blame is on people who have a disposition of greed in regard to ownership.,it is how greed has been applied to the idea of ownership  that is to blame for our society not having the best opportunities for life for all people  i think when discussing the reason for inequality in society  capitalism and capitalists should not be stated as if they are the root of the problem  when the root of the problem is greed ,io82lh

733,"""Purpose in life""",this is an argument that my ethics teacher used to make frequently   that humans need work to find purpose in life  feel fulfillment and validation and be proud of something    and he's right - just not in the way he thought   we all have hobbies - whether it's sports  art  a craft  technology  etc   usually  tending to these hobbies is fun and making progress and improving is fulfilling  we like getting things done and getting better    but who in the hell has a job that actually serves this purpose a lot of people need to do a shitty job to survive  or work a job that pays better but they sacrifice almost all free time for  so it's mentally and especially time-wise even harder to actually do and enjoy your hobbies    i really don't understand people who don't know what to do outside school or work  with quarantine i've heard multiple people actually miss going to school work because they were  bored  how  are they so lifeless mentally and have no bigger hobbies and pleasures in life  have they never found worth in anything that isn't academically measured or similiar  sure  you couldn't really travel or spend time in the city much  but there is so much you can do at home    i honestly dread working a job that will use up most of my time and drain me so much  that i don't want to do anything proper outside of it  just wasting away my few hours of free time in front of the tv computer or something  the reality of many,io6mdr

767,So tired of school,this might not be absolutely appropriate for this sub as it's about school and not work  but i thought school is pretty much the first and most important part in a life of work and where they condition you to be a good worker   i am very tired of school - i think a lot of people already agree on this  but it's not an effective  supportive and long-term genuinely educating system  your time and individuality is not respected    you are thrown into a class of 20  people with a single teacher  you have to work at the speed of the teacher and majority of the class - no matter whether you need more or less time  you have only a few ways of gaining information - the teacher and whatever they dictate you to write down and your textbooks  which are barely used anymore because how goddamn outdated they are   you have just no control  if your school says you will now have a lesson of chemistry  you will have a lesson of chemistry  class is too slow and your time is being wasted  get used to it  class is too fast and you'd like to go back and understand from there on  do it at home and not in class  because you need to follow our rhythm   they don't want your genuine independence  creativity or other methods of learning  it's a goddamn pain   they even have the audacity to automatically associate great grades with talent  at least my teacher did  i mean  seriously  you are just going to shove this black and white world view onto students  you really believe good grades are a product of mere intelligence and talent   some of the people with the best grades were incredibly shallow  they had no important hobbies or talents  were not particularly good at anything and were some of the most boring and average folk  and they are willing to sacrifice you alive for some cookie points and better grades   school injects a mad amount of competition and rivalry into children young teens  competition alone is not bad  but making it all about perfect grades and disregarding skills outside of that  making many students feel hopeless for their future if they are not an absolute certain way    i still have a future ahead of me  but just the experience of school and seeing so many miserable adults with jobs they hate makes me incredibly pessimistic  i feel like you'd be most successful by going against the grain and doing something yourself and basically employing yourself  which is a failed dream of many and is a complete hit or miss  or hitting the super rare chance of working a good job with good conditions and a feeling of satisfaction  if these exist at all ,ipdyec
768,American work culture is fucking disgusting,only in the good ole usa do people actually take pride in working abnormally long hours  40-50-60  a week  for straight up starvation wages  with if lucky  a small handful of days off per year  oh but some even go as far as to take their pride further by not taking those days  people are getting fucking exploited and they'll say  welcome to the world   in that stupid fucking condescending tone  like no jenny you fucking absolute idiot this is not normal  you have a severe mental defect for believing it is  you're just as fucking miserable as everybody else so quit lying to yourself  not only all of that  but the fact that people identify with their careers makes me sick  why is the first question people ask you  what do you do  or  how is work  like for fuck sake is that all you serfs know how to talk about  my answer to that is its fucking terrible  thats what  i would rather be doing anything else  as would most of you if you werent so programmed by the hustle hard mentality  america is literally mindless drones who love to be miserable and if you go any other direction than the mold  they will feel nothing but the upmost content for you   fuck this fucking country and its stupid fuckin culture  free healthcare   but i worked for mine  free education   but i had to suffer and payback student loans  like honestly nobody gives a fuck  they can do it in europe  they work far less hours  enjoy far more leisure time  can actually afford to travel and are encouraged to take the time to do so  i don't think working would be nearly as bad if we followed suit to most of the first world european countries  but as we have already covered  the american rugged individualistic  work hard  mentality prevails  and as such we wont enjoy the higher qol citizens of these other countries can enjoy  tldr i hate it here and fuck you for bragging ans pretending you enjoy it or that you are somehow honorable for working like a dog ,incpw4

770,My situation.., living situation  i am fortunate enough to have parents who allow me to live at home  rent free  my job is actually bearable  even enjoyable at times  i deliver food for a laid-back family restaurant  i can be at home until i get a text that there is a delivery cooking  only then do i have to go to the store  after i complete the delivery i can simply go back home and wait for another order   only exception is during busy hours  i just wait in my car  so basically get paid to sit in my car  jam out  and be at home whenever they don't require my labor  on paper this is perfect  if i could just make my money this way it would be amazing  the downfall is none of this is taxed or verifiable income  it is all under the table  i make a lot of money thanks to this  easily enough to afford rent for a 1 br apt in my area  but i simply cannot get one because under the eyes of the gov and landlords  i am completely unemployed   i really want to find something somewhat chill that i can do part time that is on the books so i can get a place for myself  i have a home business venture that i spend the majority of my free time cultivating  and its very important to me to focus on that to eventually be my own boss   i've tried a few jobs so far  retail mainly  and they make me want to kill myself  no lie  a  real job  makes me so fucking depressed  i've worked jobs like this since i was a teenager and im getting really down and wondering if ill ever be able to find something else that's as bearable as this  does anyone have any suggestions of what i can look for  something i can do part time that has a low barrier of entry  as of now i've been looking for mainly call center desk jobs since that doesn't really bother me ,inbkdh
771,I’m as close as I’ll ever get to not working. Here’s how I did it.,1  went to school for a bachelor computer science   2  perfected my craft  focused on my favourite tech stack to the point where i m not constantly googling things  spent 3 years as a software developer for a big company while doing this   3  got a remote  part time  software developer ii job  it s 25hrs a week  45  an hour  i just open slack around 9am  fuck around or go back to sleep until 1pmish  work from 1pm to 2 30pmish  call it a day   i call it a reverse job  because living my life and hanging out relaxing is my primary occupation and i just work when most people take a lunch break   i deliver more than other similar devs so no one calls me out or has ever suspected anything   it pays enough for my wife and i to live a modest life  houses around me cost 100-250k  fredericton  new brunswick  canada  so if i want one the option is there   just my 2 cents if anyone is looking for a realistic way to get out of the 9-5  took me maybe 7 years total but now i just plan to coast in my pseudo retirement as long as i can ,inbjny

775,Home Healthcare: Caring about the people you serve when your bosses don't care about you.,warning  rant  if you don't work in this industry  this might come off a little intense  sorry  i'm just pissed   i work home healthcare  we cook  clean  take people on appointments  speak to families  speak to doctors  speak to nurses  we lift people  we use equipment  we give medication  including narcotics  and are expected to know the cause and location of every bruise on our clients bodies  when they die  we attend and arrange their funerals sometimes   our clients often cannot speak for themselves  the ones i've interacted with are kind  funny  and full of personality  there are other clients who sexually harass us or try to hurt us  but i personally view that as a failure of the system rather than them purposefully trying to make our lives harder  there are a few exceptions  lol  i care about every one of them greatly  even the ones who seemingly try to purposefully piss me off   i make 25 cents above minimum wage state  my managers make 5 and 10 dollars above minimum wage  respectively   and i feel evil for not doing my job perfectly because it's constantly held over our heads that we're neglecting them if we don't go above and beyond our duties  our company doesn't fucking pay us enough to care for ourselves  people call out all the time because they're so fucking exhausted from this job  i don't  because it's been drilled into my thick skull that i need to help the people we serve even if i'm hurting myself in the process   but it's not just me  it's the fucking system that thinks paying people like me and my coworkers to work 14 hour shifts doing this job  i love the individuals i work with  period  and i will not be guilt tripped into thinking relaxing when i can at the job when everything is done is fucking neglect ,ipm5vo

790,How do I confront my boss about micromanaging?,hi there  new to reddit  this is my first post  actually  since i  23f  graduated college last summer  i ve been working as a videographer editor at a relatively small tech company for over a year now  but my position title has never changed from  intern   even though i have never received proper training and was not brought on via the internship program   the funny thing about all of this is that i m the only video person the company has ever had  despite having been around for decades and having locations all over the world  so i ve had to teach myself numerous programs  skills  etc to make up for all their video needs  for the past year  i ve been told that they were in talks of hiring me as a full-time or permanent employee  but every time they said they d give me an answer they kept pushing it out and telling me things are really busy so it has to wait  my internship was supposed to only be 6 months long  but here we are   i m grateful to have a remote job right now  and for a long time i had a really supportive supervisor who advocated for me often  however  his position was cut at the beginning of the pandemic to save costs  my new supervisor cut my hours  i signed something that said i could work 20-40hrs a week and spent most of my first year working full-time  of course the document i signed regarding these specific hours or the email it was discussed in are nowhere to be found  and told me i m actually a part time  temporary employee when she had hr check the system  i had to rope hr in myself because she initially claimed i do not get benefits at all even though i have been receiving partial benefits as a part of my contract this whole time  she also told me that there will never be a full-time or permanent video position at the company  despite what my past supervisor and one of the executives i work closely with led me to believe   my new supervisor underestimates the amount of time projects will take and questions whether there is actually 20-25hrs of work for me almost every single week  she knows all the projects i m working on as they are listed on a sheet we both frequently update  i feel like she is suspicious of how i spend my time at work  which is especially frustrating because i ve been busier than ever since my previous supervisor was laid off  every day i feel like i have to prove that i m doing the most  which is negatively affecting my mental  i have anxiety and depression  don t we all  and physical health  i don t even take proper breaks for fear that my boss will think i m slacking off  thankfully my partner is able to bring me water and meals    i ve developed a trustworthy reputation for my work at the company  so i m just confused by all this  on top of that  my supervisor knows that i can barely support myself currently as it is  not that that changes anything  how should i word my concerns and frustrations to her  if at all  i m not sure of any way to do this without sounding rude or like an ungrateful  disgruntled employee  thank you for reading all of this  sorry if i sound naive ,ip2tti
791,"""Employee safety is our number one priority during this pandemic!.....Oh wait, our numbers are higher than we projected!? Fuck the employees!""",this is my company      when my state allowed non-essential manufacturing to start back up  my company was all about  safety   they still pretend they are  but it's bs     they  projected  sales to be way down   so in our manufacturing department  they said we only had to work four days a week   volunteer only   nobody had to come back mandatory until the late fall      but they didn't project that people were idiots in this country and would be ignoring the pandemic on a massive level and still buying and using our purely recreational item     all of a sudden   everyone  got called back mandatory   all of a sudden  four day a week was out the window   six days   mandatory   every week   sometimes seven day mandatory     no more lunch break   only a 15 minute in the first and last half purely for  safety  reasons   gotta limit people in the cafeteria  even though it's empty and everyone sits in their car   nothing to do with production and screwing us   just safety    entire factory is filled with posters saying   if you feel ill you are not allowed to enter the building   contact your supervisor and stay home     there must be one of those posters every 20 feet     guess what happens to people who are out of sick days and call out     written up   no actual change in the attendance policy     last thursday and friday i was vomiting and had diarrhea   that's obviously  feeling ill   both are also covid symptoms     written up for it   this has happened to many other employees since we've come back     we only get five sick days   i had influenza in january  all five of my sick days went out the window     the state guidelines tell employers to encourage their employees to stay home when sick   our company guidelines do the same according to these posters     but how the fuck do you write employees up when they actually stay home      this fucking system is a joke      i'm working 6 days one week  7 days the next   alternates back and forth weekly   been doing that since i came back to work in june     but two days out for actually being sick  doing what the company told me to do  and i'm written up    don't get me wrong  the money is good   so i can't leave   average income in my city is like 24k   i make 60k      but this corporate bullshit is insane      the thing that really gets me is 90  of the employees are pissed off   moral is in the toilet  but you bring up a union and most of them just freak out and spew anti-union propaganda they've heard somewhere ,iovbhe

796,My boomer coworkers are more fake than people I went to high school with.,i'm a white collar worker in my late 20s  to be honest i have learned to not let work things affect me  i don't stress  i don't put in a ton of energy  i just kind of do what i'm told and never strive to improve anything  as i see that as useless energy   i have been told that i need to be more assertive about my work  but i honestly feel like fuck that  it's not like i'm underperforming so they can suck it    i do get really frustrated about my coworkers though  a few of my coworkers are annoying peacocks  and i think they have an actual 'need' to tell everyone about 'how busy they are' daily  it's so cringy to listen to  anytime our boss is around  they start to talk in buzzwords all the time  it's legitametly patgetic to hear someone in their 50's or 60's lose all self respect and dignity trying so hard to impress a worthless manager half their age like that   today was annoying in particular because i was trying to work  and three people in the cubical next to me were talking about how  we need to continue driving in the left hand lane  meaning increase the amount of work we all do  so they are all jerking each other off with words talking about how much work they all do  then they start to talk about their actual commutes to work  then about how the roads need to be changed  looking up the roads on google maps   then talking about the cars they drive  then about podcasts  then about their kids' schools  and on and on and on for almost an hour    like wtf  i honestly do the bare minimum  and i do not care one bit if they or anyone does the minimum as well  but to make an outrageous try hard show about how much work they all do  all agree that we as a company need to do more so they can act like they care  then waste an hour doing nothing at all  loudly  is the most childish  pathetic  boomer behavior  i hate that i have to spend my life around people like this  and i want them all to retire asap so i don't have to deal with their bs  but don't even get me started about how long their daily  boring  repetitive conversations about their 401k and retirement is ,ip3dbg

798,I [20f] have no idea what to do - fucking hate this.,i'm 20-years-old  i was perpetually told by school that the only way to increase my prospects was to pursue university  is going to university even worth it when i'm not sure as to what i want to do  i read a statistic a few days back saying that 48  of graduates struggled to find work after graduating  that  and your degree is essentially worthless if it's obsolete not in demand    i've already wasted a gap year due to mental illness  suspected agoraphobia - oops  and am embarking on another  at this point i think it's just called 'life'  after having suffered a breakdown suicidal thoughts upon putting in a second application  because i'm stupid and felt pressured by society to re-apply  it's either university or full-time minimum wage work  apprenticeships are mostly offered to 16-18 year olds  i doubt i'll be allowed to pursue another course at the local college - 20 and living with parents  currently unemployed so i'm not paying rent  that fucking sucks - knowing you're a burden on your family   so far my prospects consist of  warehouse operative  retail  office admin work  cleaner - of which even then are challenging at times to get into  but then again i've heard plenty of stories of people going to uni  accumulating  50 000 worth of debt for a 3 4 year course and landing a bar tending job  that  and i've nothing i'm interested in enough to pursue for 3 4 years   i've no fucking idea what to do  someone help a fledgling out  please  or is it just a case of sucking it up ,ioki84

801,I’m tired of working as a NURSE rant,i had been working as an rn since i was 21  i graduated nursing school at around 20  to be completely honest  i had no choice of whatever profession i can take since it s either be medical or go to law or accountancy  and my asian parents were just pushing me to earn money fast even when i was barely an adult  honestly having asian parents suck  i wouldn t recommend it  such a toxic  you have to be better than mr  b s daughters  and  pride over stupid material things and status culture  probably one of the main reasons why i hated working in the first place    i moved alone and lived in brighton for a bit and met friends there and a lot of them folks my age  are just living their lives the way they want to   although some of them have illegal part time jobs  they were still happy and do not give any fcks about whatever people think of em   for a while though  it felt like i was hanging out with losers cause the more i spend time with them the more i realised these people have no direction in life  leeching off the system  pretending to be disabled and putting each other as their designated carers or whatever to get free housing and benefits   i hate working but i don t want to be a fcking parasite   i also lived in london and every single day when you take a commute in the morning  i swear you re in a train full of dead zombies  it made me so depressed  and the busyness of it all made me anxiety worse  hence why i moved again and moved back to the countryside   after moving for the nth time and not enjoying the nth hospital   company i applied to  not enjoying the toxic medical environment  not enjoying the commute  not feeling any satisfaction or any gratefulness of  helping people  isn t my job supposed to be rewarding   it is for a tiny bit then again is it worth giving all of me  my time to people who won t even remember my name the next day  families who won t even remember the nurse who did everything  run around  get the meds  inject the meds  to save their family member  they will remember dr  smith though   covid-19 happened and things got more shttier    no one has any idea how to handle things  everything that we ve doing at the hospital before were all apparently non effective and could not protect us from this disease    they change the policies every single day and i m not even sure if it s to protect us  the public or their pockets   beginning of last week  they told us not to use excessive ppe anymore because public health england says so  and using minimal ppe is enough   all of this nightmare  is getting to me  i ve been working so much over the last few months   i ve been working 50  hours and even weekends   last wednesday  my alarm didn t go off because my phone didn t charged and it was dead   i was so anxious and didn t know what to do  i live about an hour away from work and will be super late if i even attempt to go   i decided i would just lie and call off sick   i couldn t think of any excuse but say i have a fever and i told them that and then they all panicked cause i forgot it s a covid symptom and now i have to self isolate for 10 days  take a test and the whole shebang   i took a test  obviously it s negative  but my manager said i can come back to work if it s negative and i feel better    i received my test yesterday and i still haven t reported it to my manager yet cause i still don t want to go back    i probably would let them know later and come back to work tomorrow  it would be months and months of overtime and not being able to sit down again    i hate it though  i m glad i saw this thread  and know that i am not alone  i m waiting for a few more months  save some money and do part time  but it might not actually happen as soon as i want to cause my bf is at risk of losing his job   we need to pay the rent and we have two cats we need to feed  but i honestly cannot wait to quit work forever   fck capitalism    please ignore the world salad ,io3hve
802,31 minutes past the hour and no motivation to do anything,haven t lifted a finger since my shift started  just so tired of this daily grind i subject myself to  just to earn a living wage  only to have a couple precious hours at the end of the day to myself  half of which is usually spent wondering where  my  time goes and if what i do truly has any true value  certainly doesn t feel that way and probably doesn t in the grand scheme of things    there has to be more to life than this ,ipfzw9

805,Burnt out from an internship,a few months ago i started an internship at a huge company  i'm obtaining a masters degre and have a cummulative 1-2 years work experience  but all i could find were internships  the company is well-known to be a good employer    i wake up at 6am to get to work before 8am  and usually leave work around 6-7pm  arriving home around 8pm  sometimes later  i could leave earlier but i refuse to take unpaid work home with me unless working from home   i'm never thanked for my work  for which i earn slightly less than minimum wage  not including the 2hr daily commute  in fact  my coworkers all hate and constantly complain about eachother  pretty sure i heard one of them complaining to my boss that they have to help me with things  and that i'm not doing enough  lmao  since i only work with said coworker on one of the 100 things i need to do  and it's physically impossible to give 110  at 100 things   in the beginning it was great  i was still in training and hanging out with other interns all the time  but once training was done  i was expected to single-handedly maintain and expand code for a tool that's integral for our whole department  write important reports  that are reviewed by government agencies  organize the 1000s of physical and digital files we have  organize and oversee a project from conception to completion  and do the day-to-day  all at the same time  with little guidance   i'm only a few months in and seriously considering quitting  that nukes my chances at ever getting an actual job at said company  but if i don't put the internship on my resume i should still be able to get other jobs   i know some interns who do nothing all day  i know a lot more in the same boat as me  managers treating them like full-time employees on deadlines with vital tasks and constantly under pressure    when tf did internships like this become the norm   how do people live like this for 40  years    at least now i know i never want to work in this sector  i don't know what my other options are though - please feel free to recommend jobs that pay a living wage that don't make you burn out in months  ,ioxm5s

of catching a fish     gt     gt about that time  a businessman came walking down the beach trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday  he noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and

should be working rather than lying on the beach     gt     gt the fisherman looked up at the businessman  smiled and replied   and what will my reward be     gt     gt well  you can get bigger nets

   gt the businessman was getting angry   don t you understand  you can build up a fleet of fishing boats  sail all over the world  and let all your employees catch fish for you     gt     gt once again the fisherman asked   and then what will my reward be     gt     gt the businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman   don t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again  you can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach  looking at the sunset  you won t have a care in the world     gt     gt the fisherman

for me to stay at the same job i have now  even though it's tremendously easy  decently-paying work that i don't have to carry with me outside of working hours or respond to any late-night emails or texts from the boss   it just really struck me hard last night that she and i have had fun hanging out together in our quarantine-ish bubble almost every night for months now without other distractions getting in the way very much  and even though i'm programmed to want more than this  the whole goal of life should be to get to the exact point that i'm at right now  where i get to spend my day in my comfortable house with the dog i adore  working a job that doesn't require an exceptional amount of me  and my night hanging out and having fun with the person i love the most   of course  having all of this and  no  job is the true ideal  but if that life were attainable  there wouldn't be a need for this subreddit   and when i started thinking about the fact that what i have right now feels really good and comfortable and fun  my head really started unwinding when i started considering the fact that i literally could choose to live this exact life for the rest of my days  and there's nothing that requires me to move up  work harder  look for a better-paying job  get another degree  constantly have projects that i obligate myself to  have a side-hustle  work out  have kids  buy a new car  or anything else at all  if i wanted to use my same couches  my same bed  my same tv  all until they literally fall apart  that's my prerogative  if i decided to never apply for another job or seek to move up the financial ladder in any way  i could do that  we could just go on renting this same house forever if we chose to   all of this is obvious  but it struck me as profound  because the need to move up in the world has been constantly embedded as something that i'm  required  to do  i've always been a type a personality  i have the ability and energy to work harder to make more money than i'm making now  and knowing that  it always seemed mandatory that i should work harder  get that side hustle  monetize my hobbies  invest my money in the hopes of making money  and it usually makes me feel guilty when i'm not working hard enough to achieve those ends  because that feeling of  you  can  work harder  so you  should  work harder  has always been deeply ingrained    i've always been more like the businessman wanting to have what the fisherman has  but i think i've finally started to become the fisherman ,im5r5f

841,The corporate elite says they can't pay workers a living wage or they'll go under. Is this bullshit?,   cool  let's look at some companies and see how much money they've spent on those things  current average worker pay is estimated from glassdoor  i'm just throwing some examples in here   if people have interest  i could look into making a simple webpage where you can go through all this data  since it takes some time to run those numbers       home depot       buyback amount  authorized for  22 5 billion dollars on stock buybacks  from 2017-2019      number of employees  400 000    current average worker pay  12 60 hour 26 208 a year     how much workers could make  workers would receive  55 000 in the years of 2017-2019  or  27 500 per year  average worker salary would increase to  51 500  per year   if you make  51 500  per year  your hourly salary would be  26 41 h    amp x200b    starbucks       buyback amount  authorized for  5 93 billion dollars on stock buybacks  in 2018      number of employees  291 000    current average worker pay  11 hour 22 880 a year     how much workers could make  workers would receive 20 378  in the year of 2018  average worker salary would increase to  43 258  per year   if you make  43 258  per year  your hourly salary would be  22 31 h         southwest airlines       buyback amount  authorized for  4 billion dollars on stock buybacks  in 2018      number of employees  61 118    current average worker pay  20 hour 42 000 a year     how much workers could make  workers would receive 65 447  in the year of 2018  average worker salary would increase to  107 447  per year   if you make  107 447 per year  your hourly salary would be  57 h       conclusion   this is just the tip of the iceberg  as we're looking at a limited amount of data and not even accounting for dividends and other things  but i hope that this data helps to shed light on how much wealth is being directly stolen from the working class and redistributed to the wealthy ,imr6k9

851,Feudal Peasants Worked Less Than Modern Wage Slaves. I’ll take the famine and disease tbh.,the great debate why a medieval peasant got more vacation time than you  by lynn stuart paramore   august 29  2013  000000  life for the medieval peasant was certainly no picnic  his life was showed by fear of  famine  disease and bursts of warfare  his diet and personal hygienic left much to be desired           but despite his reputation as a miserable  wretch  you might envy him one thing  his vacation   flowing and harvesting were backbreaking toil  but the peasant enjoyed anywhere from eight weeks to half the year off  the church  mindful of how to keep a population from repelling  enforced frequent mandatory holidays  wedding  wakes and births might mean a week off puffing ale to celebrate  and when wandering smugglers or sporting events came to town  the peasant expected time off for entertainment  there were labor-free sundays  and when the plowing and harvesting seasons were over  the peasant got time to rest  too  in fact  economist juliet for found that during periods of particularly high wages  such as with-century england  peasants might put into more than 150 days a year   is for the modern american worker  after a year on the job  she gets an average of eight vacation days annually   it wasn t supposed to turn out this way  john raynaud eyes  one of the founders of modern economics  made a famous prediction that by 2030  advanced societies would be wealthy enough that leisure time  rather than work  would characterize national lifestyle  to far  that forecast is not looking good   that happened  some cite the victory of the modern eight-hour a day  40-hour workweek over the punishing 70 or 80 hours a with century worker spent toiling as proof that we're moving in the right direction  but americans have long since kissed the 40-hour workweek goodby  and for s examination of work patterns reveals that the 19'  century was an aberration in the history of human labor  when workers fought for the eight-hour worldly  they weren't trying to get something radical and new  but rather to restore what their ancestors had enjoyed before industrial capitalists and the electric lightbulb came on the scene  to back 200  300 or 400 years and you find that most people did not work very long hours at all  in addition to relaxing during long holidays  the medieval peasant took his sweet time eating meals  and the day often included time for an afternoon ooze   the temps of life was slow  even leisurely  the pace of work relaxed  notes for   our ancestors may not have been rich  but they had an abundance of leisure   last-forward to the 21  century  and the u s  is the only advanced country with no national vacation policy whatsoever  any american workers must keep on working through public holidays  and vacation days often go unused  even when we finally carve out a holiday  many of us answer email and  check in  whether we're camping with the kiss or trying to kick back on the beach  ,in3zzs

936,"Hey! I was antiwork for years before I discovered the concept of antiwork. I was like this even as a kid or teen. Anyway, now I basically can't avoid working anymore, and I'll be a wageslave working for pennies at a dead-end job in a third world country. I need to brainwash myself into loving work.",any ideas how  i really  really need to change my mentality or i don't know how i'll survive   with the wages over here early retirement is out of the question  can't cope with drugs either cause they're expensive relative to the wages and super illegal  can't cope with relationships or kids and stuff like that cause i'm pretty antisocial and i'm not really into having kids  the whole legacy thing just doesn't bother me at all   i need to somehow brainwash myself into accepting that 8 or 9 hours a day   commute  for  300 is a good thing  not that making more would change the fact that i'm a wageslave  it would probably just come with more hours  duties and more stress   is there a book or something that can make me accept this  i know this post is stupid i'm just trying to figure something out to make me hate this situation less  can't live hating every second of 9 hours of my day 5 days a week for   45 years ,iki6r7
937,I really don't like working for a company,i started working as a front-end developer in october of 2018  the first company i worked for payed good but the environment was very toxic and it was far away from our home  also they did work for an organisation that i always felt ashamed for working for them and didn't want to work for that company  but the pay was good with flexible hour  after the pandemic started they told us to work remotely for a couple of months and it was awful for me  i struggled concentrating or even being motivated to work so i told myself  that's it  i have to change my workplace  i started sending my resume and i got interviewed for a very big company and i got hired  this company has good environment but the pay is not good  when i started we had to go to work eveyday but again the pandemic got worse and they told us to work remotely on saturdays  mondays and wednesdays  but in sundays and tuesdays we go to work  i realized i'm very bad at remote work  when i'm at home i don't want to work  due to economic problems in my country the dollar's worth got very high and now if my hourly salary is equal to less than 2 dollars  it's awful for a developer  i need to buy an external harddrive and that costs half of my monthly salary  i don't know with these prices how married people with kids live and can afford buying stuff   i also realized i don't like coding for a company  i like coding in general but when it comes to doing it for this job  i lose all my motivation and energy  there are lots of concepts i like to learn but i don't have time for extra learning at work and in my free time i'm very tired   my contract is for three month because i'm a new employee and the first three month is for company to see if they are satisfied with my work and they really want me in the team  i always imagine them saying they don't want me and then with the cold seasons starting and obviously the covid getting worse again in my country  i can spend the rest of the year at home and doing the things i like or maybe i can think of doing something that i enjoy and also getting paid for  but i don't have the guts to tell them myself that i don't want to work anymore  my inner critic always makes me feel bad about these decisions   i don't know if i have the right to not wanting to work like this or i'm just a lazy spoiled person but that's how i feel about working for a company  i like to have freedom  i like to try new things but i always worry about money   i don't know what to do   i thought this subreddit is the right place to talk about this feeling   thanks for reading ,il0lin

948,Walked Out.,  this is going to be a long one  sorry   i mentioned in another post a few months back that i work in the retail department of a restaurant  since the restaurant has reopened following lockdown  going there has been absolutely soul crushing   people happily shopping with no masks on  making fun of us for wearing masks  leaning around the glass barriers at the registers without wearing masks to  hear better  in the last two weeks i have had no fewer than three people hand me something to scan  but not before rubbing it on their uncovered faces first  i cannot understand why  it's just beyond me at this point  truthfully   in addition  people have been far more impatient and angry when they enter our store  despite the dining room now being open  we still get the majority of sales through our to go option  in no way is our restaurant fast food related  but people have come to believe that everything on the menu should take a maximum of three minutes or less to be ordered  paid for and brought out  the restaurant is still operating on a skeleton crew to boot  which only makes people angrier when they find out that even though it's 5 pm on a friday night   there is only one person manning the to go station and doing everything themselves  being a cashier  we get most of the anger taken out on us  the abuse has gotten worse and management has shown their true colors through all of this  though i always have my suspicions of anyone in a management position   they are not even pretending to care about the employees anymore  last week  my coworker and i were chewed out by management on the sales floor in front of customers just because the hostess had stepped away from the podium  i was working on a floor set and we had two cashiers already up there  i dont know why any of that was our fault but apparently it needed to be  shrug     but two days ago  i had enough  i was supposed to be the closing cashier  things were going pretty much the same as usual  but i have long stopped trying to be little miss sunshine on the clock  it takes all of my energy now not to just have a nervous breakdown  i think the issue of whether or not i am smiling behind my mask is irrelevant   anyway  by the middle of the shift  i was tired and fed up with serving people who had no patience or who thought it was funny to refuse to pay for their food unless i said  please  and no  i did not play along   on top of this  my only coworker at the time was a girl who has only been there like a week and a half so  i was doing a bit of juggling   as i'm in the middle of a transaction  new girl asks for my help  the customer i was ringing up conveniently decided to walk away from the register to keep shopping  yep  so i just left my register altogether and tried to help out my coworker   the issue was over the correct amount of change she owed back a customer  everyone who works in retail knows that no matter how long you've been there  if you have officially finished the transaction but the customer  retroactively hands you a random amount of additional cash  it can throw you way off  such was the issue here  so i grabbed the calculator and tried not to panic so i wouldn't struggle to think clearly  the whole time this customer and his little gf are whispering and laughing to themselves and i end up messing up anyway  still laughing quite heartily  the man leans down toward me and tells me how much we owe him  i am panicked and exhausted so all i do is give him a deadpan look and turn back to the calculator  what he said to me next just made me completely snap  he raised his voice at me and in an attempt to i guess intimidate me said   don't you look at me like that  girl  it's not my fault you can't count   and i was just done  i looked at him  said   nope  took off my radio and threw it on the floor  grabbed my things from behind the counter and left just like that   my only regret was leaving the new girl on her own  because that is not like me  but i can honestly say that it happened so fast it was like i wasn't in control of my legs  if that makes any sense   when i got out  i messaged a coworker that they needed to get in touch with one of the managers there because the new girl was by herself and would need help  i know i should have handled that part better  but i was so tired of being humiliated and degraded by these people who don't even see workers as people   i wish i could say i feel relieved to be out of there but i don't   i feel drained and anxious because now it's back to the job hunt and the whole experience  as the people here know  is an existential nightmare   the likelihood of my only being able to find employment in a situation exactly like the one i just left is overwhelmingly high  and i am back to wondering if being alive just for this is worth it  i'm not saying i'm suicidal  i'm just really  really tired and dreading every single second of the future  sorry for the length  but i needed to get this out of me ,ikre7q

952,"Willfully giving up years of your life is a sign of immaturity, not maturity.",most people would say that becoming an adult is learning to be okay with giving up huge portions of your time to  make a living  they will argue that a person is immature if they are unwilling to give up their time in order to participate in capitalist market    in my opinion they have it backwards    not having the ability to recognize the importance of time is a sign of a immature mind  time is integral in terms of the most important aspects of life  spending time with loved ones  seeking wisdom  growing as physically and mentally healthy as we can    giving up your time to do things against your will in exchange for things no human need be deprived of is not a healthy way to spend a life  this is one of the main reasons so many modern cultures are so unhealthy  physically and mentally  we are not allowed to live in a healthy way  and learning to accept this is not a position to be defended or looked up to     market participation isn't maturity  but mistaking it for maturity is very immature ,iktz33

964,I quit!,last week i quit my high paying and very reputable job  yesterday was my last day     why  because it was an absurdly toxic place to work and i don't want to work in a place like that   nothing really ever happened to me  i actually managed to get along with everyone  but i just cannot work in a place that fosters these behaviours   my boss  the dg  was a psycho manipulative narcissist  lacking empathy but being extremely charming and only saying exactly what you want to hear  of course  then he has his watch dogs do his dirty work  telling me what he knows i categorically disagree      our workplace is only women  because he thinks he can control us better  his secretary is proud to work 12h a day and was giving me tips on how to do it  just put some cold water on your face and you're good to go  the women in charge of the legal stuff is clearly not well in her head  worked until she got burnt out last year and thinks all of us should as well  the women in charge of events is proud to have worked 4 days straight without sleeping last year and then having a stroke at 49 years old  the girl in charge of communication does not have the maturity to stand up for herself  so she gets abused daily  working infinite hours with huge pressure from him - of course  last year she worked so hard she reached a point where she could not speak  was completely apathetic  completely burned out  this girl is also clearly losing control of herself  as she just turned 26 and is obese and getting bigger   the only  normal  person there is a girl with whom i got along very well  she has been there the longest and she has testified on court against the company  in a case that they have with her previous boss  somehow  she is still sane and manages to block everything out      in my office i'm alone with 2 women who hate each other  and the dg  who only goes there sometimes  there had been screaming everyday and it has reached a point where one of them threw everything from the other's desk to the floor    so yeah  i'm out     i'm trying to get pregnant and i could not imagine having a pregnancy in an environment like that  feeling stressed everyday  dealing with such a negative workplace everyday  what is better for my family  having lots of money or a happy  stress-free mother wife  my husband works and likes it  he opened his own company  we don't have any debt  we don't have any money issues  i have a good cv and  even immediately after quitting my job i have companies interested in me  we wont be homeless  we wont starve  i don't care about my status  telling people how important my job is  how i deal with such high level people  everyday i was dealing with those people i understood our world is ruled by the worst people - because you need to have a certain type of manipulative and dishonest personality to get to the top  and the higher you are  the less empathy your have for the people below you  the good and smart people leave because they understand they cannot change it  the honest people refuse to contribute to everything that is wrong in our system  maybe i'm not resilient enough to fight it  but i don't have the motivation to try any further  i rather be happy and let them kill each other and ruin the world   i have no job from today on  even though i'm interviewing for a couple of companies  but i'm not going anywhere until i'm confident they are normal people  if i have to work  then let me work somewhere with reasonable levels of sanity ,ikgvld

966,Does the majority of this sub live in USA?, sorry for my probably bad english  i'm 20-years-old living in finland  social security here is great  it is basically possible to not have a job and still have all of your basic needs  sure it makes your life easier if you have a job  but you won't lose your house or starve to death if you don't  also healtcare is basically free   it seems that the situation is pretty opposite to what it is in the united states  so i was wondering if this sub is mostly american ,ikowm2

969,I’m getting paid to do almost nothing.,ever since i ve been working from home i ve had almost no motivation  it s been this way for months  it s already hard to self motivate from home without my online work connection being unbearably slow and or nonfictional sometimes   i feel bad because i care deeply for my coworkers  but i can t bring myself to accomplish anything most of the time    additionally  the chances of me being fired are slim because our pos corporate execs refuse to backfill any open positions  and we re already short two members in my department  i did have to go back into the office for a week and a half recently  and i was actually able to get a lot done then  but ever since i ve been back home i ve been less motivated than ever to accomplish anything    i ve tried applying for some in person jobs in the new city i m living in  but have already been rejected by several i thought i was very qualified for  don t really know what to do anymore ,ikp6gz

971,The Merit Raise system needs to die.,it never keeps up with inflation  even when you get  exceeded expectations   both the employer and the employee lose   it is more expensive in the long run for the employer due to turnover    it does not encourage top performers to go the extra mile  or any type of worker for that matter   why is this the norm now  i work for money  i don't do this for fun  none of us do  no matter how many people want to lie to themselves    i just want to be paid my worth  and i just told my boss  to be honest  going the extra mile and blowing it out of the park isn't worth 1  more  all he said after a long pause was   well  i disagree but i hear you   fuck this ,ikl0f4

974,"They treat us like ""them"", whereas we treat them like ""us"".",your corporate overlords  your boss  may be cordial on the outside  but their mentality is very polarized  they treat employees  you  like another group  a foreign group  like cops vs robbers or masters and slaves  this results in having no empathy for us and in a relationship such that they treat you as slaves and extract everything from you without feeling any concerns or hesitations of morality   in contrast  we the people treat our bosses and employers as  us  we  care  we have empathy because we don't have a dispassionate opinion of them  we see them as humans   my boss is having a hard time cause he shortstaffed so i'll work harder and longer for no extra pay to make him feel better  at a certain level  we  care  this results in empathy  something you should reserve for friends and family  being given to soulless entities with your worst intentions at heart    always be aware of when they're laughing with you  vs laughing at you  spoiler   gt they're laughing at you lt ,ikmr9w

978,Fuck school also,my son starts school next year  and i feel so guilty  i don't want to subject him to the decade plus of institutional breaking  but homeschooling isn't really an option  or it is but i would sucknay it and the hit my career would take is too great  if i stick with what i am doing i have a chance at a decent  middle class  life in a few years  if i bail that's gone     but i remember what it was like  and it was awful  i hated it  i dreaded it every day for about 10 of the 12 years i was there  there was bullying  from students and teachers  and by bullying i mean violent assaults  which for some reason weren't treated as crimes  because nthe perpetrators are only kids right  yeah well so was the victim  in fact usually the perpetrators were older kids  assaulting younger kids  one of the guys who beat the shit out of me ended up on  australia's most wanted  after shooting a security guard during an armed robbery  so treating his assault on me as some kind of interpersonal fluff  rather than the brutal assault it was  didn't work in terms of keeping him out of the system  it did succeed in making me internalise the idea that it was ok for people to hit me and i probably kind of deserved it    that was the worst part  but only by a little  there was also just the constant forced social contact with people i would never have chosen to be around  learning to accommodate ntheir toxic disfunctions and superficial obsessions  since walking away was not an option  the constant endless crble for social status  the grinding  crushing  mind killing boredom was nearly as bad  and unrelenting  constant  endless  stretching on for years and years and never getting any better    the content of what i learned was sometimes interesting  and there was a real mental and personal development  but the format of learning was awful  above and beyond the subject matter what schools teach is conformity  submission  obedience  groupthink    and this is what we do to childhood  the most wonderful magical period in a person's life  when new places  people  conversation freedom  play  imagination  are a source of immeasurable joy - and then we make kids spend it in this prison-like institutional setting   i look at my kid  and his energy and imagination and compassion and sensitivity  and i am terrified of what they will do to that  i had to twist myself into this contorted shape to survive  and it took a long time to untwist myself  if i even have   hopefully he fares better than i did  hopefully he is a bit more robust  a bit more popular  and the school and cohort he joins are a bit less awful than mine were   but i am not excited about how the school as an institution will help him develop and grow  i am overall terrified  worried about the damage it will do ,ikf2w3
