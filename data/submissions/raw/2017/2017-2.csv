0,"Is it bad that I've never had a ""real job"" at 19?","I don't like the concept of work. It's miserable. I've been a long time lurker here, and I love the sub! :)
But anyways.. anyone find it bad I've never had a ""real"" job. I've done volunteering here and there, and gig work, but nothing that would be considered traditional 9-5.
Looking forward to your responses! :)

3,For A Society Without Jobs,"James Livingston (in his new book, ""No More Work"")  directly confronts the issue of socially necessary work with what he calls socially beneficial work, a somewhat slippery concept The former faces the same forces of routinization, speed-up and, finally, elimination like many jobs, whereas the latter retains its desirability – as meaningful work – even though it is often valueless as a source of compensation.
