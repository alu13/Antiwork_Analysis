8,Super cool new company in wellness industry breaking records in sales and passive income in Balkan &amp; Europe,"This is an online network marketing business with a linear matrix and because of unique signing-in of new customers in one downline - recommending new members or sales are not required to make money.

No annoying recruiting! No selling products!

The goal of the company is to create long-term regular customers-consumers who get in return some of the company sales revenue.

🌟 an opportunity for everyone to earn extra passive income!


With a purchase of a 485 € worth packages, a person will receive 6 great certified products and in the first 36 days alone will earn 515 €uros.
Then, every subsequent cycle (which lasts for 36 days) he renews his initial package and gets 970 €.

Imagine this:
You go into the store.
You buy goods for 500 €, and then the store rewards you every 36 days (however, it pays you every 9 days) with 1000 € from the profit you help co-create ...

A person wouldn't believe it if it wouldn't witness it !!

Perfect for people feed up with 9-5 working hours and annoying bosses 👊


Currently available within Balkan region and some EU countries.

Average sales rate in January 2020: 1000+ new customers each few days!

15,Being 23 and in an Office Sucks,"I just need to rant.

I work at a small firm as an office manager temp and I think it has crushed me. Hopefully won't be here through the next year, but who knows. Since it's so small, I see my bosses credit card statements and the invoices form the two other independent contractors that work as a financial director and analyst. They all have a lot more money than me. That, in and of itself, is not the problem. My boss is constantly working, the financial director is constantly working. whatever.

The fucking analyst, who by the way is already well known to be completely socially inept, crashed the computer the firm got him and is going to be given a new one. Now you may be thinking ""oh he just works that hard at his job"". Fucking no. He runs Starcraft and shit on his work computer. This computer, that cost thousands of dollars, that he's had for a year, is breaking down because he's a dumb ass who made as much as I make in a year as his BONUS. And to top that off, he's such a greedy fucker that we can't even get snacks for the office anymore because he steals them and takes them home and we go through them way to fast. He constantly asks for them so I don't know if he's just too stupid to put it together that we don't get them anymore because of him or if he really just doesn't care. AND as I'm listening to a conference call saying they are waiting on files from him, I walk in on him taking a fucking nap in the back of the office. He makes at lease 5X more than me and is an incompetent, sexist, oblivious, condescending ass. His area of the office, I think, actually smells because it's such a mess and leaves coffee cups out constantly. I'm not his fucking assistant. Really, I shouldn't be doing assistant work for anyone except the partners, but it's such a small office I can't say no.

The financial director works hard, but she treats me like I'm an idiot. She is the most baby boomer of baby boomer people that refuses to call herself a baby boomer because at least she's smart enough to know what that connotation is. I literally heard her say the phrases ""if it'll affect profits, they will not implement more environmentally friendly options"" and ""I would not sacrifice convenience for sustainability"" and ""billionaires being that rich gives me hope for myself"". I'm a musician and was telling her about the evil practices towards composers Discovery was trying to implement (they backed off btw) and she says to my face she's thinking of investing in them and that if Discovery can get these horrible new contracts pushed through there's nothing wrong with what they were doing! I honestly thought all those things about baby boomers being so out of touch and only caring about profits and having no concern for the long term effects was exaggerated for memes, but it's all fucking true and I'm at a loss. And to top that all off, she thinks we're the same because she's been taking classes over at a music school in the city, while I've been playing and studying for 12 years, over half my life. But no, she knows exactly how the music industry should work and how to play amazingly because how could there be anything I know more about than her. It's just made me convinced people over 50 like that need to be phased out of the economy if we have any chance of surviving. They're so sure their way of doing things is the only possible way, but their way is what got us into the mess we're in today!

I'm sick of being the catch all for work people don't want to do. I feel like my fucking brain is rotting away and not being used. I'm sick of being around people that are ok with the way things are. I'm sick of being around so many people who are so out of touch with the way things are. I'm sick of this job and I'm sick of feeling stuck in it because it pay $3 better an hour than anything else I can even find on the internet.

18,I had to leave work to go to the hospital yesterday and I’m worried I’ll get written up for how it all went down.,"I doubt this is the place to post this, but I’m not sure where else to put it. 

I’ve been feeling pretty sick for the past week or so...dizzy, high heart rate, migraines etc. I tried to brush it off as “stress” because I have been under high stress at work and in my personal life. However, yesterday at work I became extremely dizzy, hot, and felt like I was going to pass out. Again, I and my coworkers thought it was a panic attack but I just knew something else was wrong. I told them I needed to go to the hospital and I called my husband. (Can’t afford an ambulance) In the meantime, my boss was out on a business visit and we couldn’t get ahold of her. My coworker told to just leave and she would take care of speaking to my boss. Even though I wasn’t feeling well I still stayed to make sure I got clearance from my boss that I “could” leave. I got to the hospital they ran a bunch of tests and a CT scan and I was waiting for results. I updated my coworkers. I got my results back and I have a severe sinus infection which is causing my heart rate/bp to be high, my dizziness, and my severe migraines. I texted my boss that I wouldn’t be in after I got out of the hospital. This was late at night so I didn’t want to call her. This morning I called in to work...albeit a little later than I should’ve (because I was in the hospital all day yesterday!) to “officially” call off of work. My boss said she hopes I feel better etc. but that the policy is to call.... meaning I shouldn’t have texted her last night about my condition. My job wasn’t even open at the time and it was too late to call someone that I wouldn’t be in the next day! Furthermore, I didn’t even know if I would be awake in time in the morning to call in at a “proper” time. (Spoiler alert....I wasn’t) What can I do if they try to write me up?",False,ewrg07,throwmeaway03827,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ewrg07/i_had_to_leave_work_to_go_to_the_hospital/,1,1

Of course I chimed in saying, ""that's ok, Bernie's gonna fix that"" because I truly believe he has a chance. In typical boomer fashion she protested (as she's a biden supporter for some reason) and an argument started (again).

This time it was about jobs (this subs speciality) and she was trying to make the argument that I'm poor because of course, ""YoU JuSt HaVe To WoRk HaRdEr, GeT AnOtHeR JoB.""

Obviously I got triggered because I had TWO jobs and still was sleeping on the floor. Then what happened in January....THEY CUT MY HOURS! And it no longer was worth the shitty management and the yelling for me to go back so I quit. Now I'm down to one job, and the only benefit is that I have time to do my homework.

Need I point out the rest? Based on the cost of rent alone in my area I would need 3 possibly 4 jobs.....JUST FOR RENT! AND THAT'S NOT COUNTING UTILITIES, A CAR NOTE (if I could afford a car), AND FOOD. And then what would be the point? Sure I wouldn't sleep on the floor, BUT I'D NEVER BE HOME! I'D JUST BE SLAVING 24/7 

I would need a partner or some shit to bring in more income, and god knows it's impossible to date when you live at home and don't have a car.

32,"For years, my dad was eager to retire but it was never viable. Mid-2019 he officially announces his retirement. A few months later, he gets diagnosed with cancer.","My dad's been talking about retirement for years, and how eager he wants to enter retirement life. He's been working at the same company for \~30 years. He'd always say to himself, ""This'll be the year I retire"" but he kept delaying it because of finances.

Finally, he makes his retirement official for August 2020. He's got a whole bunch of plans post-retirement: he got a gym membership to get into shape, woodworking projects 'round the house, vacationing, etc. etc. Finally an opportunity to explore and achieve his goals because for the past 30 years, his life has been ""the grind"": work-eat-sleep-repeat.

A few months later, he gets diagnosed with eye cancer. He's had eye problems for years, but the optometrists he visited misdiagnosed him, and for years went for unnecessary treatments for a condition he did not have.

The doctors estimate a life expectancy of 5 - 10 years. His cancer has a very, very high (95%) chance of spreading to his liver, at which point survival rates plummet.

He doesn't seem to give a shit though. He just powers through the news.

I find it sad that a person who has worked hard his entire life finally got the ability and opportunity to retire, to pursue their interests according to their will, only for post-retirement life to be met with grave news.

And, to add insult to injury, his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer the same month.

I don't wanna make it seem like his worklife was unbearable or always undesirable. He did form strong friendships with his colleagues, and these friendships are meaningful to him. He's surrounded himself with good people, and he's grown as a person in what I would call a respected direction.

42,"I belive my office job makes me ""phone addicted""","My phone is like my personal space at work. The window to the things I like, in a cage I'm forced to be in 9hours.

But I'm pretty concerned about my phone usage, because I would like to do so many things and it feels like my phone distracts me from it.

Now, I had vacation and called in sick in the beginning of January resulted in 3 weeks off from work. And in this time I just naturally didn't use my phone because there wasn't any reason, except maybe checking some games Dev news.

The difference is so huge, now I need to charge my phone every day, in my vacations I could go at least 2 full days without recharge. 

And yes you could argue that I could just do work, but I'd rather had to be less hours at work and would accomplish the same. [Or work less days and accomplish more.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/04/overworked-japan-microsoft-tested-four-day-workweek-productivity-soared-percent/)",False,ew1rqu,SemiBird,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ew1rqu/i_belive_my_office_job_makes_me_phone_addicted/,5,1
43,A thought that occurred to me,"So, a big talking point against life essentials (food, shelter, healthcare, clothing, etc.) being considered human rights is “if people don’t need to sell their labor to survive, society will collapse!”

But...basic life essentials aren’t the only things that cost money. I’m willing to bet everyone in this sub has a hobby, or at least something they’d like to have as a hobby if work wasn’t so demanding. Everyone would love to travel, or to learn, or to spend time with their loved ones. So if it was just “essentials are free”, people would still work to afford things they don’t technically “need” but that would make their lives happier.

What would really change, though, is who holds the power. Bosses wouldn’t get to just treat their employees like dogshit anymore, because if they try, their employees aren’t just going to think “well, this sucks, but without this job I’ll starve.” They’ll speak up, or they’ll quit.

And competition for jobs wouldn’t be so stiff, because instead of one person working long hours, it’d probably be closer to a bunch of people working short shifts—after all, if money is just for “nice to haves” instead of essentials, nobody is gonna work for eight solid hours five days a week.

And I think that’s why capitalists try to push the “we NEED to make people work to survive!” narrative.

44,Getting in significant debt for medical school,"I was wondering what people would do in my situation. I am 31 and currently going nowhere. I graduated with a physics degree in 2015. I got top grades but nothing has worked out. I've gotten close to getting on graduate schemes (including a 3 year training course in medical physics which would have been a very good job), but I got rejected.

I applied to medicine in September for the third year in a row and have been offered an interview at one university, but there is a catch - I have to pay the tuition fees myself as I have been offered an interview on an unfunded undergraduate course.

In the UK there are two pathways into medicine - graduate entry (funded 4 year accelerated courses - very competitive) and undergraduate entry (the standard 5 year course). Undergraduate entry is not funded if you already hold a degree, so I will have to pay £36,000 - £9k a year for the first four years (the final year is funded) and I would also have to take out £3500 a year student loans for living costs.

I already ""owe"" £32,000 in student loans, so the living expenses will raise my debt to about £50,000. To pay the tuition fees I would have to take out a bank loan of some sort, totalling about £16,000. The figures are probably more than this as I doubt I can live on £3500 a year.

I just don't know what to do. I could go to the interview, but it would be very hard if I got an offer and then had to turn it down.

I still live at home and my parents are on my case all the time now. Some family members told me to go into accounting, but I have no interest in that and know I would be depressed for the rest of my working life. I would rather work retail. Am I being a brat here? My dad has a ""work to live"" attitude but I don't see the point. I would rather not exist.

45,Civilization only requires 1 month's worth of work in a whole year from each person.,"It is my belief that if all the middlemen in businesses and industries were removed and a system of decentralized planning were put in place, we would all only have to do *at most* a single months worth of work at most to ensure a steady supply of necessities and avaliable surplus(for festivals and crises) for everyone. 

We shouldn't have to work all the time for corporations that don't give a damn about our health, our lives, and our safety beyond what is required or profitable to them.

49,No free time,"work (9.5h) + commute (5h) + sleep (8h) = 22.5 hours. 

Do you want to know what I do on my 1.5h of free time? Lying on bed waiting to sleep to get my 8 hours of sleep. I need to do this because it's difficult for me to fall asleep and if I don't get enough sleep I start dozing off at work which makes my boss really angry. If I do it again I'm gonna get fired for sure.

I eat 1 meal a day thanks to lunch break but there are times I just eat nothing for a full day. And strangely I don't feel hungry at all, just my stomach hurts a bit. I used to eat to stop feeling hungry. Now I eat to stop feeling pain in my stomach. It's like my body evolved and instead of sending hunger signals to my brain which I don't feel anymore, it just creates pain in the stomach area to tell me ""dude you should eat""

I listen to music and daydream about suicide on commute and besides that I have no freedom on weekdays. And on weekends my time is spent on feeling anxious about going back to work.

73,Co-worker asked to lie about harassment; car accident on company time,"I have two jobs. Yesterday, I found out from a co-worker that she had been sexually harassed at work, but our boss told her that she should be flattered and deny that the harassment happened. Our boss is a woman so I feel like she should know better, but I guess not. Anyway, I was shocked and furious. 

Later at my second job, I was driving to visit a client and a truck rear-ended my small car. The other driver didn't have insurance, so it's up to the kindness of my insurance company (ha, ha) whether they will waive the $500 deductible for repairs. I asked my boss if the company would help at all with my car repairs, seeing as I was driving for them. She said probably not, but she would check with HR (sorry, ""people and culture""). Still waiting to hear from my own insurance company about what they'll do.

I have to work that job for 30 hours to make $500. The situation makes me feel like an indentured servant. We're unionizing but still in the early stages.

Also deeply disturbed by the sexual harassment situation. I couldn't even tell my best friend about it because I thought it would be too triggering for her. I knew my boss could be mean. For some reason she's slightly nicer to me than to other people. Maybe because I have called her out a few times. But this is a whole different level.

84,From HATING Work to Millionaire in 2 Years,"# I know this is a clickbaity title but I NEED to get your attention for this one. And I will make it as straight to the point as I can.

**1) YOU DONT HATE WORK.** 

What you hate is **slaving away for minimum wage, doing meaningless tasks, not getting the recognition you deserve, getting told what to do from people that are not competent etc.** The list goes on and on and I know that from experience.

I myself hated my job for 6 years until finally my employer gave me a huge favor and fired me. Now I am so grateful for what was at the time devastating to me. I knew I was not happy at the place but I didn't have the courage to leave. That decision was luckily took care of by a termination without notice.

So now I'm finally ""**FREE""** of the work I hated so much. Free of all the gossip between coworkers. Free of the shitty attitude of my boss. **And I'm not gonna lie it was a huge weight off my shoulders. It felt great.....for a few weeks.** 

After an initial period of relief I started to fall into a hole of meaningless day to day activities. Days filled with constant pleasure seeking like **sleeping in everyday of the week, drinking with friends, watching youtube etc.** What I didn't know at the time was that seeking instant gratification was the opposite if what makes life truly livable.

**2) YOU WANT TO WORK**

Even more you need to work. **You need to pick a challenging task, get after it and feel great about your accomplishment.** If theres no real struggle in the beginning there is no real happiness in the end. Nature built that into us. Otherwise the human race would have never started to build shelter, invented tools and made it this far.

Back to my story: So I'm noch 2 months unemployed and I fail even worse compared to still having a job. **BECAUSE of all the FREETIME. Or better, because of freetime being wasted.**

**So I started picking up tasks I wanted to do for a long time: learning to play the ukulele, read books, working out, meditation, Yoga etc.** I tried a lot of things and the more different things I tried I learned what I enjoy and what I am good at. The amazing thing is that usually the things you enjoy you are good at and vice versa. So through reading a few biographies about Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Philip Knight, Richard Branson I had the urge to try and see if a had what it takes to be an entrepreneur. Just for the reason to take a difficult task and dedicate a few hours **everyday** to see how far I can come. The emphasize  is on **everyday.**

**The crazy thing is that it never felt like work.** It just felt like a puzzle or a game you try to complete. I enjoyed doing it everyday. It was not work, although from the outside it sure looked like it.

**3) YOU WANT PURPOSE**

**What if your current work was meaningful, challenging, rewarding, diversified, respected etc.** How would you feel about work. **You sure would not be ""ANTIWORK"", would you?** 

So the problem is not work. The problem is that your work is not aligned with your core. With what you truly want to do in life. This can be being a teacher, nutritionist, personal trainer, marketeer, dog walker etc. **IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT IT IS. All what matters is that you find that thing (or things) you enjoy. Since you enjoy it, you will be good at it and you will for sure find a way to use that activity to add value to other peoples life.  They will be happy to pay for that activity**

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Transform Your Negativity into Positivity**

How far has being negativ brought you in life? For me it took me straight to depression and unemployment. But you don't have to go all the way like it did. You can use the energy of all that negativity and let it fuel your dream. **Take all that HATE, ANGER, FEELING OF INJUSTICE and put it towards trying out new things. Thats all Im asking.**

I don't expect you to be a superstar in the next activity your trying, nor do I want you to be demoralized after trying 1 (or 20) activities you don't like. **You only need one thing that you truly enjoy with all your core.  You are set for life. You found your so called purpose!**

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Be Grateful and dedicate 100%**

No matter how shitty your situation seems at this point. There are always things to be grateful for. Even if its just that you are alive, breath, are able to experience this wonderful planet. I know this kind sound silly, but it's crucial to remain grateful. **This will put you in a completely different state of mind. A state where your mind is fully positive, sees the solutions instead of the problems and is just fully committed to get you where you need to be.** 

**JUST TRUST THE PROCESS OF YOUR INNER BEING!**

&amp;#x200B;

To close to loop to my personal story. After being unemployed 3 years I never worked a single day. All i did was following my passion and purpose to deliver value as best as I could. This was not only beneficial for my financials, but even more important for my wellbeing. I don't care about the money I make as long as I can continue doing what I love. The money it just a side effect of you living up to your highest potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AND I KNOW YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT.**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR:** 

“Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”

― Mark Twain

91,"My parents are constantly scolding me because I don't want to work, what can I do?","Here is the context:

Last year, I had to find a job because of my parents re saying '*Muh, students, needs to find a job, your hobbys are not paying*' and because I was pissed, I found one at Carrefour (one of the largest retailers of France so basically slavery).

&amp;#x200B;

Because it was a student contract, I '*only*' worked the weekends and one time in the working week (keep in mind school is from 08:30 to 17:30, 5 days a week apart from wednesday where the afternoon was free).

My schedule was a little bit like this:

* Wednesday: 13:00 - 21:00
* Saturday: 8:30 - 21:00
* Sunday: 6:00 - 13:30

This job is everything you can  think of a retail store job: boring, useless and most of all sickening. Not only bosses threat you like shit but customers as well. Also, I was working in the liquids sections so I had to lift big packs of bottles and put them on shelves that are too high if you are a normal human being. During this time, my back started to hurt like hell and because of my parents pression, I couldn't quit.

These guys were paying me like the minimal wages possible because '*You are a student, we can't pay you more, you have no qualifications*'. Also, you had at maximum 30 minutes of pause per half day and one hour to eat (legal minimum). Also, the boss would constantly watch you (in person or with the help of someone like a foreman) and **scold you just because you looked at your watch**.

&amp;#x200B;

After basically two months of this nightmare, exaustion combined to school and back problems I finally made the decision to quit (for the good) but since then, my parents are making me living hell.

They are constantly talking about how '*I cowardly left my job*' and how '*I'll never be enough mature to live on his own*' even if I am one of the best of my class (even without working). 

They are refusing to understand that at first I can't work with my back but also, I just don't want to work since this thing is basically boring and useless.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? The only things that keeps me alive are my passion for computers and graphic design but I feel I won't last longer since my parents are constantly saying all I do is garbage.

93,It's Partially My Fault,"I just discovered this sub and am thrilled you people exist. 

Last year, I quit my mid-six-figure paying job, left my city, my apartment, my life, and moved up into the mountains several hours away from it all. I did this because I was not only fed up with what work had become (pointless, useless, empty) but because I was in a powerful position implementing rules and structures that were only there to get people to work more so I could pay them less. 

I managed a team of 65 people, and I worked together with my business partner to ensure they stayed at the company while paying them as little as we could but offering them as many bullshit tech industry freebies as we could to keep them engaged (turns out, millennials love snacks, beer, and gym memberships). 

I was part of the problem and simply quit one day because I didn't want to participate anymore. I couldn't participate anymore. I didn't have a name for what I felt, it just felt wrong.

Now I fully understand I was lucky to have had 15 years of high paying work under my belt so I could leave without a plan and had the ability to not work while I figured out my next steps. I now consult part-time and that gives me what I need.

But I've spent a lot of time the past few months thinking about how sick the system is and what my role was in it. I read, ""Bullshit Jobs"", I began reading everything Anand Giridharadas wrote and spoke to former colleagues to learn about their perspectives of our industry.

I suppose I'm sharing all of this because I've never shared it before. My family, friends, and colleagues truly think I'm insane for walking away from it all. I've been asked if I am struggling, if I feel unwell, if I need help.

I just realized that the entire system is designed to keep people in the system-and that's it. There are better ways for people to make money and get benefits and spend their time. I don't believe all work needs to be abolished, but that work needs to serve a purpose, and not simply serve the rich. Eight hours a day shouldn't matter. Two weeks' vacation is horseshit. Health insurance tied to your employer? I can't even begin to talk about how fucked up that is.

I'd like to contribute more of my knowledge to this group, share news I see in the business world that frustrates me and give some insight into how and why people like me perpetuate a system that only makes us rich and everyone else a cog.

Its a great trick on the part of the society though. If you train your slaves to love their slavery, you don't have to worry about them trying to get free. They'll even ridicule people who point out the insanity of the current system.

111,Just a morning thoughts that I would like to share with you.,"Hello fellow Idlers,

I noticed that many of you are being hard on yourself. You criticize capitalism (applause), but somehow you always end up being criticized by your parents and ending sentences with: ""my lame ass can't do anything better"" or ""I don't know what else to do"". Well, let's go back couple tens of thousands years ago when we were just developing agriculture. When we went to hunt beasts, it wasn't every man for himself or 1 guy per 1 beast. It was 10 guys with spears and 2 or 3 spears to slow or kill the animal so that all our families can eat. The ones that hit could probably brag but I doubt that they would get 3x more meat. It would be shared and all bellies would be full. If you started hunting with your ancient father at the age of 7, you would be pro 10 - 15 years later. 
What do you do in today's schools. 15 years of obedient learning, stressful learning 80% things that you don't need or forget a year later. Then you decide as grown person to be as good as possible in one field and they charge you fortune, don't care about your 15 previous years and they torture you again. Learning, finding job to serve someone and you give them your life, not just knowledge on the plate.
You find that rational? No? How is then being hard on yourself rational? Don't be!

My family had to move from Yugoslavia during '95 wars and we had to meet all kinds of people in Belgrade, Serbia. From government officials to people on miserable welfare.
Do you really think that surgion knows alot? He is good at his field of medicine and drives car, that's all. He couldn't buy apartment without my brothers assistance, he can't repair car without my father's assistance and we joke that changing a tire would require more assistance to him than he has in surgery room. And he is in his mid 30s. Only people who know many jobs are the ones who had to work many jobs or were forced to learn because of 1 mad parent. Evolution doesn't work by burning neurons at the speed of light but rather doing what you are good at and focusing on what your genetics allows you. Society expects concentration from people with ADD and stand up comedy from people who are introverted or autistic. 
Belgrade, Berlin or Buffalo, they are all insane. We all know this doesn't work for anyone but 3 - 5% of 8 billion people. And you still find place to blame yourself?

114,isn't it weird how people are afraid of machines taking jobs?,"only a short while ago we dreamed of higher productivity, lower working hours, and less inequality. 

if industrialisation continues as it is then machines will soon replace many jobs and ramp up productivity with relatively lower cost in the long run. 
i hear a lot of people using this as a horror story of the future, that the machines are coming for us and will take our jobs and make us all starve. which is firstly unrealistic, as a capitalist society would collapse as soon as the consumers all die off. rich people cannot take money from themselves.  

it makes more sense then to assume that the advent of machines opens us up to not having to rely on a give and take society; that we have in effect come close to achieving that long sought after goal of leisure and creativity. if we establish renewable energy sources and place machines in control of our necessary faculties then we can feed everyone and allow those who once spent their days driving tractors to work on creating more and more advancements to those machines, or perhaps to the food themselves. 

jobs are only necessary because we need money to buy the things we need to survive. but place robots in charge of the unpleasant, repetitive, and unsafe jobs and there is no need to provide an incentive to work, people will do what they wish to do.  success will be measured by progress, not profits. you pick up food at no cost to anyone, you find your place in society through your passion, you work together with all of humanity to make the world a better place. no robbery, no insurance fraud, just people working on the systems the protect us and provide for us. they will not turn on us, because they are an extension of ourselves. 

i do not have all the answers to what may or may not happen in the future. but it seems obvious to me that we should work towards mechanising the world, harnessing renewable energy, and helping others. 

i am but one person alone evaluating a culture of capitalism that seeks to become rich in the short term and benefit from the material wealth that it provides. we are afraid of losing our jobs, of being poor and starving. but if we could all lend a hand to each other and work together, we could achieve a free society of progress and passion. 

obviously, dont praise the employers that lay off millions of workers to replace them with machines. but work towards your government giving everyone the right and ability to exist, and make mechanisation both a possibility and a sustainable necessity. in order for us to transition from human driven labour to robot driven labour we have to make it possible for humans to be replaced. and that means sustainable services that help people gain upward momentum such as education, shelter, and food. 

your government may seem corrupt, but it works for the people. change the minds of those who fear a change in society and rally everyone together. this is a three step process; give people the ability to survive without jobs, remove the jobs and replace them with renewable energy powered machines, give people the resources they need for free and allow humans to reach their full potential. 

tl;dr robots are the ANSWER not the problem. your government and your employer is the problem.

The industrialism was horrified to find the
fisherman living beside his boat, smoking a

pipe.

 

“Why aren't you fishing?” asked the
industrialism.

“Because I've caught enough fish for the day.”
“Why don't you catch some more?”

“That would I do with them?”

“Barn more money. When you could have a
motor fixed to your boat and go into deeper
waters and catch more fish. That would bring
you money to buy non nets, so more fish,
more money. Soon you would have enough to
buy two boats, even a fleet of boats, then you
could be rich like me.”

“That would I do then?”

“When you could sit back and enjoy life.”

 

“That do you think I'm doing now?

128,Plan to minimize dependency on capitalistic society - do you think it is possible?,"I have been thinking about this plan for some time and now I ask you, fellow antiworkers, do you think it can be done?

1. Buying homestead with large established orchard and woods - fruit trees are relatively easy to maintain and I love to eat fruit very much, so much it has become my main staple. So essentialy orchard would help to keep food costs a little bit down and it will be healthier than store-bought fruit. I am planning to also have root cellar to stock fruit during winter months. There will also be woods which could help me keep my heating costs down. For basic electricity I will have a pair of cheap solar panels, so no electricity cost there.
2. Surely there will be some expenses left. Land tax, public water (it is obligatory) , expenses for food which I will not produce myself (rice, oats, yogurt etc.) and some heating. I planned to save the amount to keep these things paid but there is the inflation thing so I guess I will have to invest to win a battle with it? For transportation I will use my bicycle - store and all other infrastructure is reachable with it.

Yes, there will be a lot of work... But it will be more enjoyable and since I will not have my daily job anymore I will have a lot more time. I will have to live frugally but I will be happier in the end.

So, what is your opinion, is it doable? What would you change in that plan?",False,evpel4,on_the_mike,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/evpel4/plan_to_minimize_dependency_on_capitalistic/,6,1

133,What's your plan (if any) to disattach yourself from this system and gain more work life balance?,"*Serious responses please, not suicide*

Some examples: 

1. FI/RE (Early Retirement/ Financial Independence) - seems bizarrely the lowest and highest risk plan for those of us starting out. Basically spend the prime days of your life living quietly and frugally at a chance to be 40 and live off dividends or assets. To what guarantee your health or the system stays the same in the next few decades is unknown 

2. Pass the labor on to those below you. Basically start a company or accumulate property and have workers or property managers accumulate wealth for you. Like FI/RE it can take years to set up and the risk here is higher. Also the enviorment is starting to favor bigger conglomerates as monopolies form so this is getting harder and harder

3. Relocate to a culture where work life is viewed differently and work isn't the main life driver. Which is difficult since these places seldomly exist.

149,Intergenerational bullshit,"I’ve been thinking about how antiwork can be applicable to school. Growing up, the importance of school was emphasized very heavily in my house. My parents both grew up in a tiny East African country and were the children of subsistence farmers. My dad now works at an organization in New York City thanks to the opportunities being educated afforded him. So I’m not shitting on school entirely because I wouldn’t be here typing this if my dad hadn’t been lucky enough to receive an education. However, there are so many stupid, negative ideas that get drilled into the heads of students. Some of which I saw through and some of which I didn’t until recently. 

“But if I don’t get good grades then I wont get into a good school and if I don’t get into a good school then I won’t get a good job and then I’ll have a bad life!!!!!” 

This was a common refrain among my classmates in the honors classes. It was such bullshit and even the teachers would be charmed by this devotion to school for sake of having a “good job” and “good life”. My friend and I find it funny that most of our peers who had that attitude didn’t even end up going to ~prestigious~ schools. Like a lot of them went to state schools (which is totally fine!) but I just find it ironic because they could have gotten there with half the effort. I kinda feel bad for them because during high school, they seriously neglected their mental and physical health and for what? A so-called “good life”. 

While I never got swept up in thinking that the difference between an A and a B would determine the rest of my life, I did absorb some of those harmful ideas that I have to be productive all the time to be worth something. This idea was especially insidious for me because I have ADHD and have struggled with being productive and focused my whole life. I hated myself for not being able to be the perfect student and held myself to really high standards to basically punish myself. In tenth grade, I found an online community of really dedicated and organized students and would wish I could be more like them. 

Things took a turn when I read a blog post from one of these students. She was like twenty and she wrote about how she had spent the last semester working herself to the bone taking seven classes in one semester and working TWO jobs. Her health deteriorated to the point where she was fainting but the blog post wasn’t about learning from that. It was about how through her efforts, she graduated early and got accepted to law school, making her the youngest student there. She said she was proud of herself for what she had done and it’s not like she isn’t a seriously accomplished person but at what cost???? What’s even scarier is that at the time that I read the post, I wished I could be more like her. Looking back, I can see how insane that was and it’s just so shocking to me. 

I’m nineteen now and I’m working to get past that productivity at all costs mindset. I’m glad I never had the discipline to push myself to that level. I feel really bad because my generation had to deal with a lot of pressure to succeed from a very young age. I get that we’re lucky we don’t have to be child laborers but it’s just insane how we’re inundated with this capitalist nonsense. Things are just so competitive these days and the middle class is getting smaller and smaller so I don’t blame my peers for pushing themselves so hard.

Yesterday I taught one class, but had to cancel my others because I felt like I was fighting off a panic attack all through the first class.

The guy spends 40 minutes asking me a mix of standard corporate BS questions and overly personal questions (including ""who's your best friend""). I don't have any friends, what the hell does that have to do with a tech support job? 

&amp;#x200B;

I ""miss"" two questions since I didn't memorize the company's CEO and when it was founded and also didn't deliver a convincing ""sell"" near the end of the interview. Whatever. The guy tells me that based on my resume that I can do the job but he asks all these questions to find a good ""fit"". Whatever. He then says that I'm on the borderline of being hired and that he wants to send me some info and have me do a Skype presentation on it. What the FUCK???? A presentation on my own time, for free? Hell no. He asks what I think, I tell him it sounds like unpaid work. He says it's not unpaid work since the company isn't profiting on it. I refuse and he ends the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is it not enough that I can do the job? He literally said I could do the job. Why do employers insist on having you jump through as many hoops as humanly possible? Not to mention the salary was on the lower end since I don't have any prior experience. He claims he's not trying to low ball me but he obviously is.

156,I’m not taking advantage of you just because I need to take time off sometimes.,"Please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit for this rant. There are aspects of work that I’m realizing are so damaging to the human spirit.

I work at a family owned business (not my family) as a healthcare provider (hourly).

There are a couple issues I run into: 1. Who is my boss (owner or owner’s wife or both)? 2. I allegedly take too much time off which affects my availability for appointments. I have only taken time off for doctor appointments, illness, and very occasional family events (i.e. wedding and thanksgiving). 3. I need to maintain my license by completing continuing education (live webinars) but apparently that is severely limiting even though it’s two hours per week and I offered to come in early or stay late.

I don’t like being treated like I’m taking advantage of them all the time. I work my ass off. But I’m not going to ignore my health problems just so I happen to be available at all hours. And I’m not going to avoid continuing education because then I wouldn’t be able to practice at all.

I’m so irritated at the tone that implies I’m ungrateful or using them when they clearly have the position of power. What scares me is that it’s like this no matter what. Every job has management that somehow does not understand the perspective of the worker and has lost what they used to know when they were in that position. It’s all about production and sales. Then I’m expected to see things from the boss’ perspective When they don’t attempt to see it from mine. Yes, I know you want to stay in business, but what short term thinking. This is how I’m spending the hours of my life and it’s depressing and there’s somehow no escape.

I’m trying to be a good person and help people through my work. But how on earth do people spend their life among ungrateful bosses and customers? I’ve had varied advice: accept that this is who they are, try to compromise, recognize that this is just for a period of time to build your resume...

I get migraines pretty frequently. Not just really bad headaches. Full blown migraines. Half of my face goes numb and I lose vision out of one eye, typically. I also vomit a ton. 

Yesterday I was scheduled 4-close (typically 4-11ish) and I began to get a really bad migraine around 12. I waited to see if it would improve until around 1:30, until I started losing my vision and started vomiting. Like, 2+ toilet trips and 3 large McDonald cups full type of vomiting, to give you a picture of how bad it was. 

My employers know about my migraines, and I usually power through them, but I just couldn’t today. 

I work in a kitchen, and legally
 (or ethically) I am not allowed to work with or around food if I’ve vomited in the last 24 hours. 
The manager got a massive attitude with me, asking if I knew I was supposed to get a doctors note, and hung up. I have never been late and this was my first time missing a scheduled shift (aside from leaving early ONCE)

I’m not shelling out a 50 dollar urgent care copay to get a note for a chronic condition that even specialists can’t treat. Especially when I work part time for 10 an hour with no benefits. 

They don’t pay my copay or provide me with health insurance. Who the fuck do they think they are? 

Had my boyfriend make a fake note and took a picture of my vomit, as a small fuck you to the place that’s been insanely abusive and toxic as it is.

179,I can't process this,"TL;DR:
Head of department complaints about having a weaker contract than two decades ago in the same company, but is also upset about it if our union tries to change that. 

Pre Story: 
One year ago, after my constantly growing company started to threaten to shorten the holiday payments from the assembly-line workers, my co-workers and me started an works Council and joined an union (ig Metall). It's the biggest union of germany. This union use to make contracts with companies in which every worker in every company gets the same payment and benefits if they do the same work, regardless of everything else. Google translate it to ""wide collective"" (Flächentarif). It also is kinda the best contract you can get.

And we are currently fighting for those contracts.

My company is pretty old and was meanwhile bought by three different companies.

Main story:
Now one of those old guys who work here since ever came in and starts to chat a little with my boss, who also works here since ever (which is the only reason he is a boss, becaus he sucks at managing, but that's another story.). They also have older, better contracts than us ""new"" workers.

And he says: ""ah remember when we begun here.. blablabla. This company bought us and set our working time from 37h up to 40h without adjusting the wages. blabla. When I think about my grandparents had to work 6 days a week and they fought for a 5 days week, that was great."" 
He was so proud of them, but IN THE SAME SENTENCE he shits on our Unions goals ""And today? They try to fight for 35h weeks. Is that believeable? You can forget that. That's is nothing.""
You know, actually saying nothing about it, just pushing it down. Oh yeah and of course my boss joined in.

Like wtf. How can you be upset to have a shittier contract than two decades ago, but also be upset if we try to change that.

I could bring up a lot of such stories, but this one just happened this week and I still can't process it.",False,esqojd,SemiBird,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/esqojd/i_cant_process_this/,1,1

4. Of all the positive emotion, very little will come from attaining things, they'll

6. Met a job, even if it's not the one you want.
7. Mind friends and date.

10. Small, according gains, that repeat, are incredibly powerful.

192,Chatty coworkers who are too dumb to even know they're NARCS (a vent post),"I always considered myself friendly and outgoing -- able to hold, enjoy, and even  totally carry a conversation -- but at work I shut down my chatty teammate constantly. I'm downright antisocial, headphones on with nothing playing through them, no good morning or how's it hanging, nothing. Why?


Well for one thing, he's an idiot and a kiss ass. But he's also obsessed with small talk. Always asking me the most mundane shit (""what did you have for dinner last night?"" like...???) and being nosy about my personal life (he has asked questions that were obviously ""subtly"" trying to find out if I'm single, dating, or a lesbian.) When we shared an office I avoided even going to the bathroom because I had to pass his desk and that meant 5 seconds of headphone-free conversation opportunity. I couldn't reach into my bag or open a desk drawer for anything, because any noise I make, he's slipping his headphones off one ear, listening intently for anything he can react to with The Almighty Spoken Word. He even comments on anything I eat or drink, which I fucking hate for plenty of reasons, not limited to some eating disorder adjacent issues. I HATE FEELING OBSERVED CONSTANTLY BY THIS MAN. Tell me how I'm supposed to respond to him exclaiming ""Cheezits again!"" or ""Oh didn't go with the Cheezits this time?"" (Oh right - I don't.)


I'd bet anything he's a dude who listens to ""Charisma on Command"" videos while brushing his teeth, memorizing ""how to start a conversation with anyone!"" but it's all a fake office persona for ladder climbing. Everything he says to me is like he's my camp counselor, and I'm a kid with a troubled home life, and he thinks there will be an Oscar-winning movie one day, commemorating his noble efforts to coax me out of my shell. But I have no shell, and he has no charisma or conversation skills and he's the only one who doesn't know it. And worst of all, he's a snitch and he's too stupid to realize it.


I'm sure he's ~~read some book~~ listened to some podcast that says, in order to truly #hustle to kiss as much ass as needed to become a CEO (lmao), you need to remember any little snippet a person says and then relentlessly beat it to death.


Before I got wise, I mentioned (half) jokingly that instead of implementing our big software upgrade, I was going to buy a one way ticket to Spain and just say ""I'm not coming back, I'm hanging with hot Spanish guys."" The result: weeks, weeks, WEEKS of him responding to unrelated shit with ""gotta get those hot Spanish guys right?"" and, in earshot of ANYONE IN THE HALLWAY, ""have you talked to [manager] yet about going remote / moving to Spain?"" Like, fuck OFF dude. See if I EVER try to be nice and friendly to you again when you blab my business like this.


Same with weed. I made it known I partake, but I only use implicit language and speak quietly because... I'm... at... work. Cue this dumbass openly talking to me about weed, other drugs I don't even use, telling me he just bought weed from ""his guy,"" like not even a story just stating the fact for clout, blah blah blah. With an open office door to a *very* busy hallway!


Once he bopped into our office saying, upbeat and high volume, ""Hey, [coworker] said he's gonna quit and go to graduate school in Ireland, sounds like something you would like"" and I thought... hmm... sounds like something [coworker] probably doesn't want this jackass using as conversation fodder where any manager could overhear. So I go chat with [coworker] and tell him to be careful with what he tells my teammate, and [coworker] looks rattled and says he'd *just* told my teammate that, and that he needs it to stay on the DL. Well of course, that's obvious to anyone with a brain.


Anyway, there's nobody I can complain about him to who hasn't already heard it a hundred times. I just gotta say, my manager is a pretty difficult woman to get used to, and she doesn't mince words, and there have been many times I was afraid she hated me and was going to fire me, but still nothing, NOTHING, has ever made me want to quit like this teammate does. Sometimes I can hardly get out of bed thinking about how I've got to tolerate him another day. Sometimes I don't, and call in sick.


I can't stand him. I can't stand how antisocial he has made me become out of self preservation. I hate him for that. And I hate office life for just being LIKE this, like this is just HOW IT IS, and I'm the fucking weird one for opting out of the good mornings and the what did you have for lunches and the how was your weekendses and the did you see the newses.


**TL;DR** Teammate sucks. Coworkers in general are probably not your friends, not for real. Give them nothing.

208,My case: is this normal? Did I do the right thing?,"So for context I am European and live in a poor European country. Even though unemployment rates having been hiting low values, the salaries are very low with the average being around 900€/month while rent of a room in one of the major cities is around 400€ month (room, not apartment). 

I graduated in Pharmaceutical Sciences 3 years ago and since then had several experiences. Pharmacy, hated it. Then 6 months of call center jobs until I found something better. 6 months in a consulting company that randomly fired half of the people they had hired because after 6 months they finally admited they precipitated and should have only had hired the people after getting the projects, which then they didn't get. Then 3 months of unemployment, 14 months of a research grant. This was experience was good but research is quite unstable here, you don't get social security protection, one of my bosses was a bully and the other one was a great person, but a bit too slow... and maybe dement. 

So I decided to enroll in a programming bootcamp. In fact I was applying to PhDs abroad but didn't get any so then I started doing another master in Bioinformatics but the bootcamp opportunity came up and seemed good. These bootcamps here cost around 6000-6500€ for three months of full time training (8h/day). This one was organized by a human resources firm, was free and they paid us a small monthly stipend. It lasted 3 months (but part-time, 6h/day) and then after 3 months we would have a 6 months internship in a consulting firm. During this period if we quit we would have to reimburse the human resources firm. 
In the end after that 3+6 period the company in which we interned would give us a contract and we would have to give preference to accept that contract or refrain from accepting a contract from competitors for a period of 3 months after the training. Also, they said that the conditions offered by the company vary but on average, most of them asked for a permanence period of 9 to 12 months, in which if we quit, we would have to pay back to the company the value of the training.

So, it seemed like a good deal and I took it.

Fast forward to the 3rd month of the training (thus the last month of the theoretical training just before starting the 6 months internship), the company of the internship invites us for a meeting and gives us a contract that we would have to sign now and that would force us to accept a contract after the 6 months of training (whilst before we had to give preference but were not forced to) and furthermore, that contract would have a 24 month permanece clause.
Me and some coworkers spoke out and declined to sign so everyone else (15 people) declined to sign. The human resources company had meetings with the other company, and this time they call us to have individual meetings with which one of us to present the new proposal. In this new proposal the permanence period decreased to 12 months, but the work hours would be more and also we'd still be forced to sign now and not after the internship. This company is a multinantional consulting firm with a terrible reputation of making workers staying overtime (more than the other consulting firms). 

I declined again to sign the contract. I said I would like to do the internship with them but would only analyze the contract in the end of the internship like it had been initially told me and liked I have agreed upon (and in the training contract I signed it only says I have to give preference to their contract in the end of the training). They said if I don't sign I won't have the internship with them, so I didn't sign because I don't like coercion. 

However this time, of all the 15 people of my training only me and another one did not sign. All the rest did. 
The salary is around 1200€/month which is a bit above the national average and it's good because we only have a 9 month bootcamp. But I just don't understand why they want so bad for us to sign now! 

I believe they want to trap people because when they realise during the internship they will have to work not 40h/week but 50h/week or more, maybe in the end people would prefer not to sign with them and wait three months to free to search another job. But they claim nobody will force you to work more than 50h because it's illegal (even though on online reviews I read comments of people who say they work 11h to 12h/day) and they also say the training is very expensive and thus they need to have assurance.

During the internship we'll be getting less than half of what a junior does, so I believe the training (which I highly doubt costs what they claim it costs which is 10550€ per person) will be paid in those 6 months. In any case even if they need more time to pay off the invesment, why was I told in the beggining I would only have to sign after the internship and the average would be 9-12months?

All my colleagues say they are satisfied and that this is the better offer possible, all the rest are much worst. I still felt I was being mislead and not treated with transparency and declined to sign. Was it a stupid move or did I do the right thing?",False,etkns3,Shadowgirl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/etkns3/my_case_is_this_normal_did_i_do_the_right_thing/,12,1
209,I complained about a lazy coworker and it backfired. Now what?,"To summarize, I work in a very disorganized team and after one person had quit I got their workload on top of mine. My current work depends on what John (one rank higher) does. When I got the position I noticed that I was being asked to do things that were not in my job description. To give you an idea, all others in the same rank as John have three projects and do reports that I depend on to enter information to databases. John has one semi project where he enrolls patients and submits their biopsy requests. After we get the biopsy reports I do a weekly presentation, summary of results, and update two databases. In reality John should be doing all those things and I should only be responsible for database work. 

I tried to be very diplomatic and professional and tell my manager of what was happening. My manager is non confrontational and wouldn’t do anything. I ended up expressing how I had too much work load to do the presentation so he would take it since the presentation had a treatment history part (something only John and others in his rank should be doing and 100% not in my job description). As expected, John says he doesn’t know how to do treatment history so I teach him how (also not my job because I’m not supposed to be doing that part anyway). And after he does it once he comes to me saying the main doctor (Sarah)  responsible for the study wants the treatment history on the summaries I prepare. I said “ok, so you gotta do the presentation before u do the summary so I can copy it” and he casually says “no I think you should do it” and walks away. 

It rubbed me off wrong so I told my manager (let’s fall her patty) again the day after, patty says ok write me an email with this and I’ll figure it out. Turns out patty forwarded my email to the team lead (Abby) and Abby went to Sarah and told her what I said about John word for word. After I had already left work I get frantic calls from the big boss Sarah’s assistant and Abby about coming to an urgent meeting. Since I was already out I called patty to ask what had happened and basically they called John and told him what I complained about word for word and were wanting me to come to the meeting. Basically they staged a confrontation instead of reminding him of his job description. 

Now Sarah wants to hire a new person to take over the study with John so I would be back to my older projects (I guess I was semi fired? Lol). John is UPSET  and according to patty denied everything I had claimed. And the real kicker is that Sarah said the parts John should be doing are “easy” and I had no right to complain about having to do it. This is not the point, this dude gets paid twice I do and it’s his literal job to do those parts, not mine. 

So I’m stressed out and tense to say the lease. I have a lazy coworker with a grudge and a boss who thinks I’m a slacker. I regret saying anything and I’m scared I’ve gotten on her bad side and what if she will want me completely off the team?? Before all this I was supposed to be taking two weeks off so I’m dreading coming back to this work environment with hostile people and don’t know how I’m supposed to closely interact with them. I was honestly expecting my manager patty to email him privately and explain what his job entails and what mine does. But I knew she was non confrontational and she ended up making this ten times worse than it was. 

I know I made mistakes but the reaction I got is scaring the hell out of me, what do you guys think will happen? And what steps should I do besides looking for a lateral transfer before she fires me (my fiancé says I’m overreacting and I won’t be fired but I honestly don’t know)? Any help appreciated.

225,[Rant] Why I need Medicare for All,"Bare with me while I rant for a moment.

I’m 28 years old. I work for my local city government. I have two jobs (I teach part-time on top of my government job). 

This year, I was able to be enrolled in my job’s health insurance plan. I sustained a gnarly injury last year that I haven’t yet recovered from, so I was very excited to get better health insurance to take care of my healing. 

Today was, as I’m sure it was for many of you, payday. I don’t make a lot of money, but over the last couple of years I’ve made enough. I’ve struggled, but I also don’t work full-time. That’s the trade off I’ve made. I struggle a little bit but I have more time for myself. It’s worked for the most part. 

Well, today the money was pulled from my check for my employer-based health insurance. And, lo &amp; behold, 2/3 of my paycheck has disappeared to pay for my health insurance. 

Because of this, I can’t pay my rent. I also wouldn’t be able to afford my copay at the physical therapist I’m seeing if it weren’t for the help I’m receiving from my parents. I have to go into greater credit card debt to pay for groceries  until I get paid again. My car payment has to be delayed.

This is it. If I want health insurance, then one of my two monthly checks will be spent on it. It’s increasingly difficult to live a life to find meaning in. (Don’t read too much into this — I’m not suicidal, I’m just bummed out right now). I don’t get how I’m supposed to make this work, but I guess I’m gonna have to find a fkn way. 

In the meantime, if there wasn’t a fire under my ass before, I’ll be spending every free moment I have canvassing and phone banking for Bernie Sanders because (at the ripe old age of 28) I need Medicare for All.

242,Mental health days,"I finally told my boss today that I'll be taking the rest of the week off. I called my GP earlier this week already, as I was feeling the inability to cope with my work environment reaching a breaking point. This is the result of a year of professional disasters plus the usual: feeling underappreciated and overworked, and generally abused by the corporate machine.

This morning, for the umpteenth time I woke up heaving and crying at the prospect of having to go to work while it's dark, spend the day in the office with people I can barely tolerate on a good day, then go home when it's dark again. 

I'm also 6 months pregnant so my mental and physical wellbeing should come first and it's more important than productivity and serving my corporate overlords.

However, I can't get over the anxiety and worker's guilt I feel over leaving. I keep thinking it's unjustified, because I'm not ""actually sick"" - although I'm not paid nearly enough for all the stress to be worth it.

Does anyone have any tips on how to cope with the guilt?

249,"I finally will not be doing shift work! But of course, my job wants to fuck with me first.","I have a job where I get my schedules each week and in the schedule I can be put anywhere (up to 2 hr commute one way, usually an
hour at least) and at any time. For example, eight to four one day with an hour commute in between and then the next day midnight to eight.

This kind of life is extremely exhausting and I have no motivation to do anything because I am completely tapped out at the end of the day. The other problem is that you may get one day off, but rarely two in a row. 

However this all changes next week when I get a regular schedule. It’s finally over!

But as one last fuck you, for this week they gave me one of the worst schedules I’ve ever had and some of the longest commutes all week into my new regular schedule where I will work exclusively midnight shift and I will be close to home.

I think part of this fuck you is because I have another job that I have to be at this weekend, which they hate when I go. Long story. 

But I’ll be working nearly two weeks straight on some real shitty scheduling. I’m so frustrated and no one close to me seems to understand why or cares.

252,Why do I feel so guilty about days off ill?,"I crashed my motorbike on Sunday, got checked in hospital, didn't break anything, no major damage but lots of bruising, slight concussion and as you can probably guess an intense headache and overall fatigue. I spent the last few days mostly sleeping - I haven't been really fit to do anything else. When in hospital, I caught (of course) a virus, so now I'm not only bruised and battered, but also have a horribly sore throat. To top it off, on Monday I got my period and on Wednesday I had an allergic reaction (I'm allergic to dust and cats, I was seeing a doctor for a prescription for a nasal spray and I guess he must have a cat?), which always results in a whole day of sneezing, puffed eyes, runny nose and headache misery. It's completely normal to take a few days to recuperate, yet I feel so goddamn guilty having to call in every morning to repeat i'm not feeling well enough to come in. It feels humiliating as well, having to ""report"" to someone on your physical condition, as if they own you. Why I can't just say ""I had an accident and i'm ill, I'm gonna need this week off"" and not have to call in every single day is beyond me.

I've been patient, I have smiled, I have told them what they wanted to hear and finally, I have received an answer. So this is the offer they made me: 400 euros plus a 100 euro flexibility bonus that I have no idea what consists off. So I give you this.

Am I supposed to measure my shampoo and toothpaste to stretch it in order to save money? Also I am a human being, that needs hobbies, and entertainment. I want to go out with friends and maybe afford a vacation ONCE A YEAR.

 I don't know about you, but I don't take kindly to people telling me what to do especially if they can't even come do it themselves, especially w/o any mannerisms or regards for my time or livelihood but instead just have some bootlicker recite their draconian narratives to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

NO, what we really need is independence, I don't need a ruling class, espeically ones who don't listen or pay their teachers they have to thank properly, I need money, stimulation and sometimes a little craziness to let lose my inner animal to clear the air about how I feel about what makes me angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have the internet we can work together on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would be an open Neo-Union, a national organization to uphold everyone's every day just and noble ventures in our world w/o a head office for them to bury in paperwork and lawsuits, it would be more a code to be followed if anything. 

But it could be organized to help and endeavour change into a societal epidemic of mass humanitarian oversights masquerading as an equal opportunity for everyone.  

This is isn't a do things nicely type deal, this is a get tough on them like they are on you with their power.    With enough support after proper execution of actions we could see things like blacklists for companies to not work at ever, also the opposite but to get tough we need to fight back till we are putting people out of business entirely.  It would be from what your own government uses against whole nations to starve populations, sanctions.  Enforced through seizing the means of freedom from unethical companies and giving their employees a better opportunity by informing them of alternative lifestyles to the corporate world and/or directly hiring them elsewhere.  Eg. help clear delusions of ideal presentability and such by skill training to cover some basic needs such as tailoring and raw ingredient processing in places like the kitchen. 

(I am saying if you want to have tattoo sleeves and such at customer service jobs, etc with presentability, not skipping showers and such that is horribly horribly wrong!)

You shouldn't have to do anything alone, you should never be miserable about what you earned if it is fair, you wouldn't accept most the offers they give you if these people came to you from a classified ad you placed, time isn't a currency and currency isn't (shouldn't) be a measure of survivability but they've forced our hand by allowing us to be breed and trying to forbid using the natural world, which frankly should be regulated heavily but why the fuck aren't community orchards and stuff more prevalent where anybody can go pick some fruit for their next meal?  Does that not sound fair if you choose to not work?  At least the community still has your back in a non-aggresive way.  And for crying out loud, we have enough homes for people who can afford them, build homes anyone can afford, especially the homeless, which can be done relatively cheap. Anyone would be much happier with a mini personal space than no space at all.  

The only answer to this is to fight the mental battle we haven't yet fully engaged in as an actually organized force.   Don't be that useful idiot who does nothing, you've been doing that this whole time and it has lead you here.  No you have to take this on if you want a better future, you don't even have to like the next person in line for this, you both want the same thing, pettiness is a virtue of the weak and everybody needs to be strong mentally, we need to make them come to us, we need to be the achille's heel to them we know we are.

Do not try and sweep this under the rug, they wouldn't be able to just replace everything with AI overnight, and well surely they will always have loyal wage slaves and such as well.  But the assassination of heavily ingrained corrupt principles isn't supposed to easy.

260,TW: Talk o/ Suicide [19F] Feel so dysfunctional because I can't hold a job down. I feel absolutely trapped.,"Since 17 I've had a handful of jobs, all of which have lasted less than four months due to — surprise, surprise — diagnosed depression and anxiety. Naturally, however, it's my fault I can't hold down a job. 

I've felt suicidal multiple times but according to both my mum and her partner, I'm not disciplined enough; I'm nothing more than a snowflake, it seems, incapable of handling stress, pressure etc, etc. I wanted to pursue university and study psychology, but it's just occurred to me that throughout I'll have to work part-time on top of studies, and as someone who's already struggling a week into a new job, I just don't think I'm fit for this society. 

Everyone suggests going to the GP, but they're absolutely useless, and so are counsellors. I can't even afford private therapy — that of which the NHS offers is terrible, and the waiting lists are extensive. I'll be honest, I just don't see myself making it past the age of 22 at this point, and I'm aware of how incredibly morbid that sounds. Even more so, I look forward to death, and especially knowing I've control over when I can or can't take it — almost like a sense of relief which gets me through the day. If something goes horribly wrong, at least I can just kill myself.

Please don't tell me to seek help. You and I know that other than this, there's nothing, and any argument which suggests otherwise was just created by the opponents to keep us in the mouse trap. Anyone remember Émile Durkheim's study 'Le suicide'? Sort of feels like that, doesn't it?

261,I am an idiot. Dont make the same mistakes as me. Learn from my mistakes.,"So I was told to post this here. Let me first establish a background before I talk about my ""performance review"".

**Background**

I am a 31 year old guy. I work as a software engineer. In the last two years I decided to improve myself and give my 110 percent  to everything I do in life. I achieved many big goals in my life due to my changed mindset and recently passed all the five dutch language exams to qualify for the nationality. I also lost a lot of weight and I am on my way to gaining six pack abs. Still a long way to go but I have a flat stomach for the first time in years.  

I decided to apply the same principles everywhere, including my work. The cream rises to the top after all right? 

I have been killing myself for the last ten months. I finish a task as quickly as possible and pickup the next without wasting time. While some colleagues are waiting for the next day to pickup new tasks, I pickup a new task as soon as I finish.  If the tasks are finished in the sprint I pickup tasks from the next sprint. In the current sprint I did more than three times the work compared to  other members of the team. We are ahead of the planning as well. Not only that I offered to do every single team demo when other people didnt want to do it.

Few weeks ago there was a planning week at my company. No one was doing work on the planning days. I squeezed in 16-20 hours of work in between those meetings.  That was the reason that at the start of the sprint I had already finished most of the work.

In the evenings I workout and read a non-fiction book to improve myself. In the last two weeks I was so tired that I had no energy to workout or do anything. My body was crushed with tiredness and in pain at the end of the day. I tried reading books but my brain was blank and I couldnt retain anything. 

**Doctor and reactions from reddit**

I posted on reddit about it and people told me to visit the doctor. They also told me to tell my boss why I am doing this. How can my boss know that I want a promotion? 

I went to the doctor and she told me that I have to care about my health. If I continue like this I am on my way to a burnout. She told me that I seem frustrated because people dont see my efforts. She said that I should tell my boss how I feel.

So I did. People had told me to bring a list of my achievements to my boss and tell him why I deserve to get a promotion(Which backfired and probably cost me a good increment today).

Two months ago in one of my regular meetings with the boss I told him that I wanted a promotion. I wanted to grow to a managerial role. He told me I was not there yet. He gave me reasons which he repeated today in the performance evaluation.

**Performance review**

So today was my performance review. I was 1000 percent sure that I will get an excellent review. If nothing else I would get a good increment right? I am not getting a promotion but I should atleast get a decent raise. Here is his review in total(He is a good guy. He was never an asshole to me). There were three people there. Me, my boss and the account manager(person responsible for deciding my increment)

Boss: ""So I think lovesprite thinks much higher of himself than I think of him. He thinks he is here(Points very high). But I think he is here(points much much lower). There are other dimensions to how I rate things and not only how much you deliver as an individual. If we talk about work he delivers work on time with good quality. He is doing well. But two months ago we had a meeting which was the most useful meeting we had in the entire year. We found the bottleneck for lovesprite. Personally I dont care if lovesprite is delivering 110 percent of the work. I care more about the performance of the team. He should have a team mindset. He should not care about his performance as an individual. He thinks of himself as a delivering machine. When you have such a high opinion of yourself I think it can be dangerous. I am looking for the correct word but maybe you start to resent your colleagues.""

Account manager: ""So how would you rate him in getting up to speed since starting the job last year?""

Boss: ""I would rate him average in getting up to speed. I didnt hear anything extraordinary about that ""

Account manager: ""How would you rate his technical ability?""

Boss: ""I would not say its extraordinary. I would say its between average and high"".

Account manager: ""How would you rate his participation in the teams?""

Boss: ""I think he participates well in our scrum events. He also does the demos when people dont want to.""

Account manager: ""So if I want to summarize he works well, delivers on time with good quality. He needs to work on his team skills"".

Boss:""Yes. so that is correct. Team is more important for me and he should try to pay attention to that.""

Account manager:""What do you think about lovesprite's ambitions? He wants to be a manager.""

Boss: ""So he should decide if it will make him happy. Two months ago when he came to me about the promotion I asked him why he wanted to do it. He is years away from that promotion but he should ask himself would he be happy seeing other people deliver? A manager delivers very little. There are many other jobs in the career path in a big company. If you dont feel happy with something you shouldnt do it"".

**Reflecting back**

So this was the result of my hard work in last year. Nothing extraordinary just ""average to high"". I was surprised that 90 percent of the conversation was focused on me not being a team player. Never mind that I got ill delivering 70-80 percent of the stuff of the team. Never mind that I got so much stress to make sure that we are ahead of schedule. Never mind that I worked super hard to the point of burning out just so I would get noticed for a promotion. Its all about the team. Till you start performing bad then its about you and you will be fired. 

I am going to work like my colleagues now and the rest of this community. Give my 70 percent to the job and focus on my health. I started getting lots of issues in the last year. My memory has become horrible and I feel stressed and anxious all the time. Focus on yourself first and dont be an idiot like me.",False,esw471,lovesprite,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/esw471/i_am_an_idiot_dont_make_the_same_mistakes_as_me/,39,1

264,"My soul crushing experience, how I became antiwork","I was software developer for a large multi billion dollar company for about 7 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I completed a project as the sole developer responsible for bringing in $560,000 in revenue. I  worked alone, half of my weekends, and averaging 60 hours per week while working on other projects. I inquired about a raise. I was currently paid $50,000 a year. I was told they can only bump it to $52,000. My coworker is very cool. She shared her salary to make sure I was getting paid right. Despite my coworker being newer less experienced and having less workload, she got paid $65,000. I was told I couldn't bring up salary until next review months away. During my time, I trained three different people. Every 6 months, they post a list of promotion. I noticed that all of the coworker I trained were promoted. I still had the Junior title while they were Seniors.

The mass layoffs happened. 70% of our department, gone. My coworker was 8 months pregnant and got laid off. She got denied COBRA insurance to cover the birth of her child.

They put me on a ""project of my lifetime"". A $15+ million software contract with a firm to convert their old Fortran w/ db/2 system into a .NET w/ SQL Sever system. The system reads documents, processes, and sends the info out to banks. It was necessary for their business upkeep. They only gave us 4 months to implement it. It was the worst 4 months in my life. Let me count the ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. They only hired 3 developers (including me), 2 QA, and 1 manager. The complexity of the project required at least 8 developers. I was the main developer since I started the project a month after the other two developers.
2. We complained to PM and PM's boss that we needed more people. We told them that the go live wouldn't be possible with just three developers. They just shrugged their shoulders and said ""we got to make do with what we got"".
3. One of the new requirements was to make the system read HANDWRITTEN info on the documents with 90% accuracy. This wasn't in the old system and apparently was a major selling point to win the contract. We used some questionable commercial .NET library with licenses they had on ice. It failed miserably and we were just told to ""fix it"".
4. They forgot to include the client's responsibility for doing some of the IT work. The client barely did any of this work and held us responsible for creating the databases, installing software, setting up the environments, and the whole 9 yards. Us 3 were expected also do all of that on top of writing code. 
5. Hours typically were 7 AM to 11 PM 7 days a week. In the last month it was 5 AM to 11 PM 7 days a week. PM designated 1 hour of, and I shit you not, ""family time"". 
6. During final month, PM sent ""wake up"" calls at around 5 AM where I was to wake up and monitor the test system and make sure test system was processing normally. Then send a report.
7. Travel each month. PM wanted itineraries so he will know exactly what times we will be available. Company is infamous for being late paying back expenses. I had a $900 expense that took 2 months to pay back.
8.  Company provided no version control server or CI for the project. We couldn't use a public repo for obvious reasons.
9. Company was stupidly stingy on equipment. Laptops were early gen i5, 8 GB, and 5200 RPM hard drive with piss poor battery life. The much better computers were reserved for managers who only used it for word, excel, and browser. Company don't provide remote test VMs and expect devs to run test VMs on your own machine using shady unverified windows OS passed around in network drives.
10. One of my coworkers' sister had a wedding. He had this on his calendar months in advance. Despite working a few hours on the wedding day, he was chewed out for not being fully available. This was on a Saturday.
11. That same coworker was out for a day because he fell so sick he had to go to the emergency room. He was prescribed some medication that made him drowsy and MIA for most of the day. The PM was extremely angry bitching about him to me on the phone. He went silent after he was told about it.
12. The other coworker, a much older guy and one of the nicest person I have met, was frustrated by the lack of resources. He noticed a guy on bench (waiting to work on the project) with the experience. He tried to recruit him to work with us. The PM found out. Yelled at him in front of everyone for ""doing her job for her"". Brought him into the conference room and threaten his performance reviews tied to raises.
13. This happened nearly every other day... PM calls me and ask to do X feature and to release next day. I told him that it will much longer than a day. Than he says, ""that's not acceptable, it needs to be next day."". We go back and forth. I warned him that it will likely be broken because it's rushed. So I rushed the feature. It breaks in several places. \*surprise pikachu face\* ""WHY IS IT NOT WORKING!!!"".
14. Nearly every day when I was on client site, we worked in a conference room. PM told us we couldn't leave until we push out a new build which is usually super late at night. 
15. I was yelled at in front of everyone because I was 10 minutes late to an impromptu phone call. I was showering.
16. Product was broken since we were tired, pissed, overworked, and understaffed. Clients saw the broken product. What did the PM do? Tell the client it's just a fluke and then tell the two testers to manually modify the data so that it appears working.
17. PM did have a plan if release goes sideways ( which it surely will) and if clients extends the contract. It's called ""give up our thanksgiving, christmas, and new years vacation days"" to work on it.

About a month in, I see the writing on the wall. I needed an exit plan. I started interviewing for other positions. I had four interviews that I was able to pass along as ""doctor's appointment"". I failed each one miserably. Interviewing while deprived is no bueno. 

After the second month, I cried every day. I wanted to quit. My mother had severe medical issues that left her in constant pain. I had to take care of her needs and work was barely paying the bills already. I was losing a lot of money because while I was away, I had to have food and necessities delivered since she was unable to drive and rest of our family didn't give a fuck about me and my mother. I was unable to expense that for reimbursement. 

 I remember arriving to my hotel room at 10 PM, with dozens and dozens of missed calls, missed texts, and emails. I was seriously considering hanging myself in the closet to end all of the suffering. If I was dead, I didn't have to drag myself out of bed still half asleep at 5 AM or put up with my boss's constant complaining. That led me to my decision to put in my two weeks in right there without a job lined up. 

After I put in my two weeks in, the PM and the PM's boss decided to be nice offering gift cards and free meals. They asked me, at the very least, to work an extra week, I refused. I was scheduled to travel my final week, I said no because I had an interview lined up that week. A load was lifted off my back.

Into month four and it's time to release the product to production. The product was unfinished, broken, and absolutely not ready for prime time. We had a final intervention with the PM. He said ""we're going live whether we like it or not"".

Release time. We push the build to production. It was slow, clunky, and put together with gum duct tape and spit. Not acceptable to the client and the testers couldn't fix data in the backend fast enough. Client threatened to sue. PM calls EVERYONE to book a flight immediately. 

The company I worked for has what they call a ""SWAT team"" . When things get rough, they call in a bunch of senior developers and managers to rectify the situation. 

I had to work with one of them on my final week. He was a guy who went to the US from Bangladesh on a visa. He told me, sounded like he was about to cry, that if he don't fix this then they will revoke his visa and send him back to Bangladesh.

269,I. Do. Not. Want. To. Work.,"This is a bit of a rant, sorry. It’s not very well written and I appreciate it might come across as teenage and whiny in comparison to some of the content on here, but that’s not the intention. My brain is just all over the place at the moment.

I don’t want to work. I don’t want a job, or a “career” of any kind. I have no interest in it, and I genuinely don’t believe prostituting your time, soul and personality is the only way to obtain these completely arbitrary rationing tokens known as “money” which the capitalists and landowners have made sure are the only option for survival in this system none of us asked to be born into.

Sadly I know what people’s responses are going to be before I’ve even finished this post - “nobody wants to work, but everyone has to, kiddo, it’s just a fact of life. you need to bite the bullet and ride it out”, which is all very well and good, except I don’t want to, simple as that. This life is not good for us, it’s totally unnatural. we’re supposed to be nomadic hunter-gatherers and such.

tl dr, doing shit that’s either back breaking, soul crushing or entirely pointless for the sake of being able to go “home” (whatever that means), eat sleep repeat,  ie “sit in front of bad screen all day so I can afford to sit in front of good screen all night” is NOT NORMAL. more people need to wake up to this and just fucking set everything on fire.

274,I want to tell you guys what I've been doing for the last 6 or 7 years. Working for an employer that gets it.,"Just want to start by saying in no way is this bragging or rubbing anything in. I just want to share my story of how I have been living since I was ~21. I just found this sub in which I share the sentiments exactly and I was lucky enough to find an employer who does as well. Without revealing exactly what I do or where I work, I just wanted to post this as proof that a business can be profitable and successful, while paying employees a livable wage and treating people like actual human beings.

Sorry about how long and ramble-y this will be but here we go...

I never had a job interview to work where I do, in fact I never even gave them a resume. I met my employer at a bar and he was like ""hey you seem to know some things, you want a job?"" and that was literally it. I fucking hate writing resumes and bullshitting my way through a cover letter just to make it look like I actually want to work where ever it is, so skipping that whole soul destroying process was a dream, I agreed immediately. I was studying software engineering at the time because I thought I should ""get a real job"" after playing music for years and ended up dropping out a month after I got this job.

I work 4 shifts a week, 3 weeknights and one on the weekend during the day. So every day except Saturday I just do what ever I want, go get lunch, go for walks, play xbox, do gardening, write music, what ever, and then go to work when it gets dark. I also still have my Saturday nights free to hang out with my friends who do the normal 9-5 as well.

I get paid for 8 hours even though I don't think I've actually worked that long since the first year I was here and was still learning the ropes. My boss knows this and doesn't give a shit, he has the sentiment of ""well if you're done, you're done, no point of being here"". I've worked out a system where I can do what was originally 8 hours of work in 6 or less, my boss still believes its 8 hours worth of work and just because I'm efficient at it, that doesn't mean I should be paid less. Also if I have to come in to sort something out when I'm not scheduled for what ever reason, even if its only for 5 minutes, that's 3 hours pay for the trouble.

I should also mention, my boss also pays me pretty decently. Like I'm not earning big money, but he could be paying me far less. It's more than enough to pay rent, bills, food and a bunch of leisure time (AKA the pub). As long as the customers are happy and everything is getting done it's cool. He isn't hovering over my shoulder every two seconds, in fact the last time I think I saw him we ran into each other at a music festival (which he also gave me and my girlfriend free tickets to). He works in a different location but it's the same business. I'll send him a text or email if I need anything out of the ordinary and send him an email report every week of whats been going on, which is pretty much fully automated now.

We also have free reign over our schedules. We only really require one or two people to be here at a time, so if me and the other employees want time off we swap shifts around at our own leisure. We do have a sort of unwritten rule that if you take a day off, you have to take a future shift for who ever fills in when ever they ask, but that isn't policy or anything, we just do it. Like I went to Canada for two months once, came back and was filling in for people during football season all the time to make up for the extra time they put in so I could take a holiday. No problem. We all help each other out when it comes to things like this.

Also my boss has a zero tolerance ethic for shitty customers. He says if they cause problems we are doing well enough that they are considered more trouble than what they are worth. We have full permission to tell dickheads to kick rocks, though in the 6 or so years I've been here, that has only ever happened 3 or 4 times.

Now the downsides.

-The strange hours took a while to get used to. My ex hated that most nights during the week I started work pretty much the same time she was finishing and regularly chewed me out for it. My current partner has similar hours to me though so that's all good now, but it was really stressful for a while and I was pretty lonely until I met more people that have similar free time to me, and trust me there isn't many so this took a while lol.

-Having so much free time means I spend way more money on keeping my self entertained than I really should. I have barely any savings, but that's not at the fault of what I'm paid. I just always have to be doing something or else I get antsy and generally that costs money.

And that's really it.

My boss can do all that for us because he isn't greedy and your employer almost certainly can too, they just don't. All the employees where I work live relatively well and get way more time off than the average person. It really is only because our boss isn't obsessed with money. The company is making a profit, he gets his cut, He is happy with his income and isn't interested in making more and through that we get a much more relaxed work environment. I really feel like this is close to how it should be for everyone.

Before I joined, I read a lot of their blog posts and stuff they were posting on social media. It seemed like they were doing good work and doing it properly, to a high standard.

However after joining, it quickly became apparent that it was a shambles. No strategy or processes, employees just left to figure shit out. Hugely over-ambitious plans despite none of the groundwork being done to deliver on those plans. An absolute disaster.

And then what I’m supposed to get a degree to do the same thing in a slightly more skilled position even though it’s just as miserable. I have problems with sobriety and I am almost certain work contributes to my sobriety issues. The level of jobs that I’m qualified for anybody can do on a bunch of pills or stoned as fuck. Every morning when I wake up I seriously consider overdosing or jumping off a cliff instead because it is that fucking awful.

I am absolutely taken aback. They want more work from their employees without properly compensating them. Long story short, I’m quitting ASAP. Fuck that.

There are efforts by select individuals to leave planet earth that require huge economies to maintain the energy, computational, human capital, etc necessary for such a thing to occur

Creation of an AI that will either: Replace humanity, or, will be able to communicate with advanced beings that may or may not visit our planet. Perhaps there is knowledge of a future visitation and the leaders of mankind are in a rush to develop such Babel-tower-esque AI. Imagine ants building a communication device to speak with humans.

Maintenance of a god-like being, a person or creature much more powerful than anybody is allowed to know about. More powerful than any ruler and perhaps requires mass amounts of unknown substance (presumably a substance that requires entire economies to produce) so that it can stay alive.

Creation of wealth for elites

Or is it an emergent network of human greed and hunger that constantly has to innovate and create economic efficiencies  in order to feed an increasing number of mouths with a diminishing warehouse of natural resources.

Are humans becoming like cells, where nature will create a biological entity at a scale much bigger than ourselves, into which we will be subsumed and our free will vanish, replaced by the will of some larger, mechanistic, alien thing (the internet?

When I entered I was passioned about data and it's potential beneficial impact on society. From the moment I entered, my boss assigned me on a yearly project to develop measures for quality assurance on USA's hospitals and clinics (I'm not event american, nor living in the USA). This year people quit and the goals increased and so they asked us to work overtime. They've already paid 80% of my overwork hours from nov-dec 19 (because we didn't hit the target) and they say they're going to pay my overtime hours from jan-march at the end of the project.

I want to quit. But then, I won't get a better job if I have gaps in my resume. I've been applying to other jobs since November and had no interviews yet. I'm not sure if in this career of data science there would be any opportunity to do something more impactful and have a better work-live balance.

378,The Prisoner (Short Story),"\[Op here: I just wrote this short story, heavily inspired by the antiwork subreddit and philosophy, and I thought y'all might be interested, and would be willing to give some feedback. I'd like to know if y'all think the naming gimmick was stupid, or if the message was too heavy handed, or just any critiques in general. If this doesn't fit the type of content allowed on this subreddit that's totally fine. This is my first short story.\]

&amp;#x200B;

The Prisoner wakes up filled with hatred, the same way he does every morning. His hatred is bitter and tinged with regret. If he shared his bed with someone he might have lashed out at them. Who his hatred is targeted at he isn’t sure. After all, he was the one who had set his alarm.

The Prisoner turns off his alarm and lays in bed, gathering the willpower to start the day. Realistically, he knows that the day will start with or without him, but as long as he is still in his bed he can pretend that it won’t. He hates mornings, but he knows everyone else does too, and that comforts him.

After a while his hatred fades into resignation, and the Prisoner leaves his bed to start getting ready. After showering and dressing he goes to his fridge and wonders if he should eat breakfast. After all, he is hungry. He decides against it; eating this early always makes him feel sick. A week ago he had tried eating some eggs and almost vomited. Or maybe it was a month ago. Time blends together when each day is indistinguishable.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Prisoner and his car creep along the congested city street, his eyes occasionally flicking towards the sensor that represents the temperature of the engine. He’s not sure what that sensor is called, but he does know that if it reached the red, he’d be screwed. That had happened to him once on his way to work. He hadn’t even noticed until the engine started making distressing noises. He ended up being an hour late to work that day, and was nearly brought to tears in front of his boss, at the fear of losing his job. That would be the death of me, thinks the Prisoner, his heart twinging at that painful thought. If he lost his job, then - his eyes flick towards the sensor - who knows what would happen to him?

He passes by city hall twice a day, and the mild enjoyment he used to feel at seeing such a beautiful building has quickly faded into indifference. A long time ago, when his life as a working man was just beginning, he would crane his head to catch a glimpse of the lofty lady liberty statue, but now he would just stare at the street ahead, occasionally flicking his eyes towards the sensor. Today though, there is something new to see. A small group of people holding signs, maybe a dozen, are just off the street in front of city hall. One even has a megaphone, and seems to be shouting about something. The group are shaking their signs in agreement while a single police officer stands on the steps regarding them with contempt. The Prisoner wonders what they are all doing outside on a cold winter morning, and on a work day no less!

As he drives, the Prisoner reads some signs, just to find something to think about. Most of the signs have something to do with rich people, or taxes, or something. He’s certain that money is involved. One sign sticks out to him though, because it simply reads “Free Yourself”. The Prisoner finds that extremely odd. Free himself? He is free! What is that sign insinuating? No, he doesn’t like the sign at all, or the woman holding it for that matter. I am free, thinks the Prisoner. More than just free, his life was going great, thank you very much. He has a job that pays the bills, and if he keeps working hard, he might one day be promoted. Sure, there weren’t many developments on the romantic side of things, but who could spare the time to go on dates? Come to think of it, a lot of his interests had fallen to the wayside in the past few years, but what can you expect, being a working man. He used to go camping, he remembered suddenly, and would stare at the stars, far away from the well-lit nights of the city. Things could be much worse for him though. No, the Prisoner reassures himself, I’m very grateful for my lot in life. Those people with the signs are just troublemakers, riling people up over nothing. They should be grateful that things aren’t worse. They should be grateful, like him.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The moment the Prisoner sits at his desk he feels his mind numb and his eyes glaze. That’s a blessing though, it makes the clock go faster. He checks his work email, then his mailbox, and takes stock of his tasks for the day. Nothing out of the ordinary. If he really tried, he could finish it all by lunchtime, but that would present a slew of problems he would rather just avoid. If he finishes his work early, his boss might give him more to do. Nothing important, just time wasting. He might have to reorganize their client files, or digitize some old records. And even if his boss didn’t notice that he wasn’t doing anything, then he would be stuck without anything to do until 5 o’clock. He wouldn’t even be able to check his personal email or read a book, because they were always watching the security cameras and the employees’ screens to catch any time wasters. Having nothing to do was worse than the work. At least when he was working time didn’t warp, turning minutes to hours and hours to lifetimes. Or at least it didn’t warp as much. No, it was better to avoid all that and make his work last the whole day. He wouldn’t want to be a time waster.

As he types, at about half the speed he is capable of, his mind returns to his past. Why hadn’t he gone camping in the past few years? It had made him so happy. Looking up at the endless night sky had always made him feel small, but in a comforting way. Sure, he was insignificant, but he had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the stunning, unending universe! Look! It’s the Milky Way! What more could one want? He was like an ant meeting god. And his friends! Those were the best times of his life, just him and his friends, wasting time in the woods. It’s been years since he’d seen his friends. They’d tried to meet up a few times over the years, but the plans always fell through. It seemed like nobody ever had time anymore. Or maybe nobody had the energy. Or the soul. The Prisoner feels a sense of loss. Anyway, that’s just what happens when you grow up. You start working, you move on to more important things, and you lose touch with old friends. Happens to everybody.

Nearby footsteps bring the Prisoner out of his line of thought. He recognizes them as the short, angry footsteps of his boss; the Warden. 

“Good morning, Warden” says the Prisoner.

“Good morning, Prisoner” says the Warden. “Could we chat for a minute?”

“Sure thing” says the Prisoner, as if he has a choice.

The Warden begins pointing out the various flaws in some report that the Prisoner can’t even remember writing. His paternalistic tone fails to cloak the ever present threat of termination. And it is a threat. If he was fired, chances are he wouldn’t be able to quickly find a job that paid enough for him to keep his apartment. His savings were meager. He would probably be evicted, and then where could he go?

“I’ve talked to you about these kinds of simple mistakes before, Prisoner.” The Warden sighs. “I hate these types of chats. You know, I’m your boss, but I’m also your friend, right?”

“What?” Says the Prisoner, startled out of his thoughts.

“We’re friends right, Prisoner?”

“... yeah of course, Warden.”

“Of course what?”

“...we’re friends.”

“Great! Remember, always give 110% percent. Everyone at this company is family, and you never want to let down your family.”

I hate you, thinks the Prisoner.

“I hear you,” says the Prisoner.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“You know, you shouldn’t let him talk to you like that. For that matter, none of us should let him talk to us like that” says the Dissident, poking at his salad with a plastic fork.

“He’s our boss.”

“So? We’re all adults, why should anyone have the right to talk to us like that? Did you hear how condescending he was? ‘Prisoner, this piece of paper is eggshell white, and I specifically asked for ghost white! One more screw up like this and I might just be forced to terminate you!’” 

The Dissident’s poor impression makes the Prisoner laugh.

“He’s an asshole, but he’s still our boss. Bosses are assholes, it’s like a law of nature.”

“It shouldn’t be. I mean, why is it ok for him to treat us like that? We are the ones who do all the real work in this company. He treats us like we’re prisoners in a camp or something.”

The Dissident’s words remind the Prisoner of the sign he had seen on his commute. He starts to get irritated. The Dissident is his friend, but sometimes it feels like he isn’t grateful to have the job he did. Doesn’t he know things could be a lot worse?

“You’re just being dramatic. We have it good, you know. We live in a free country, and people all over the world have it a lot worse than us.”

“Do you feel free though?”

“What do you mean”

“I mean do you feel like you’re free?”

“I am free,” Says the Prisoner.

“But do you feel like you’re free? Do you enjoy life? Do you spend your days prancing through fields of flowers, just reveling in your freedom?” The Dissident started to get worked up. “No! You spend your days the same as the rest of us, doing pointless bullshit under the thumb of that wannabe tyrant. And when you go home, do you do something you’re passionate about? No! You go back to your crappy apartment, watch TV and wait for the next day to start, because you’re too goddamn burned out to do anything you love, just like the rest of us.” The Dissident stands up like he’s giving a speech, although nobody else in the break room is listening. “What good does it do to live in a free country if we all live bland, passionless lives?”

“Shut the hell up!” Hisses the Prisoner. It doesn’t seem like anybody is listening, but if somebody reported the Dissident’s behavior to the Warden, they would both be in big trouble. You can’t just going around saying anything you want like that! Some opinions have to be kept secret, for your own safety. Besides, the Dissident is pissing him off. Doesn’t he know that he should be grateful?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Prisoner had finally left work, and was driving home. He wasn’t feeling the relief that he normally did when the day was over though, he couldn’t stop thinking about what the Dissident had said. Doesn’t he know that there is no point in trying to change things? People have to work if they want to live. And if you want to work, you have to do whatever your boss says with a smile, and that is just the way things are. And if you work harder than everybody else, the Prisoner tells himself, then one day they’ll recognize that and you’ll be rewarded. That’s how the world works. His eyes flick towards the sensor.

As he draws closer to city hall, he sees something that fuels his anger. The dozen or so sign holders from the morning had grown into a crowd of at least a hundred, illuminated by street lights. The single contemptuous policeman had become twenty, wearing helmets and holding riot shields. The police are stationed in between the front of city hall and the crowd of protesters. The protesters are moving up the steps and towards the large entrance as a pack. At the back of the crowd, just off the side of the street, he could see the woman from this morning holding the same sign. “Free Yourself”.

The Prisoner feels a surge of rage. Who the fuck does she think she is? He is free! And he is happy! The Prisoner’s sweaty hands clutch the steering wheel, his face twisting with rage. That bitch doesn’t know what she’s talking about. Doesn’t she know that people get what they deserve? Doesn’t she know that things could be much worse? Doesn’t she know that *they* could take away what little we have if we piss them off?

That woman with the sign is just as bad as the Dissident. They should know better than to challenge the people who sign our checks! 

Almost subconsciously, the Prisoner starts to turn his steering wheel towards the object of his rage. Soon he is swerving across lanes at the woman, who has her face turned towards city hall. Within seconds his car would fly over the curb, destroying the woman who dared to imply that the Prisoner was wasting his life.

Free himself. Free himself from what? He has a job, he works hard, and one day they will give him what he deserves. There is nothing wrong with the system, people just want to be given things that they haven’t earned. 

The woman turns around and screams, paralyzed with fear as she sees the car barreling towards her. She drops her sign while one of her friends tries to pull her out of the way. It’s in vain, they won’t be fast enough.

This woman, and the Dissident, they believe the world is unfair. They believe that we’re being taken advantage of. They believe the game is rigged. But that’s not true. It can’t be! If that’s true then that means everything I’ve sacrificed: my friends, my love life, my free time, my happiness... it was all for nothing! *...It was all for nothing...*

At the last second, the Prisoner’s car changes course, narrowly missing the woman. His body is shaking uncontrollably and drenched in a cold sweat.

“What the fuck was I thinking?” The Prisoner says to himself. He starts driving normally again, changing lanes to gain distance from the protesters.

As his nerves slowly steady, he tries to figure out what had come over him. Why had he done that? He could have killed that woman, and himself. He couldn’t quite remember what line of thought had led him to such a drastic course of action. He ponders it for a few moments, then shrugs when he can’t find the memory.

He glances up out of his windshield at the sky. It’s already dark out. Winter days were especially short, and he stayed a few hours late at work, at the request of the Warden. No stars. That’s fine, the Prisoner is a working man. His mind is on more important things.

Is you may know many companies still use credit checks as part of their hiring process. His is to ensure that
the employee can be trusted to make sound financial decisions, has the maturity to manage his/her own financial
affairs, and to show signs of financial distress that might indicate risk of theft or fraud. While we do not conduct
these checks at this time the gist of the check is valid to us.

He have noticed for some time the condition of your vehicle and wanted to discuss the matter with you. He
will follow up this email with a personal meeting but wanted to document the discussion beforehand.

Since of course your annual salary is known to us and a newer and more appropriate looking vehicle should be
within your financial reach, it is our concern that perhaps you are having a difficult time financially. Frankly the
concern is that if you cannot afford a newer vehicle then either you may be susceptible to fraud or that you are
not responsible for the position you maintain. To be even more frank, it just looks bad.

Please let us know if there is a reason that you have not upgrade your vehicle before now. Of it is a financial
matter then we will need to know the details of the problems you are having. Perhaps it is as simple that you did
not know the concern you are raising. Otherwise please address this situation as quickly as possible. He will be
happy to refer you to dealerships who we have worked with in the past.

ASK Italian fined £ask for misleading
customers with face ‘luxury lobster’

By Clair Schofield

 

ASK italian/has been fined £40,000 for misleading customers by selling a ‘luxury
lobster’ dish that had been artificially favoured.

The restaurant chain’s lobster and king drawn dish was found to be largely made
up of artificially favoured white fish.

Trading Standards discovered that the most expensive dish on the menu at the
chain - Aragosta e Gamberoni - contained only 35 per cent lobster. Another 34 per
cent of the dish was made of white fish, which had been favoured and formed to
look like lobster.

In the menu, the dish was described as “lobster and king pawns in a creamy
tomato sauce, with a hint of chill"". However, the filling was created using a ‘Lobster
Sensations’ product, which arrives pre-packed at the restaurant.

Following the Trading Standards investigation, the dish was removed from venus
in March last year, although the court heard Eheichainihadimadelesimilioniselling
the dish in the six years it was sold.

made £3 million selling the dish in the six years it was sold.

Learned a few months ago that despite my house going up for Sheriff  sale in March because no job, I'm responsible for paying the sewer bill with money I don't have.

And if I don't, the city statute is a fine of $500 *per day* that I'm late. So I can pay that with money I don't have. Bankruptcy and jail are in my future.

But wait, there's more!! 

You cannot discharge fines through bankruptcy. 

As a parallel illustration to who matters in this nation, Trumpy is promoting a hospital price initiative where hospitals must list prices for procedures; the fine if they refuse? $300 per day.

Two points here: *Never* assume a house is a good idea, as it's just another control pressure point, and an albatross that binds you to one location.

397,"(Rant) “Oh, you go into this career you don’t like. The money is so good!”","So I live in a shit country. If you want to get more discouraged with the state of the world, look up any economic stats of Argentina. 

Finding a job here is borderline impossible. And I like **music**. It’s the only thing I can do out of impulse and not a forced responsibility. 

So, I believed the **“work doing what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life”** bullshit and thought I’d find a music-related job. 

My parents were already deeply disappointed. “What a waste”. Fuck that.

Of course there are no music jobs. Shit country. Even if you find one, you’ll be struggling eternally and poor.

**So I mildly compromised** and looked for more targeted-oriented careers related to music, so I wouldn’t put a bullet through my head in the next couple of years working a job completely unrelated to my goals and passion. I go into **audio engineering **, full of promises of jobs after that. 

I don’t like it. It’s bearable, but hey, it’s not what I actually enjoy doing.

Parents are slightly less disappointed I guess because the career has “engineering” in the title. Lol. Fuck that too.

I’d thought it’d be life plan anyway. I could settle for this shit, even if it’s already disappointing.

**Turns out there are no fucking jobs in the field. Not one**

I drop out before wasting more years of my life in something I didn’t even like that much to begin with. For the US readers, college here is mostly free or cheap so the financial aspect wasn’t a mistake. I did waste three years of my life, though. In something that literally gets you nowhere.

Parents and family are more disappointed than ever. Of course. 

Jobless and having dropped out (so out of financial and parental pressure), **I get a QA Analyst job at a software company. Omg FUCK THAT. **I can stand it, but I fucking hate it. At least it’s a part-time job.

I already feel like I’m being trapped into a life I literally don’t want **at all.** And it was all so quick too.

At a family gathering, my aunt mentions how much of a waste of “intelligence” I was going into music and how I should study a career to be a customs broker. *“It’s two years and the pay is so good!”.*

FUCK THAT SO MUCH, OH MY GOD.

I DON'T WANT TO WORK AT A CUSTOMS HOUSE. I didn’t sign up for **ANY** of this shit. Fuck EVERYONE. 

My aunt means well, anyway. It’s just the concept I fucking despise. 

Now I’m tired all the time, working overtime at something I don’t like, struggling with money and too tired to do anything in my free time. On antidepressants as well. 

But what I hate **the MOST** is how QUICKLY my dreams were crushed. It took the “real world” literally TWO YEARS ONLY to FUCK ME OVER SO HARD that I went from aspiring to follow my dreams to essentially be settling for working AT SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRELATED so I can be tired for the REST of my days? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!??!

I MADE SO MANY COMPROMISES too. I barely talked about two in this post to keep it from being eternal but FUCK EVERYTHING. I really tried to **adapt** and made compromises thinking I could achieve a bearable balance but **NO**. It’s either working 9-5 (plus 1:30hs in commute, fuck that too) until you kill yourself or... yeah, that’s the only fucking option.

Once a year we havr to take inventory.
Cound EVERYTHING.
My department is art supply and we have thousands and thousands of small little bits that all need to be counted and documented.



When I started the company deceived me i to thinking they WeRe LikE a FamiLy and NoT lIkE tHe oThEr ComPanIes.
I really believed them.




They're not even a little better...
Not at all.



Instead of closing the shop for ONE DAY, so we can take inventory during that day, they let us come and work a full shift and basically AFTER the shop closes at SEVEN PM, we may start taking inventory.
Instead of closing the shop for example on the statistically weakest day of the year (regarding profit), they make us stay until 2am on a saturday...
The only day where we can use our nights and go out with friends or family.



Generously they announced the rates for our wage, after the shop closes:
First 3 hours u til 10pm: 10€ (few cents more than minimum wage).
The rest of the time: rediculous 12.5€. For some people this even less than what they're making on normal days.



The people who are in charge will spend the day walking around, observing.
Maybe acting like they're working at times, pushing a cart through the shop.
""We're one of you. Expect when it comes to wage... or work... or workinghours... hmmmmm...



I hate this injustustice.
Generally these assholes stack work on us, put us in different departments, we know nothing about when people quit or get fired.
They break us with stress, people are sick all the time but they never learn from their mlstakes.
They dont care.
And why would they?
There is always someone who will work more for cheaper.
We're digging our own graves through our desperation.



Im only about half a year into my apprenticeship, 2.5 years to go. And then I'll dip!
All my colleagues who have been working there for 10 years+ always talk about how times changed, how the job used to be way more relaxed and better overall.
Now its just depressing.



They will try to fool and betray you, take as much from you as they can.

I'm currently on 4 projects but my boss has been prioritizing his favorite one to the point that I'm not *allowed* to work on the other three, and now I'm severely behind on the others. I'm getting a lot of pressure from other consultants and colleagues because they're basically waiting on me to do my part.

Literally the only way to catch up is to work on them between other tasks, at lunch, etc. But every time my boss has caught me working on them he calls me out because I should be spending my time on his favorite one. He scolds me for not focusing on just the one he likes the most. Normally I'd just let it turn into his problem but my reputation is basically on the line if these others aren't just as successful.

444,"I landed a dream job without any effort, but I’ll probably end up losing it...","Basically I applied for a security job at a big company and got a better job because I looked “presentable” at an open hiring event. I was also the only white one in the lobby and have the sneaking suspicion that it might have had something to do with it.

I make $15 an hour just to drive around to different sites at my leisure and ask if they need anything. Sometimes they have uniforms for me to deliver but usually the guy on the shift before me (the person who trained me) takes care of that. I just drive around and watch Netflix or listen to music. I get an hour paid lunch break, but honestly nobody would know if I just sat there in a parking lot all day. 


Here’s the problem. While training the manager and guy training me casually said that the procedure for when there’s a sleeping guard is to take a picture of them and send it to the manager. He’d then fire them.  Tonight,   on my third day alone in the car,  I finally encountered that on my last site (which I’ve heard is a problem site.) I drove up to a security car at this industrial place and inside was a sleeping older woman guard. I knocked on the window and pretended not to notice awkwardly,  and asked her if she needed any uniform stuff, and went on to the guard shack to check on the other ones. (I feel bad for not saying that I wouldn’t report it because she’s probably losing sleep right now). 


I’d totally be fine with just not reporting anything, and that’s what I’m doing,   but I’m worried that the boss will notice the discrepancy between the person who trained me (the other shift) amount of reports and mine. I’m just hoping he won’t notice,  but I don’t know,  the other guy told me he caught 2 guards within the last couple of weeks.",False,erqhk0,RetardedGirlPussy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/erqhk0/i_landed_a_dream_job_without_any_effort_but_ill/,6,1

448,Practical solutions for people compelled by anti-work ideas,"Hello. I just found this sub recently and have found a lot of the ideas here resonating with me, but I've also come across a lot of defeatism and suicidal ideation. 

I wanted to start a thread where we can talk about practical, realistic solutions to the serious problem of *having to work*. 

I will share what I've come across in my own life experience, 14 years of work, research, and so on, but I'm not trying to create a prescription for anyone here. I'd rather start a discussion and see what ideas other people have.

**Standard Early Retirement**
FIRE refers to ""Financial Independence/Retire Early"" 
The most popular strategy for early retirement, because of its perceived low risk, is to amass a large amount of investments such that you can safely withdraw 3% from your nest egg, almost indefinitely. This is the most popular method advocated for in r/financialindependence. Figure out how much you spend in a year, then build up a nest egg such that you can cover your living expenses indefinitely. 

Or, you can create ""passive income,"" which is income that one does not need to actively create through labor. There are some debates about what this means. Some people consider buying investment properties to be passive income, though of course there is a lot of labor and work involved with being a landlord, unless you pass off your properties to a property management company. Even then, there is work involved, like paying taxes, overseeing the higher-level context of your real estate portfolio, etc. 

There is also a strong community in r/leanfire who are approaching the issues of r/financialindependence by looking to retire early with a smaller amount of money, such as saving up $300k and drawing the 3%, or using super-low-cost-of-living arbitrage strategies by moving to countries or geographic locations with very low expenses. For example, there are places even in the U.S. where a person can buy a house for $25k in decent shape in rural places. 

**Passive Income** 
As aforementioned, passive income generally refers to the automatic generation of capital that doesn't require labor. There are quite a few ways to set up passive income or semi-passive income, all of which are fairly difficult and time-intensive, can be risky, and don't have guaranteed incomes (few things in life have guaranteed outcomes, anyway, but...):
* Real estate
* Entrepreneurship (starting a business)
* Social media strategies, like running ads on a YouTube channel
* I don't know. I'm sure there are a lot more. Marrying into money, or something like that. Cryptocurrencies and speculation. Etc. 

**Alternative Work Styles**
While this still includes work, there are lots of alternatives to the corporate 8-5 hellscape. This includes things like remote digital work (like the Digital Nomadism movement), seasonal work, finding a career with serious vacations (like teaching), becoming a freelancer or independent consultant, and so on. All of this requires work, but gives the individual a little more independence and autonomy. 

**Alternative Living Styles**
Things like van living, WWOFing (I don't know if people still call it this, it's basically working on a farm in a commune in exchange for food and board, which sounds awful to me, but it's something, if you're healthy and like being outdoors), extreme minimalism, ""freegan"" or hobo-style living, ""How to Drop Out"" ideas by Ran Prieur, becoming a monk. Feel free to add. 

**Finding a Job You Love**
This is probably a myth and is steeped in capitalist ideology. But perhaps you could find employment that either does not make you want to drop off the face of the planet. With some self-searching and finding a job that matches well with your psychological disposition, you could potentially find a position that is significantly less awful than what you are experiencing with your job now. For me, this meant switching from corporate-nightmare-land to academia, which is better suited to my psyche. 

**General Personal Finance**
It doesn't solve the systemic issues of having to work or the evils of global capitalism, but learning how to budget and live on less than you earn can certainly help your mental health (reduced stress, reduced anxiety) and can help move you in a direction toward the financial necessity of needing to work, such as giving you the freedom to start a business or buy real estate with savings. From what I've read in survey data, about 50% of Americans are only a $300 emergency away from bankruptcy. This one is highly debated. Obviously people need to be paid more. But people can also complete training and try to improve their position, within reason. Either way, educating yourself generally in personal finance can help with the pain of having to work daily, and is probably the starting point for most people to create an escape route. 

That's about all I have for now. I hope some other people will chime in with their ideas or strategies about their practical solutions for not having to work, as it seems like it would benefit the sub and would give us something to talk about today.

""You can't get called back into an office, you're making up bullshit."" - in response to my friend saying they called him back there to talk about calling out on an app instead of the store

""You're a fucking man, if you can't handle a customer throwing something at you you're just not gonna make it in life."" - a customer threw a tray of food at my friend and got rewarded extra food for rude/violent behavior

""I knew you were lying about trying to work when you said you had to go on the internet to put in for the job"" - my friend told him they didn't do paper/in store applications.

""No you can go to the doctor because you had insurance with work."" - he thinks all jobs have full insurance because he saw a commercial, we still don't know what commercial he's talking about.

""You should have asked your boss to borrow gas money for the doctor then."" - he honestly thinks his boss would have gave him money to go to the doctor for some reason.

My friend said you couldn't eat food at work without paying for it and his dad said ""That's not true, Kimmy used to get to bring home pizza when she worked at the gas station.""

My friend is wanting to find another job, but he's wanting to wait until he gets a cyst removed from his arm before he starts because it would be easier than getting hired on then immediately requesting off.

453,How do we get humans not to think about themselves first?,"Every fuck is trying to get ahead, get the promotion, get the nice salaried job. As long as humans continue to think like monkeys looking to conquer and replicate wtf can we do? We talk about a revolution, big government change, a working class uproar rioting through cities demanding change but how will we see change?

I couldn't talk to someone in real life about 99% of the ideas on this sub, I'd be dismissed or laughed at. ""What? You don't want to work and provide for yourself? You lazy bum! Go out and get a job! You've been doing nothing!"" If I tried challenging this view I'd be sent to the shadow realms, this is the only thing that matters. Like my life is worth more than the employer I slave for, how could I be so naive.

So working at a car dealership upselling some schmuck is providing value in this world? Selling some vitamin to a middle aged woman promising her rejuvenation and youth is morally righteous? Dont get me started on part-time retail jobs, all I need are two of those and I can pay for rent, food, and water meanwhile my debt and student loans will be there and multiply.

455,The Prisoner (Short Story),"\[OP here: I wrote this short story heavily influenced by the antiwork subreddit and philosophy, and I thought y'all might be interested, and might be willing to give some feedback. I'd like to know if y'all think the naming gimmick was stupid, or if the message was too heavy handed. If this doesn't fit the type of content that this subreddit allows, that's totally fine. This is my first ever short story.\]

&amp;#x200B;

The Prisoner wakes up filled with hatred, the same way he does every morning. His hatred is bitter and tinged with regret. If he shared his bed with someone he might have lashed out at them. Who his hatred is targeted at he isn’t sure. After all, he was the one who had set his alarm.

The Prisoner turns off his alarm and lays in bed, gathering the willpower to start the day. Realistically, he knows that the day will start with or without him, but as long as he is still in his bed he can pretend that it won’t. He hates mornings, but he knows everyone else does too, and that comforts him.

After a while his hatred fades into resignation, and the Prisoner leaves his bed to start getting ready. After showering and dressing he goes to his fridge and wonders if he should eat breakfast. After all, he is hungry. He decides against it; eating this early always makes him feel sick. A week ago he had tried eating some eggs and almost vomited. Or maybe it was a month ago. Time blends together when each day is indistinguishable.

The Prisoner and his car creep along the congested city street, his eyes occasionally flicking towards the sensor that represents the temperature of the engine. He’s not sure what that sensor is called, but he does know that if it reached the red, he’d be screwed. That had happened to him once on his way to work. He hadn’t even noticed until the engine started making distressing noises. He ended up being an hour late to work that day, and was nearly brought to tears in front of his boss, at the fear of losing his job. That would be the death of me, thinks the Prisoner, his heart twinging at that painful thought. If he lost his job, then - his eyes flick towards the sensor - who knows what would happen to him?

He passes by city hall twice a day, and the mild enjoyment he used to feel at seeing such a beautiful building has quickly faded into indifference. A long time ago, when his life as a working man was just beginning, he would crane his head to catch a glimpse of the lofty lady liberty statue, but now he would just stare at the street ahead, occasionally flicking his eyes towards the sensor. Today though, there is something new to see. A small group of people holding signs, maybe a dozen, are just off the street in front of city hall. One even has a megaphone, and seems to be shouting about something. The group are shaking their signs in agreement while a single police officer stands on the steps regarding them with contempt. The Prisoner wonders what they are all doing outside on a cold winter morning, and on a work day no less!

As he drives, the Prisoner reads some signs, just to find something to think about. Most of the signs have something to do with rich people, or taxes, or something. He’s certain that money is involved. One sign sticks out to him though, because it simply reads “Free Yourself”. The Prisoner finds that extremely odd. Free himself? He is free! What is that sign insinuating? No, he doesn’t like the sign at all, or the woman holding it for that matter. I am free, thinks the Prisoner. More than just free, his life was going great, thank you very much. He has a job that pays the bills, and if he keeps working hard, he might one day be promoted. Sure, there weren’t many developments on the romantic side of things, but who could spare the time to go on dates? Come to think of it, a lot of his interests had fallen to the wayside in the past few years, but what can you expect, being a working man. He used to go camping, he remembered suddenly, and would stare at the stars, far away from the well-lit nights of the city. Things could be much worse for him though. No, the Prisoner reassures himself, I’m very grateful for my lot in life. Those people with the signs are just troublemakers, riling people up over nothing. They should be grateful that things aren’t worse. They should be grateful, like him.

The moment the Prisoner sits at his desk he feels his mind numb and his eyes glaze. That’s a blessing though, it makes the clock go faster. He checks his work email, then his mailbox, and takes stock of his tasks for the day. Nothing out of the ordinary. If he really tried, he could finish it all by lunchtime, but that would present a slew of problems he would rather just avoid. If he finishes his work early, his boss might give him more to do. Nothing important, just time wasting. He might have to reorganize their client files, or digitize some old records. And even if his boss didn’t notice that he wasn’t doing anything, then he would be stuck without anything to do until 5 o’clock. He wouldn’t even be able to check his personal email or read a book, because they were always watching the security cameras and the employees’ screens to catch any time wasters. Having nothing to do was worse than the work. At least when he was working time didn’t warp, turning minutes to hours and hours to lifetimes. Or at least it didn’t warp as much. No, it was better to avoid all that and make his work last the whole day. He wouldn’t want to be a time waster.

As he types, at about half the speed he is capable of, his mind returns to his past. Why hadn’t he gone camping in the past few years? It had made him so happy. Looking up at the endless night sky had always made him feel small, but in a comforting way. Sure, he was insignificant, but he had the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the stunning, unending universe! Look! It’s the Milky Way! What more could one want? He was like an ant meeting god. And his friends! Those were the best times of his life, just him and his friends, wasting time in the woods. It’s been years since he’d seen his friends. They’d tried to meet up a few times over the years, but the plans always fell through. It seemed like nobody ever had time anymore. Or maybe nobody had the energy. Or the soul. The Prisoner feels a sense of loss. Anyway, that’s just what happens when you grow up. You start working, you move on to more important things, and you lose touch with old friends. Happens to everybody.

Nearby footsteps bring the Prisoner out of his line of thought. He recognizes them as the short, angry footsteps of his boss; the Warden.

“Good morning, Warden” says the Prisoner.

“Good morning, Prisoner” says the Warden. “Could we chat for a minute?”

“Sure thing” says the Prisoner, as if he has a choice.

The Warden begins pointing out the various flaws in some report that the Prisoner can’t even remember writing. His paternalistic tone fails to cloak the ever present threat of termination. And it is a threat. If he was fired, chances are he wouldn’t be able to quickly find a job that paid enough for him to keep his apartment. His savings were meager. He would probably be evicted, and then where could he go?

“I’ve talked to you about these kinds of simple mistakes before, Prisoner.” The Warden sighs. “I hate these types of chats. You know, I’m your boss, but I’m also your friend, right?”

“What?” Says the Prisoner, startled out of his thoughts.

“We’re friends right, Prisoner?”

“... yeah of course, Warden.”

“Of course what?”

“...we’re friends.”

“Great! Remember, always give 110% percent. Everyone at this company is family, and you never want to let down your family.”

I hate you, thinks the Prisoner.

“I hear you,” says the Prisoner.

“You know, you shouldn’t let him talk to you like that. For that matter, none of us should let him talk to us like that” says the Dissident, poking at his salad with a plastic fork.

“He’s our boss.”

“So? We’re all adults, why should anyone have the right to talk to us like that? Did you hear how condescending he was? ‘Prisoner, this piece of paper is eggshell white, and I specifically asked for ghost white! One more screw up like this and I might just be forced to terminate you!’”

The Dissident’s poor impression makes the Prisoner laugh.

“He’s an asshole, but he’s still our boss. Bosses are assholes, it’s like a law of nature.”

“It shouldn’t be. I mean, why is it ok for him to treat us like that? We are the ones who do all the real work in this company. He treats us like we’re prisoners in a camp or something.”

The Dissident’s words remind the Prisoner of the sign he had seen on his commute. He starts to get irritated. The Dissident is his friend, but sometimes it feels like he isn’t grateful to have the job he did. Doesn’t he know things could be a lot worse?

“You’re just being dramatic. We have it good, you know. We live in a free country, and people all over the world have it a lot worse than us.”

“Do you feel free though?”

“What do you mean”

“I mean do you feel like you’re free?”

“I am free,” Says the Prisoner.

“But do you feel like you’re free? Do you enjoy life? Do you spend your days prancing through fields of flowers, just reveling in your freedom?” The Dissident started to get worked up. “No! You spend your days the same as the rest of us, doing pointless bullshit under the thumb of that wannabe tyrant. And when you go home, do you do something you’re passionate about? No! You go back to your crappy apartment, watch TV and wait for the next day to start, because you’re too goddamn burned out to do anything you love, just like the rest of us.” The Dissident stands up like he’s giving a speech, although nobody else in the break room is listening. “What good does it do to live in a free country if we all live bland, passionless lives?”

“Shut the hell up!” Hisses the Prisoner. It doesn’t seem like anybody is listening, but if somebody reported the Dissident’s behavior to the Warden, they would both be in big trouble. You can’t just going around saying anything you want like that! Some opinions have to be kept secret, for your own safety. Besides, the Dissident is pissing him off. Doesn’t he know that he should be grateful?

The Prisoner had finally left work, and was driving home. He wasn’t feeling the relief that he normally did when the day was over though, he couldn’t stop thinking about what the Dissident had said. Doesn’t he know that there is no point in trying to change things? People have to work if they want to live. And if you want to work, you have to do whatever your boss says with a smile, and that is just the way things are. And if you work harder than everybody else, the Prisoner tells himself, then one day they’ll recognize that and you’ll be rewarded. That’s how the world works. His eyes flick towards the sensor.

As he draws closer to city hall, he sees something that fuels his anger. The dozen or so sign holders from the morning had grown into a crowd of at least a hundred, illuminated by street lights. The single contemptuous policeman had become twenty, wearing helmets and holding riot shields. The police are stationed in between the front of city hall and the crowd of protesters. The protesters are moving up the steps and towards the large entrance as a pack. At the back of the crowd, just off the side of the street, he could see the woman from this morning holding the same sign. “Free Yourself”.

The Prisoner feels a surge of rage. Who the fuck does she think she is? He is free! And he is happy! The Prisoner’s sweaty hands clutch the steering wheel, his face twisting with rage. That bitch doesn’t know what she’s talking about. Doesn’t she know that people get what they deserve? Doesn’t she know that things could be much worse? Doesn’t she know that *they* could take away what little we have if we piss them off?

That woman with the sign is just as bad as the Dissident. They should know better than to challenge the people who sign our checks!

Almost subconsciously, the Prisoner starts to turn his steering wheel towards the object of his rage. Soon he is swerving across lanes at the woman, who has her face turned towards city hall. Within seconds his car would fly over the curb, destroying the woman who dared to imply that the Prisoner was wasting his life.

Free himself. Free himself from what? He has a job, he works hard, and one day they will give him what he deserves. There is nothing wrong with the system, people just want to be given things that they haven’t earned.

The woman turns around and screams, paralyzed with fear as she sees the car barreling towards her. She drops her sign while one of her friends tries to pull her out of the way. It’s in vain, they won’t be fast enough.

This woman, and the Dissident, they believe the world is unfair. They believe that we’re being taken advantage of. They believe the game is rigged. But that’s not true. It can’t be! If that’s true then that means everything I’ve sacrificed: my friends, my love life, my free time, my happiness... it was all for nothing! *...It was all for nothing...*

At the last second, the Prisoner’s car changes course, narrowly missing the woman. His body is shaking uncontrollably and drenched in a cold sweat.

“What the fuck was I thinking?” The Prisoner says to himself. He starts driving normally again, changing lanes to gain distance from the protesters.

As his nerves slowly steady, he tries to figure out what had come over him. Why had he done that? He could have killed that woman, and himself. He couldn’t quite remember what line of thought had led him to such a drastic course of action. He ponders it for a few moments, then shrugs when he can’t find the memory.

He glances up out of his windshield at the sky. It’s already dark out. Winter days were especially short, and he stayed a few hours late at work, at the request of the Warden. No stars. That’s fine, the Prisoner is a working man. His mind is on more important things.

Everyone does everything for me, they give me food, provide shelter, make my cell warm, and im suppose to pay them with shekels so i can continue doing this same thing over and over and over and over again, till I die, and this is somehow supposed to be a good thing, not to mention fun? 

Do you think a bear would be happy not being out in the wild, hunting deer, hibernating, living with the seasons, but instead in a factory, even at winter, doing some meaningless task where he would be thrown a fish occasionaly? 

Oh and the bear should be thankfull he has a roof over his head, gets food, has his basic neceseties covered. Oh please give me a break. Im so friken pissed atm.

He longer lives in the wild and inhales clean air, hunts deer, and sleeps during the winter. No instead he has to now work, so he can continue living, and then maybe on a saturday or sunday, if he for chance isn't going to be called into work tommorow, can maybe enjoy nature for a few hours, before going back, and doing it all over again.

491,I'm not depressed. It's my lack of freedom.,"So as an mtf, I had to get my letter of diagnosis so I could start hrt. While discussing things with my therapist I started talking about some of my internal thoughts and dialogues.  And as helpful as she has been, she's very set on me getting on antidepressants. This bothers me a lot because I'm very attuned with my inner mind and have spent a lot of time self reflecting.

I know where my depression symptoms come from, and it's the fact that living in this world is like a constant battle. Nearly every part of my day is spent actively going against my 'true nature'.  I dont want a fucking pill that'll alter my brain to be more comfortable with this because its not just me. When I try to defer to google I get stats like,

More than 25million american adults are on antidepressants,

Or 1 in 6 americans are on antidepressants

Or more than a third of american adults are on medication related to depression.

And I'm sure these numbers would be even higher if more people could afford healthcare and were given the chance to try to get help.

But at what point do we stop and think weather there is really that many people with ""chemical imbalances"" in their brains, or maybe its that humans haven't spent the last 300000 years of evolution to exist in this system that we're forced to abide by today? 

I think its the latter.  I know why I'm ""depressed"" and its because I'm terrified of financial instability. Its because the only options I have are:

Work my dangerous hard labor exhausting job for barely decent pay

Work an easier less dangerous and stressful job for worthless pay (probably still way more stressful than necessary)

Or take out impossible to pay off student loans and maybe get the job I want, which would still be barely decent pay.

495,Routines are so boring. How the heck do people do it?,"After being unemployed for extended periods twice over 1.5 years, I managed to land a job that I don't dread. Pay isn't great, but it's a non profit, so I get it. I'm basically a glorified receptionist. Not glamorous, but the environment is chill and the people are quite lovely. 

I can take my break whenever I want, given it's not busy. I work a tasteful 30 hours a week. I can eat at the front desk. There are usually snacks in the kitchen available to all staff. And I work evenings, so my manager isn't around to watch over my shoulder. It's a pretty sweet deal for what it is. 

After quitting my previous job in an emotional flurry, I flew to Argentina for 10 weeks to stay with family. I came back feeling a lot better and was unemployed for about 4-5 months. I decided that I wanted to support the local recreation/arts community, and landed a position in a place that does exactly that. For the first month, I really believed that it could be my forever place. But after entering month 2, I was already searching for an escape.

It's now been 5 months, and every day I dream about grabbing a work visa and ditching this town. I'm planning to fly off somewhere early to mid 2021, but it's taking everything in me not to just bounce ASAP. I guess I'm trying to prove to myself that I can commit to something for longer than a year(?). Also I need to build up my savings as part of many working holiday visa requirements.

I'll be going to Europe for 3 weeks in the summer and possibly Asia next January. It's exciting, but mini vacations leave me with temporary highs that fade after returning to regular, day-to-day life.

Anyways, I don't really know what I'm searching for but, for whatever reason, a stable life doesn't appeal to me at all. I don't understand how people can work at the same place, taking the same commute, doing the same thing day after day, year after year. It's been 5 months and I don't even work full time. My schedule is varied to a degree. I get a decent amount of freedom, yet I'm going stir crazy over here. 

Coming off of a job that made me incredibly depressed, I'm very thankful that my new workplace is more than tolerable, even enjoyable at times. But I still feel so out of  my element, and idk if running off to another country will fix this. 

I guess my questions are: how the heck does a person A) Break free from a mundane routine, or B) Learn to embrace a routine. Also, is living abroad a good solution to someone who is bored of their life and surroundings? Is there anything else I can do in the meantime?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance!",False,erab7j,olaitsjuli,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/erab7j/routines_are_so_boring_how_the_heck_do_people_do/,14,1

503,"Well, this is it.","Hello all. Brace yourselves for a post of venting and a part of my life's story.

I have had a bunch of thoughts lately about life. Maybe this isn't the right place for it, but for me, it seems a better place than any for me to post, or maybe.. Vent? I've never been one to think that I'm depressed or in need of help. I also have a feeling in the back of my mind, that I have to, for whatever reason, justify my lifestyle.

I went through all the normal things like school, work, social life, typical blah blah.. School and work overlapped most towards my Senior year in high school. Since, I was a straight 'F' student.. Literally almost failed everything and was always told I never applied myself, which.. To be completely honest, is absolutely not true. I was hardly ever motivated, I didn't have it in me, I just wanted to get out of there so bad. Especially having been held back my Freshman year, making it a 5 year high school run. 

Moving on from my high school. I had literally NO desire to continue schooling. I also had no idea what I was going to do to survive in adulthood, but for some reason.. I wasn't anxious about it. I really didn't care, and still don't to this day, about ""missing out"" on college. So, I went into retail while still living with my Mom and went from there. After that I got a pharmacy tech job that lasted 7 years, then bought a house at 24 years old. Then went to be a medical technician (Delivered hospital beds, etc.), then a shred-it driver working the downtown city route (nightmare, especially in a decent sized truck.) The money was great, and helping me definitely start paying off some of my debt from spending too much on music gear, lol. 

Something happened though. I feel like I snapped one day. Once, I would NEVER have quit a job without another lined up. Things began to change. While at Shred-it, I started losing it with the 60 hour work weeks and the constant feeling of thinking.. ""Why am I spending my time making this money, and not being able to enjoy it. Oh, wait.. Society expects people to be a drones for 60+ years and then.. ""Have their fun"". From what I can tell. Most people I was around were workaholics, so I'd ask them what they were going to do when they retired.. The depressing thing was, they'd always say they didn't want to. That they'd have no clue what to do if they didn't have WORK to do.

After leaving Shred-it, I left to work closer to my house at a local call center for a pharmaceutical company. I maybe lasted 5 weeks through the training. I overestimated my ability to multitask, and when I finally got on the first 'live' call, it was a nightmare to me. Everything they trained me to do wasn't what the call pertained to. I started feeling immediately overwhelmed and stressed. I felt so trapped because, ""how am I going to pay my bills?!"" I applied to other companies that were WAY less stressful. They would see my resume with 'pharmacy tech', 'med tech', shred-it driver, (not that those are prestigious, just more difficult than regular retail) and tell me that I was ""overqualified"" to work at retail. (I'm legit not bragging, the titles are more prestigious then it sounds).

Here is where I am now though. I landed a job at a health food grocery store. I get in there trying to do my ""be as available and helpful you can be"" to the employer and my peers. Things were fine for a time, met plenty of nice people, and would say I had the best direct boss, I'd ever had. However, certain things wore down over time, like usual, the company starts imposing quotas on things that were ridiculous, and just generally making things worse for employees. (Like I've experienced at all my jobs) I started getting interested in doordash and other gig economy jobs. Did a few, and didn't mind doing it. Fast forward to a few months after I start. I had told my boss to update my schedule since he volunteered me to another store for a day. However, since 3 people had control of my schedule, it never got changed, and me being lazy like I am.. I didn't mark it down either. I woke up to a phone call the day I was suppose to be at the other store.. A 30 minute drive away. Everything flashed before me, my life, my jobs, all the bs... I decided to not answer it and shut it off. I really do feel bad for my former coworkers there, but.. I seriously couldn't take the rat race anymore.. 

Here is where things turn for me, in a good way. I realized that I had to give the gig economy a try at least. So, I did more and more deliveries. Still didn't make enough. I contemplated on selling the house and trying to either 'van life' it or buy an RV to live in. My mom panicked and offered to help me figure things out. So, with the MASSIVE help from my step-father and mother, we renovated a room in my house and turned it into an airbnb. I have been running it for a month now, and have had enough guests to be able to pay my entire monthly mortgage, by itself. Now, I just drive and host. I have literally NEVER in my life been happier. I can be a lazy mofo and not give a damn. I hardly set alarms anymore, I go to sleep randomly. Sometimes I wake up at 11am.. Other days I sleep in til 5pm. (That's right.... 5pm) because that is what I want to do.

How can I pay all my bills just doing food delivery apps and guest hosting apps? I keep my stuff as low as I can. I NEVER want to have kids (nothing against them, just not for me), I NEVER want to get married, and I am pretty sure I bought my house in a ""buyer's"" market. My brother is a Project Manager for at a major company and can't even afford homes where I live now. You know why? He chose to get married, chose to get a degree, and when the marriage didn't work out because she wanted to talk to some other dudes, they had to sell the house they JUST bought, taking a massive hit.

My point is.. I didn't go to college, I live the mid-west (low cost of living), no kids, no wife, I live in my own basement (partially finished), play video games, smoke weed, watch dumbass shows, play guitar, record music, deliver food on the time of my own choosing. I honestly feel like I am retired now in a weird way. I will have walked away from all this owning a small business, being my own boss, no debt other than my mortgage, paid off car, I own everything I really even ever wanted. Every day still, I always have this feeling that I am... ""Getting away"" with something.. Like, I am breaking the law or something. I honestly believe that this is all the things that society has told me, lingering in my head. Hopefully it will go away one day, and I can fully embrace leaving the rat race.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Kept costs low, bought a house with the money I saved from working at $13 an hour for 7 years \*\*(in a buyer's market in the mid-west)\*\*, no wife, no kids, only debt is from the mortgage, now I am using a room in the house to basically finance my entire mortgage.

508,How To STOP WORKING FOREVER IMMEDIATELY With The Freedom Dividend.,"I posted this in the official Andrew Yang subreddit, and although this is a different subreddit, I wanted to get other thoughts about this too. This is a thought experiment I think is viable enough that I will try it out with four or five buddies that I have, if Andrew Yang is elected president.

Andrew Yang's campaign revolves most centrally around implementing UBI, or the ""Freedom Dividend"" as he calls it of 1000 dollars a month for everyone in the United States over age 18. Now, I'm sure that this policy is great for bringing everyone up to just under the poverty limit, and he believes that it will still encourage people to work to financially better themselves. He does reference various studies regarding hours worked with or without UBI (and it shows that there is little to no difference), but I can rebuttal against these fairly easily with these arguments: 1. The people who were given UBI knew that it was a limited time ordeal, and not guaranteed over an entire lifetime. They had to continue to work in order to financially support themselves after the UBI trial was over. 2. There haven't been any UBI trials done with an entire country, meaning that all of the inhabitants of that country receive a UBI. If this was the case, I am almost certain there would be a good number of people who also thought about doing what I am about to describe, and would be able to never work another day in there lives (given that the UBI is a lifetime guarantee). Onto the step - by - step process.

Step 1. Gather 4+ buddies together. You need people that you can trust, you can even live with a special other, and invite another couple to get to 4 total people with 18+ years of age.

Step 2. Look for an apartment with 2+ bedrooms. Depending on who you are living with (buddies / special other / another couple), the number of bedrooms may vary. I found multiple listings for 4 bedroom apartments for up to 2000 dollars, with most being around the 1000 dollar to 1500 dollar range in my area.

Step 3. Pool all of your money together and do some budgeting. The more people involved in this method, the less budgeting you will need to do. It all depends on the goals of the group. For instance, if I had 4 buddies together, we would receive a collective 4000 dollars a month. Using a 4 bedroom apartment at 1500 dollars a month as a example, we would be left with 2500 dollars. Factoring in food expenses and most other amenities, take off an additional 750 dollars a month, leaving us with 1750 dollars a month to do whatever we want with. I would personally invest it somewhere to grow it safely, probably in an index fund, but I could just as well spend all month partying with my buddies or playing video games, I never need to work again. If, for example, I don't like my buddies all that well, we can live separately as with most of the houses I examined the bedrooms were separated off from each other. No need to interact with each other if we don't particularly enjoy each other's company for whatever reason. Again, this method works better with more people. For instance, instead of 4 buddies, I could have 8. An 8 bedroom apartment I found in my area costs 3000 dollars a month. 8 buddies get a total of 8000 dollars a month with the Freedom Dividend, so after rent we are left with 5000 dollars a month. Factoring in food and other amenities and we are left with 3500 dollars a month to do whatever we want to with, no need to work. More people in a group - more overall savings, more overall savings - more potential growth through investments. 3500 dollars a month invested well can quickly make a fortune. So not only do you not need to work or do anything economically productive at all, you are potentially also getting significantly richer through investments and whatever compounding interest you do.

Again, this may be viable for a specific group of people. I, for one, absolutely hate working, and if I had the chance (like the one Andrew Yang is giving me), I would quit immediately, and no amount of money offered to me would change my mind. The fact that I am also very frugal and generally anti - materialism / consumerism only helps me in this scenario. I am wondering if anyone else plans to do this on this subreddit like I am if Andrew Yang is elected president and passes the Freedom Dividend.

520,Excellent succinct summation of the last 40 years of corporate and CEO/Elite treason,"[Link](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2019/08/resurrecting-american-economy.html)

Donald Trump has recently ordered US corporations to move production out of China and into the US. Easier said than done!—or, rather, undone. Moving production to China (and, in case of IT, to India) allowed US corporations to benefit from the large wage differential and an easier regulatory environment in order to be more profitable. They spent these excess profits by buying back their own stock, paying generous dividends to their shareholders and using their artificially inflated stock prices to justify exorbitant executive salaries and bonuses.

Along the way, they impoverished American workers by depriving them of gainful deployment, eroded the skill base of the American population and, perhaps most importantly, destroyed demand for their products because more and more Americans could no longer afford them. As these trends played out, making China prosperous and the US increasingly distressed and impoverished, with close to 100 million working-age people permanently jobless, US corporations could no longer profit from their offshored production to the same extent, and so they took advantage of low interest rates to borrow huge sums of money and use it to continue buying back their own shares, paying dividends and continuing with the exorbitant executive compensation.

By now, many of the major US corporations are financial zombies, waiting for an uptick in interest rates to drive them into bankruptcy. And it is these zombies that are being tasked with bringing production back to the US. Good luck with that! Which is to say, it is highly unlikely that such an effort could possibly succeed. But even if it could succeed, would it solve the problem—which is that the US is gradually degenerating into a bankrupt third world country? Perhaps not, because, you see, the entire theory of “making America great again” is based on a fallacy—which is that China became the world’s largest economy (by purchasing power) and the world’s factory simply by virtue of the fact that American corporations offshored production to it.",False,er0eml,SleepNowMyThrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/er0eml/excellent_succinct_summation_of_the_last_40_years/,0,1

524,Here's a story from my retail days that I think you'll enjoy: The time I organized a worker's revolt and won.,"When I was younger, I worked as an assistant manager for a local outlet of a large sporting goods company. Once a year, we would have a week-long sidewalk sale, and it was a gruelling week. Shifts started at 7am and ended past 11pm. To save money, the district sales manager hired the minimum amount of staff and paid them minimum wages, plus it was August so it was hot and humid outside, which is where we spent the bulk of the day.

So here's the first kicker, as an assistant manager, I was under contract. So despite working 75+ hours in one week, I was only getting paid my normal wages. The part-time hires were forced to leave their day early to avoid overtime, so at the end of every day it was just me and the manager and our third key. We were all miserable and exhausted. (for the record, the manager and third key were both ""work until you die"" types and constantly complained that the young part-timers were lazy, which was not true at all). 

However, the long, shitty week was due to end on labour day, which is a national holiday and a much needed day off. Everyone was looking forward to it. The weekend before, the big boss came to see how things were doing, and he inquired about how much it would cost to pay the fines for being open on a holiday versus the money we would make in sales. The fine was a laughable amount, so mister big boss decided that we would be working that day instead.

When I was told this news, I almost became delirious. And I made a decision that I still congratulate myself for today. Despite the entire staff being told that we will be open, I quietly went to every single part time employee (their average age was 16, I was 18) and told them that there was a change in plans and that in reality we would be closed. I made it clear that tomorrow morning they could stay in bed and spend the day with their families. They were a little suspicious but I reassured them saying ""if they call you, tell them i gave you the day off and that you won't be coming in because you made plans with your family"", also ""they aren't going to fire all of you, just me"".

Come Monday, nobody showed up including yours truly. Around 8:30am I got a panicked call from my douchebag sales manager asking whether or not it was true that I gave everyone the day off. I said yes, and that I wasn't planning on showing up either. I was promptly fired, but they had to cancel the day because they were only four employees.

535,The managerial/owner classes and “free stuff” (Semi-rant),"Back in September, I, along with two others from my department at work, were unceremoniously transferred to a different department. At the time, management explained that there was not enough demand for work in our department to justify our staying on - this despite the fact that there was never a shortage of work to go around.

As the departmental move allowed me to work from home, I semi-reluctantly accepted the new position.

Fast-forward to today, when I receive an email from my old boss. Because my old department is now horrendously understaffed - and who could have ever predicted that, am I right? - I’m now expected to pitch in on my down time to help them on an ongoing basis.

I will not be receiving an increase in my wages for this extra work.

This is a story repeated over and over again in late-capitalist America. Working people are expected to take on ever more labor, work ever longer hours and ever increase their productivity for the same (or less!) pay. And It should therefore be abundantly clear to anyone paying attention that it’s the managerial and owner classes who really want “free stuff” - free man-hours, free labor and free output. They want it from you and me, and they know that they can take it, because - by and large - we have no other choice but to accept their terms.

By contrast, the “free stuff” that we want is nothing more than our fair share of what is being taken from us. And we want you to have yours, too.",False,eq9owj,RachelTheEgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eq9owj/the_managerialowner_classes_and_free_stuff/,2,1

There was an internal job posting for a position we call a lane monitor. Basically your an associate who does whatever the fuck you were already doing, but management can come tap you on the shoulder and ask you to run a specific lane while they do something else (fuck around with their friends in the back). I don't mind doing this since I won't have to put up with the other assholes and I get to do the same job I've been doing basically, just with more power.

There's also an opening for a trainer so I'm taking a risk applying as they might try to get me to do that but I'll get more hours so I guess it's not all that bad. Now we get into the meat of the story.

I went to HR to get the application and they have this white chick that's fairly new. I included her race because most of the complaints about her come from all the minorities in the building but she could just be an asshole, I don't know. I asked her for one of the applications and her ass snapped at me with attitude, ""YoU CaN't GeT OnE RiGhT NoW."" I knew this was a lie because a good acquaintance of mine held the position before getting promoted and they've been begging people for the last week or 2 to apply. I was seconds away from walking off before another manager lady walked up and cut her off saying, ""hi awesometjgreen, the applications are over there sweety"" and she pointed me in the right direction all while HR bitch gave a look of shock and anger all twisted into one.

Now this manager lady for some unknown reason is really nice to me. She's a raging bitch as well. I've seen her write people up and turn all red over the slightest of mistakes, yet whenever she comes by to check my work (pretend she's working) she's super polite and talks about her family and shit.

If it weren't for her stepping in I wouldn't even be able to apply for the shitty job! This is why greedy Corporations deserve to fail. They only promote their friends or people they like regardless of who they are or what skills they bring to the table. I wouldn't be surprised if after I turn this shit in and wait I see some bootlicker get the position and we have to deal with him or her fucking up Everything.

554,Got out of a week-long conference,"Warning for some slightly gross content.

My job requires me to travel out of town for conferences. Won't go into too much detail about my employer but it's government. My job could be done in three hours every day but they insist on keeping 9-5 hours ""for the public"". It's a good job but I prefer doing anything else at this point. The conferences are pointless; they're one big circlejerk paid for by the taxpayer. Last time I went to one I was bored out of my skull and starved since I have a restrictive diet. The best part was sleeping in the nicest hotel I've ever been in, but even then I prefer my own apartment. 

Anyway, I had to get out of this conference. I will preface this by saying that this is incredibly stupid and I cannot suggest anybody do this, I have a decent constitution and am pretty healthy but still wouldn't suggest it to most. We were set to leave this morning and I made a plan to get out of it yesterday. I stayed up way too late to give my body the appearance of illness, didn't eat breakfast, and didn't drink anything. I looked like shit and my head hurt. Everyone in the office kept asking if I were alright since I was spacing out and I had to reassure them that I'm alright, I just need to eat on lunch.

 On lunch I ate a few slices of bread and made my ticket out of this conference. I mixed together some saltwater in a reusable coffee cup. We all had to get our fingerprints recorded and a background check done at the sheriffs department, and we rode together. The entire time I had a warm cup of saltwater in my hand and I'm getting anxious. I almost backed out since the prospect of drinking saltwater is disgusting. We finish up here, which kind of helped because cops and jails make me anxious and it made me look even sicker. 

Before anybody else can get in the car, I chug the water. Nose plugged, down the hatch, and I had to keep a straight face. The effects were almost immediate but I let them stew for the car ride back. The driver looked back and asked if I were OK, and I said of course I am. The moment we get back to the parking lot I open the door and pop like a soda can. Everyone is concerned and ask if I'm alright. They all mention how I looked off today and I said I must have caught something when I went to the grocery store this weekend. I haven't thrown up in a few years and forgot what a number it does to your body, now I was legitimately sick. Without warning, I throw up again. It's in my beard, hair, and out of my nose. I conjure up some phony tears about how I don't want to miss the conference. The director says I probably have the flu and should just stay home this week.

Mission fucking accomplished. I want my Academy Award for Best Actor. Granted I'm going to have to dry clean my jacked and scarf I was wearing, but I'm now off for a week and don't have to hear about boring bureaucratic bullshit from 8am-7pm all week.

**GROWING UP, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY I WAS THE BLACK SHEEP IN MY FAMILY..**

Both my parents were academic. 

My father was a scientist, my mother a journalist. My older sister became an architect.

I found school uninspiring and didn’t really apply myself. I did enough to get by.

I really just enjoyed playing football (soccer), kayaking, judo, swimming, cycling and long distance running.

Looking back on my life, I suppose growing up I was really keen to make my parents happy. 

As a result, I chose a path in life that was based on what I thought others expected of me (both by my family and society) 

The subjects I studied at 17 or 18 years old were based on what my father considered to be ‘appropriate’ or ‘suitable’ and as a result, I found it really difficult to pay attention and really commit to studying.

It was the same story when I went to University. I really just went because that is what I thought I was supposed to do.

I therefore didn’t have much enthusiasm and I felt massively unfulfilled and this would continue throughout the next 15 plus years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 17 OR 18 YEARS OLD, I HAD PRETTY MUCH ABANDONED SPORT AND STARTED SMOKING WEED DAILY..**

Soon enough, I became partial to a ‘wake and bake’ and would indulge in ‘hippy speedballs’. 

I would miss class, smoke weed in lunch break and before exams.

Once I had graduated and was working, I continued to smoke weed most days. 

Over time, I found myself in bars three or four times a week and developed a weekly cocaine habit (London is the Cocaine capital of Europe).

I was bouncing around aimlessly, I was uncertain and indecisive; with no clear vision of what I wanted for my life. 

Reflecting on my life to date, I have worked in a whole host of different jobs; I’ve done graveyard shift litter picking after festivals, worked in retail, as a waiter, for charities, community centres, social enterprises, NGOs, branding agencies and tech agencies.

I’ve been sacked, made redundant or the funding for my role ran out. The last role I had, the company went into liquidation. 

By this time, I realised that this was not a coincidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I BECAME FRUSTRATED, WAS IN SELF DOUBT AND DIDN’T KNOW WHERE TO GO. I SLUMPED INTO AN ‘UNEMPLOYMENT DEPRESSION’..**

There was a pattern emerging here. I found myself in this constant cycle of working in jobs that didn’t fulfill me.

I asked myself a series of questions

* Was I really supposed to just get another job that I hated and continue resenting my life?
* Was I really just supposed to get a job, so I could get paid, perhaps get a mortgage? 
* And go on the occasional holiday?
* Is this what life was really about? 

I was depressed at being unemployed, but equally depressed at the thought of returning to work in an industry that left me unmotivated and uninspired.

Inside, I knew I was capable of something. I just didn’t know WTF it was...

I continued applying for jobs, had interviews and was rejected each time.

&amp;#x200B;

**AFTER A FEW MONTHS, I STOPPED LOOKING..**

My attention slowly began to focus in a new direction. 

I had stumbled across this guy called Dandapani on Youtube (he’s a hindu priest, philosopher and spiritual coach who works with athletes and CEOs in the US). 

I watched a video of his and he said “do not seek happiness, pursue a life were the byproduct is happiness.”

This really resonated with me. This is what I needed to do.

I wanted this life where the byproduct was happiness.

I remember being in my flat and brainstorming:

* What are the three or four most important things to me?
* What kind of life or lifestyle would make me happy?
* If I could build this life or lifestyle, what would it look like?
* How would it make me feel?

I proceeded to redefine who I was. 

I simplified my life and focused all my time and energy on the three or four key things that really mattered to me. 

My physical and mental wellbeing was top of that list. 

I resumed the things I loved doing in my youth.

I started running again, I took up yoga and was kickboxing four times a week (I later entered a kickboxing competition). 

The kickboxing competition put me in a situation where I needed to do everything within my circle of influence (a reference from the Stephen Covey Book - The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) to ensure I didn’t get the sh\*t kicked out of me.

[This was one of a handful of books that triggered dramatic changes in my life](https://preview.redd.it/lqonz8xp2ya41.jpg?width=322&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0523b6522e88f553a757fde844e478d1a053f498)

&amp;#x200B;

**HAVING THIS CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF ME MADE ME STOP DRINKING, SMOKING AND TAKING DRUGS..**

I noticed the significant improvements in me and I never went back to drinking, smoking to taking drugs after that.

I became increasingly curious and developed a real passion for learning and reading. 

With the time I had, I began reading more. An interest in psychology, philosophy and personal development emerged organically.

I expect part of this was because I was doing things on my terms and I was doing things that interested me for a change.

Initially I said I would give myself three months off but my period of unemployment lasted about ten months.

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPENT THE MONEY I HAD SAVED SINCE THE AGE OF 21 - IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THE DEPOSIT FOR A MORTGAGE..**

It was tens of thousands of pounds.

Some people would have considered that a waste of money (my father was one of them). 

From the outside he saw me unemployed for all that time and assumed I was wasting my life away. 

To me, it was the best investment I could have made with my life.

That money bought me time. I used that time to invest in myself which enabled me to discover and develop my passion.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO FIND MY TRUE PURPOSE IN LIFE..**

I realised that possessions, a house, money, holidays and material things meant nothing to me unless is was totally fulfilled.

My savings were depleted but I had achieved the fulfilment and happiness that Dandapani had spoken of and had started to take control of my life.

I’d abandoned my self destructive lifestyle, moved away from toxic people. I had truly redefined who I was.

I now found great comfort in my own company. I spent my time meditating, reflecting on life and in the company of books.

Having made this transition, I asked myself 

* How can I earn an income from this lifestyle?
* How could I make enough money to survive doing the things I love?

I looked back on my past and what I was doing with my life. 

It seemed to make sense to me to retrain as a personal trainer and pursue a career in personal development as a life coach.

This would give me the opportunity to help others to achieve the results they want to see both in their personal and professional lives.

I realised that it would be difficult in the sense that I was starting again from scratch with no contacts and jumping into unknown territory.

But I looked back on my past and reflected on how I would look on this in the future.

This was a unique opportunity for me to finally pursue my truth.

I had also come to the realisation that money meant nothing unless I was totally fulfilled.

At that point, I realised I needed to take the jump..

Looking back on this period of unemployment, I realised there were specific things that I did almost unconsciously that helped me get out of the depression that I experienced. 

I thought to myself there must be others going through this so put together a [short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyke9i20fFA&amp;feature=youtu.be) with the different tips / techniques that I used to help me get out of unemployment depression.",False,ep2f3u,LifeHackTraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ep2f3u/how_i_bounced_out_of_an_unemployment_depression/,2,1

It will be interesting to vent up a little.  
So here am I , I'm at work and I have nothing to do , like evryday. I'm listening to a [really good album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRfTgbiWVA&amp;t=0s) on my computer. It's okay I started to accept it.  
It makes me sick , I'm here for nothing. I cannot leave , or to be precise I don't have the courage to leave when I'm finished because rent , food yadi yada. I feel useless , I feel like I'm just a cog in one big mechanism.  
I'm basically only trading my dreedom right now , it's not even about workforce anymore , it's about the priviledge to have me to be able to ask me to do stuff whenever needs be.  
It's near 1 year I'm in this situation. My manager consider I should be the one to ask for more stuff to do. But I quickly realised something : people ask me when they need me. And I never say no because 1) I don't dislike my work , i dislike the lack thereof and 2) I have so much useless time there is always time in my schedule. I also realised that when I ask for work people don't really know what to ask me. It create theses situation where I'm like a trainee. In my country we have to do a traineesheep when we're like 14 yo to see what the work looks like but in a lot of case we are not given actual work. It's exactly like that and I hate it.  
Maybe I hate it so much because In my free time I ""work"" much more than that. I have a lot of hobby that apparent to work. Soapmaking (I want to start making it a living) , leatherworking, woodworking, alchemy ,etc... I love using my skills to create something usefull.... Exactly the inverse of what I do in my actual job.

The funny thing is on the album , as I lay theses word there is this sentence ""vivre dans leur monde ne t'apportera rien"" ""live in their world won't bring you anything"".

This situation is met with shame. I see all my colleagues working, I hate feeling like a sort of parasite , getting money without doing anything productive. I feel a lot of people around me would say ""I'd love getting paid doing nothing"" , no you wont , because ""doing nothing"" is not the same thing as ""free time""...

I don't know why I'm telling you all this , I just feel I needed to talk about it and debate about it to understand what is going on.

569,An office diary: dying inside a little more each day,"  

I should consider myself lucky because I work as a civil servant and tough we’re not high earners we do have interesting benefits and a good pension plan. I work within my (dull) field of study and I have a lot of autonomy. 

Unfortunately I must admit I am probably one of the most useless civil servant as my job doesn’t yield results of any kind of importance for anybody. For the last 14 years I’ve worked many barely useful job for the common good and I am thirsty for something meaningful. When I hear my bosses or coworkers I’m astonished at their ability to find the BS we’re doing something of importance. I stopped believing in that many years ago. 

Each day is like the day before and there is no hope of escaping my cubicle in this soulless gray concrete without natural light neo Stalinist building where I work in the short term. Even if I work in another branch I know the gloomy feeling of uselessness will come back haunt me. Anyway, like anybody, I need the job to keep up with everyday life expenses.

I feel that we are a waste of tax payer’s money as an organization. My division could disappear from the surface of the Earth and almost nobody would notice work wise. I envy those who have jobs with a real impact on others or on the society but I believe they’re not that common. Office jobs wherever they are destroy our soul one day at the time.

Pain, happiness, comfort, safety... anything that makes us humans. That's why I'm mostly art oriented. I thrive through human experiences.

Why am I punished for not caring about business things, thus forcing me to make my way through low paying work with not-so decent conditions? It's not my fault that I don't care about white-collar workers and what they do. I don't care about how to run a company. I'm forced to care at least a little bit, though, which I absolutely hate.

577,"How I bounced out of an unemployment depression, developed my passion and took steps to earn a living doing what I love - Tips and resources to help others to do the same..","**GROWING UP, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY I WAS THE BLACK SHEEP IN MY FAMILY..**

Both my parents were academic. 

My father was a scientist, my mother a journalist. My older sister became an architect.

I found school uninspiring and didn’t really apply myself. I did enough to get by.

I really just enjoyed playing football (soccer), kayaking, judo, swimming, cycling and long distance running.

Looking back on my life, I suppose growing up I was really keen to make my parents happy. 

As a result, I chose a path in life that was based on what I thought others expected of me (both by my family and society) 

The subjects I studied at 17 or 18 years old were based on what my father considered to be ‘appropriate’ or ‘suitable’ and as a result, I found it really difficult to pay attention and really commit to studying.

It was the same story when I went to University. I really just went because that is what I thought I was supposed to do.

I therefore didn’t have much enthusiasm and I felt massively unfulfilled and this would continue throughout the next 15 plus years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 17 OR 18 YEARS OLD, I HAD PRETTY MUCH ABANDONED SPORT AND STARTED SMOKING WEED DAILY..**

Soon enough, I became partial to a ‘wake and bake’ and would indulge in ‘hippy speedballs’. 

I would miss class, smoke weed in lunch break and before exams.

Once I had graduated and was working, I continued to smoke weed most days. 

Over time, I found myself in bars three or four times a week and developed a weekly cocaine habit (London is the Cocaine capital of Europe).

I was bouncing around aimlessly, I was uncertain and indecisive; with no clear vision of what I wanted for my life. 

Reflecting on my life to date, I have worked in a whole host of different jobs; I’ve done graveyard shift litter picking after festivals, worked in retail, as a waiter, for charities, community centres, social enterprises, NGOs, branding agencies and tech agencies.

I’ve been sacked, made redundant or the funding for my role ran out. The last role I had, the company went into liquidation. 

By this time, I realised that this was not a coincidence.

Last year I bought an Australia working visa. I am very tempted to head over there and basically just run away (I live in the UK). Yes I would have to do low paid work over there, but I could meet other travellers / new people in general and bounce ideas. Maybe meet someone there and never come back. I have a lot of savings (£20,000) so I would be able to tide myself over for a while.

I feel like I am going nowhere. I can't get any kind of decent job and I can't afford a house in the UK. However going abroad could be a waste of time.

593,Work is tearing my home apart,"All of this started when my housemate and close friend was in a horrific workplace accident. She is a fabricator, and her company was chronically understaffed bc her boss couldn't be bothered to pay a living wage. As a result she had to stay late last week. As a result she was alone. As a result she could not reach the emergency stop switch when she needed to. As a result her life is changed forever.

I'm one of her closer friends. I just want to visit her, she keeps asking our other friends about me. But at my workplace, over half the employees are sick. We are also understaffed, so people are forced to come in when they are sick. They get other people sick, including me--I've been fending off the nastiest flu all week. I can't risk giving it to my friend or it could seriously complicate her recovery. And I can't get better without putting my foot down and risking my job, or at least risking a desperately needed pay raise I'm due for.

She and I are blue collar. We live with her ex, a white collar sales dude who acts blue collar. He has taken this opportunity to be controlling to her and abusive to me.

596,"Colleague justifies his being treated unfairly in the workplace, not getting the full value he creates, undemocratic organization, etc.","A few months ago, our store's manager retired and his son took over the business. Within a few weeks, he introduced sweeping changes to the structure, duties, and expectations at our store: instead of employees specializing in specific departments (e.g. electronics, hardware, etc.), all employees were required to have working knowledge of all departments; he reduced the number of employees on staff; he deliberately wanted  to hire ""older"" applicants over younger ones because he wanted employees ""who were committed and not using \[company\] as a stepping-stone""; he ended the contract with the hotdog-vendor we have on our property, and replaced him with a hotdog vendor business run by his wife, etc. etc.

Our store also has fewer employees working shifts now, and so the employees who are on-shift have a greater work demand on their backs.

My colleague sees this and complains about various things, including:

* The undemocratic organization of the workplace. He calls our new manager, ""The Dictator""
* Inheritance to a position of power
* Unfair hiring practices
* Unrealistic workplace expectations
* Perceived ill treatment of the hotdog vendor
* And, most notably, complaining about producing more value for the company and only getting slivers of the value he creates in return.

I find these critiques often in left-leaning spaces. You may think he has left-leaning positions on society, the workplace, economics, etc., but no... he is a committed conservative who supports laissez-faire capitalism, and is staunchly ""anti-Left""

When talking about left-leaning analysis of this very situation, he rejects it and just says that this is the natural organization of society and there's nothing we can do about it. That we naturally have those who dominate and those who are subjugated. 

It's strange to see someone justify their own subjugation. 

It's painful when you see someone who is directly impacted and hurt by these very structures, acknowledges these problems, but then justifies them.

Not only that -- but justifies his own mistreatment...his own unfair treatment.

And, he's not a kid in his teens or 20s. He's a man in his 30s with bills to pay and a family to support who lives paycheck-to-paycheck.

As someone who would love nothing more than to not work another day as long as I live, we're all kind of in the shit together because living is an expensive habit to break. 



I've come to the realization that I've been running the hamster wheel, or rather been running a smaller hamster wheel contained within a bigger hamster wheel.  For years I've been stuck in the food service industry due to it being the only thing that consistently pays the bills. So much so that applying outside of the field is a useless juncture because no one will look at my resume and see me as anything but a cook Could I go back to school? Maybe, but not without cutting my income that affords me such luxuries as eating and having running water. I want to leave my current job, but it's not as easy as other jobs. I've worked 60 plus hours a week for a mom and pop shop that can't even give me the respect of giving me a paycheck that actually cashes when I go to deposit it. I'd quit, sure, but I have no idea how to traverse the fact that I'm 100% certain that they'd probably write me a bum check to send me on my way. For a year now, being told I was there best employee but for some reason find it appropriate to cut the legs out from under me when it comes to providing me the tools to provide service, and yet somehow blaming me for some of their shortcomings. No holidays off, no paid time off, no benefits, hell, I don't even get a comped meal without them huffing their nose at me. Now my options are 

A)start at the bottom for some place, more likely get paid less and potentially run into another POS owner or manager that will do the same or not worse or

603,Organizing For A Work-Optional Tomorrow,"I've been lurking on this sub for a few months now, and I'm finding it equal parts cathartic and frustrating. I feel like we're collectively on the cusp of some greater good, but I don't know that we're anywhere closer to actually doing something about it.

In many ways, I count myself very lucky. I have what many people would consider a very comfortable job doing something that I usually enjoy. But, so many other people *aren't* this lucky, and even I have times when I'd rather be doing something else for a while. It frustrates and angers me that virtually no one has the freedom to simply take a few months to focus on some particular hobby, or to take a chance on some new potential career, all because taking those opportunities comes with incredible potential risk in our society.

It's 2020, and we're just starting to realize that work should not define us. We're more than a job. I firmly and deeply believe that not *everybody* has to work, and I look forward to the day when automation has made more free time for more people. But, man, getting from here to ther is going to be *messy as hell*, and I'm not real excited about that. All you have to do is be honest about this stuff on social media and watch the backlash to know that a large portion of the population is not ready to hear this truth.

So, what do we do about it? How do we educate and advocate for ourselves? I lean pretty left, but I think there's an opportunity here to rally around freedom from work without tying ourselves to any particular political party or political movement. I don't think you need to be a socialist to see this stuff, even a die-hard capitalist can be convinced that in a modern economy there can be more individual freedom from tying work to the ability to simply live a modest, decent life.

Anyway, I would love to hear what other people think about this. Do you have experience doing political organization and advocacy? What do you think?

During an internship years ago, I bragged about the fact that I was so focused on my job I didn't even connect my iPhone to the office WiFi throughout the entire internship (because I was SO into that boring work that I never even looked at my phone). My fellow interns looked at me admiringly as I boasted about this. I was drinking the Kool-Aid. I was the typical die-hard, rise-and-grind, unbearably annoying bootlicker we despise on this sub.

What turned me to the dark side was the degradation of my health over a couple years working an office job. All the stress/unnatural conditions caused me to develop permanent, incurable, time-consuming diseases (Meibomian Gland Dysfunction is one of them - stare at a computer screen all the time and you're at risk). At this point, I realized it was all a lie and that I've been robbed of something I'll never get back: my fucking health. Words cannot express how betrayed and infuriated I felt. 

I spend a ridiculous amount of time scrubbing my eyelids, applying warm compresses to my eyes, doing eyelid massages, taking supplements, and applying drops just to make sure my condition doesn't worsen. I have to do this every day twice a day or else my condition will progress. My doctor told me staring at computer screens all day is not natural, and that Meibomian Gland Dysfunction is not normal.

Why? Because I barely see my family as it is. I work longer hours than I like and I have a long ass commute. I have an infant daughter and being a good father to her is more important than my career (sucks that in our society, you usually have to pick one). My weekends are sacred.

I was laid off from my shitty data entry job the past April due to some contracts not going through. I was devastated at first, but then happy to see it go. ($14/hr, no PTO or paid holidays) This led to being the best summer I ever had. My mom took care of me in exchange for doing some projects around the house while I searched for jobs. Now I am dealing with callers that don’t know a computer mouse from a hole in their ass and I can’t even go to the bathroom without that time coming from my 2 15 minute paid breaks. I’ve become a lot less patient since I started working. My days consist of fantasizing about winning the lottery throwing my job out like the hot garbage it is.

625,What percentage of current jobs do you think could be automated if that was REALLY the clear intent of civilization?,"Setting aside for the moment the myriad of arbitrary nonsensical destructive bullshit time wasting jobs that only exist in current society to circulate the abstraction of 'money' and so from a tangible and rational point of view, ought not to exist at all to begin with, I have a question for you all:

If the deliberate and explicit aim of modern human civilization was to abolish ANY need for work performed by humans - by utilizing the best of available technology and applying our knowledge with a razor sharp focus on deliberate maximum automation - what percentage of truly necessary work relative to the work done today do you think would actually be left over? 

My estimate - around 15 percent perhaps maximum would be left unable to be automated with advanced robotics, today. And of course through time as technology and knowledge moves forward we would eventually get it even lower than that.

Now that means that if 15 percent of work is left over to be done and the human species shares that remaining work based also on level of training, know-how and fields of interest etc. then the work time per week for human beings would of course be SIGNIFICANTLY less, to say the least. 

What are your estimates? I mean there are many in depth books going all the way back to 1833 about moving away from any human beings HAVING to work anymore to be allowed to be alive - due to the increasing capacity to automate drudgery. So many social thinkers, scientists, engineers etc. have talked about this for decades and even centuries by now. Even though it's mostly not mainstream, most people have no clue about the capacity for humans to overcome the need for most work.

What irked me is they rejected me on my technical skills which at the very least were more than adequate for the role. I’d rather they just said “you wouldn’t fit in here” than make out I was under qualified. They even gave me a test that I’m sure had the wrong data in.

My main goal with this job search is finding something with that all elusive ‘good fit’.

638,"""Good Manager"" Books","A huge indicator the company is absolutely toxic is when their managers are given books to read on how to be a good manager.

This is a symptom of several things:
*They are not hiring the right people for management and they don't know what kind of person it takes to be one.
*They see a problem with their floor workers that they are not willing to address with them upfront.  They are inclined to let issues fester.
*Their management is top heavy.  There are managers with nothing to do and create busy work for workers.

In my experience, this toxicity is compounded after managers read these books.  How is that possible?  On the surface, it seems the company wants to remedy issues and train its people to interact better with the main workforce.  Reality is, it is a way to avoid what the main workforce really requires... better compensation, resources, fulfillment.  Essentially, anything that requires real investment in the worker.

All these suggested tactics and buzzwords are designed to extract every drop it can from the workers without any tangible benefit to the worker.  Already, the worker can sense how insincere it all is.  Participating in ""huddles"", ringing the bell, 5S, Kaizens... being in workplace strategies like hot-desking, office hoteling, activity based working, the creation of worthless titles...  its disingenuous and creates despair.  The realization that the company prefers a show over over anything else.

Why do they want this show?  Are they that detached?  Why can it not be seen that good work will be done if people are well compensated, requested resources are provided, and the job fulfills a tangible purpose.

646,Feeling guilt tripped after calling in sick,"I've been going through a lot of struggles with my mental health lately, whilst looking after my partner who is going through much worse. He actually posted on here the other day about it which prompted me to post here too and have a little rant. His employer threatened to sack him for having time off for mental health problems. 

I work part time as a receptionist at a religious non profit centre in the UK. I work a few evenings a week and a couple of Saturdays a month. I'm the sole employee working at one time, so calling in sick isn't as straightforward, as you need cover.

This morning I emailed to say I really could do with not working this evening due to the stress that's built up. I feel really weak and really need to rest. I was supposed to be working an extra shift this evening to a train up a new receptionist (my job share). I offered to do it several weeks ago, but wasn't anticipating my mental health to be half as bad as it is. I emailed explaining that I'm stressed, feel weak, and I explained everything that had been going on in my personal life that had led to this. I said it would be useful to talk about it at my appraisal in a few weeks.

I expected a reply to have at least a small amount of sympathy. I know it was last minute and it's difficult for them to find cover and make arrangements, but I don't call in sick for the fun of it. Instead the reply I got offered no acknowledgement to my health and essentially said ""we can't find anyone, I guess I'll have to think of something"" which felt like such a guilt trip. I'm now sat here feeling even worse, when I really need a ""self care"" day.

I don't even know how to reply to the email, if at all.",False,epip73,psychgirl97,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/epip73/feeling_guilt_tripped_after_calling_in_sick/,9,1

It's in the big city next town over!  

They got all of us a hotel room and bought out bars/restaurants!

It's a 2 day trip with 8 hours of exciting ""breakout sessions"" and speeches each day from the BIG DAWGS!

Then a *mandatory* cocktail hour! Professional attire is also *mandatory*!

I am not attending.  When I received the invitation in my email there was an option ""if you cannot attend  please decline your invite by selecting 'no'"" so I selected No.

Now it is apparently a problem as managers have told all of us that the meetings throughout the day are mandatory.  I haven't had a discussion with my boss yet, but I'm kind of surprised at how my employer feels entitled to my time so much as to attempt to require me to leave my wife and pets at home, or bring my wife with me and board my pets.  It's like they are shocked that I'm not jumping at the chance to go spend a full 48 hours with my coworkers.  

I made another post the other day on this sub about the slap in the face of a pay increase we all just received.  I really don't feel like the company has displayed enough interest in my future to warrant my submission of so much of my own time and energy.

Now we are again in January. We just received our 2020 compensation plan... it's a 3% raise.

Ive gotten interviews, but that's where it always ends.

Is this seriously the best way organisations have for seeing if someone can do a job. You have my God damn CV, look at that. Don't fucking haul me up in front of three stone faced HR people with a list of questions and a fucking marking scheme. All you are testing is seeing who can rehearse the best bullshit. My problem is that I get so damn nervous. I'm fine talking to people, but the people across the desk with their clipboards in control of my future happiness. 45 minutes, and if you balls up, then get fucked.

This process seems designed to fuck with people with anxiety. I'm seriously at the end of my rope. I'm not looking for a 100k a year job, just something stable that means I can move on with my miserable life.

I'm starting to be at my wit's end about coping with wage slavery.

This is the thread where we say the things that might provide relief to wage slavery.

Personally, I have some things, that maybe I ought to internalize more:
* Take personal pride in working as little as possible while maintaining appearance of a productive worker bee
* Steal supplies, give out things for free to working-class people whenever you can
* If your job has enjoyable aspects, attempt to focus on and enjoy those; I know this sounds silly but personally, I find it makes time pass faster
* When doing ""actual work"" at work, never stress yourself about results or deadlines; the toil never ends, there's no reason to work fast
* Support everyone who does no work for capitalists, homeless people, others who live off welfare etc.
* Support everyone who takes sick leave, whether they are sick or not; if your country has it, take sick leave liberally and feel no guilt because you and your free time are important, the capital of your slaver is not; you are not responsible for understaffing
* If it helps you and it's possible, listen to music or consume other media while at work
* Always praise the work of your fellow workers in front of capitalists
* Avoid getting captivated by things that slow time; for me, this happens when I'm on reddit or watching videos too much and that in and of itself starts stressing me out

I get it, they don’t like the millennials and zoomers wasting time on their phones, though I can tell you right now my bosses sure take time to sit on the couch and do nothing.

I’ve worked at a summer camp before where I was so hot and overworked with these impossible children that I got a heat stroke and fell asleep. No one asked me if I was ago, all I got was a reprimand and a warning - and if you’re wondering, it was a 40 hour job with below minimum wage pay. I got a fever multiple times that summer, and was still required to swim with the children even if I was sick or having a very heavy period. Keep in mind, I was a minor at this time, so apparently that means I’m strong enough and have the free time to do this without a fuss, because I’m supposedly naturally energetic, and never have dealt with stress before, obviously. 

The level of work I put in for college classes is insane, and the competition to do well vastly overshoots the need to learn. Ask anyone, they’d cheat on a test or project to avoid getting a bad grade even if that meant they never actually learned the material or did their own work. Why? Because the fear that you won’t get the grades to graduate and get a good job outweighs any sort of desire to just...learn and be a better person. When I’ve expressed this opinion to people they sort of just laugh, it’s too idealistic, I’ll resent this type of thinking when I’m older. College is for a career, not to get a major in underwater basketweaving gender studies, or at least that’s what I’ve been told.

Not to mention, I have to take so many hours that I usually don’t have time for more than one meal a day, or at least one meal where I actually can sit down and eat. 

I’m in an artistic field, though in a branch that’s supposedly more organized and lucrative. Everything is about what hustles I’ve done to pit on my resume. I’d rather work on less things and spend more time on them, but that doesn’t appear as credible. I’ve been chastised by peers for dropping some things due to the stress they put on me. “You’ll never get a job if you don’t hustle” it’s the mentality. 

Even my parents have made fun of me for spending time relaxing, even when I’m reading, which I thought was supposed to be intellectually stimulating and good for you.

Point is, all of this has led me to hate myself for simply wanting to take time off, for wanting to sleep enough at night and taking time for my own things. I want to unlearn this, and I intend to. I do want a job and I want to be independent, but I also want to live and be a human and actually enjoy the world around me. I know I’m not the only young person who feels this way but is told they just don’t know enough to make these types of statements.

724,"Anthony Bourdain once said ""There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons. My life is a series of strategems, to avoid, and outwit that guy"". Why does society punish ""that guy"" for existing?","https://www.mensjournal.com/features/anthony-bourdains-life-advice-20140919/

&gt;Look, I understand that inside me there is a greedy, gluttonous, lazy, hippie—you know? I understand that free time is probably my enemy. That if I’m given too much free time to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, I’m afraid of that inner hippie emerging. There’s a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, and smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons, and old movies. I could easily do that. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy. I make sure I commit to projects based on: Will they be interesting? I like to keep momentum going. I’m aware of my appetites, and I don’t let them take charge. It goes back to heroin: If heroin, or delicious delicious food, is the Number One thing on the to-do list every day, there probably won’t be a Number Two thing on your Things To-do list. You know?

It seems that the division of labor forces our lives into two distinct phases:

- Getting to work, and working on something specialized that is at least moderately boring or physically exhausting

- Getting home, and spending our leisure time on rest, drugs, and entertainment. 

I always ask myself ""What would a Hunter-Gatherer do?"" Humans spent millions of year without working, and somehow found life livable enough to make it to the next generation without fail. 

Hunter-Gatherers did not get up at 7am, drive for 1 hour on the interstate to work each day, check into their office job, check out, go back home, light a joint, and pour a drink with Archer on in the background. 

There was no job, no car, no drugs, and no TV. Yet each and every day must have been full of life and activity for most of them. 

In civilization, too much leisure, gets you unemployed and homeless. ""That guy"" who lays in bed, smokes pot, and watches TV all the time can't make it. The consequences are harsh.

Working too much might lead to addiction but you will likely not find yourself unemployed and homeless. So it is encouraged.",False,epa9wu,Ctown_struggles00,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/epa9wu/anthony_bourdain_once_said_theres_a_guy_in_my/,9,1

Because my work is mostly just waiting on people to email me back about things, I have to just sit here and pretend to be working when there is 0 reason for me to be here I'd say at least 50% of the time, and I asked about their policy on remote work, and they pretty much said no.

There a reason for this. Taking up late is a form.
of laziness. It also makes you lazy throughout the
day. Most often these people don't even set up an
alarm clock and only wake up when they've slept

enough.

Not only will you have missed important business
hours already but you will also feel foggy and
sluggish. Most high-paying jobs (Company

achieve maximum productivity and with all the

so by waking up late.

In America, we live to work, not work to live. It is like some kind of massive cult following when you really think about it. And why are we expecting so much out of work to begin with? I feel like many of us, myself included, are looking for work to be some kind of answer to the existential crises we face in life, or a substitute for deep meaning. Will or can ""work"" ever provide that anyway?  Maybe we need to drop that whole line of thinking. You know, thinking that a person's worth or value to society depends on what job they do (ie how much money they make). Or thinking that a job can or should provide us with artistic outlet, or give us a sense of meaning in life.

I feel like if this is an expectation I should be rostered on 10 minutes earlier/later for each shift, not expected to work for free. Only takes 6 shifts for it to add up to an hour of unpaid work. 

It's also frustrating because the process of getting your till from the cash office at the start of your shift is already a 5 minutes process, then walking to the shop floor another couple of minutes. 

I cherish every minute before I have to go back to the bizarre mind numbing fake world of retail, the last thing I want to do is give them more of my time for free.

790,"I'm back at work after a long holiday vacation, and work feels worse than ever. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.","Last Thursday was my first day back to my office after taking extended vacation time for Christmas and New Year’s. Every day since has been miserable. My job has been progressively getting worse over the past year after a coworker I was close to was fired for no reason and without warning. Management didn’t properly sort out her job duties and split them up, so I’ve had to pick up pieces of her projects – often on the fly or after something has gone wrong and it looks like my fault. On top of all that, I have an hour commute to my office and my manager has told me in no uncertain terms that working from home is not an option.

I’m at the end of my rope. I’m physically and mentally exhausted. I’ve been looking for other jobs but am having trouble finding something. Honestly, looking through job openings and descriptions is depressing. They all look awful and soul sucking. I dread the interview process and all of the bullshit that comes along with it.

What I really want to do is take time off work. A month, half a year, whatever it takes to reclaim my physical and mental health. Theoretically I have enough money saved up to cover my general living expenses (rent, gas, utilities, food) for at least 6 months. The main dilemma I’m having is health insurance. I am in the United States and health insurance on the free market (rather than through an employer) is really expensive. I’ve had some health issues in the past (and some chronic ongoing issues) so I’m hesitant to go without insurance.

I probably need to just hang in there until I can find a new job with a shorter commute, but it’s hard to hang in there and to find the energy to job search as things slowly get worse and worse at my current job. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here. Maybe some encouraging words or feedback from others who have been in or who are currently in the same situation. If anyone has quit working without a clear plan of what to do next, I’d love to hear your stories too.

I hope you all are having a good Wednesday and hanging in there through the endless work cycle.",False,elwmrc,imaginarybanana,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/elwmrc/im_back_at_work_after_a_long_holiday_vacation_and/,17,1

Schooling dosen't have to so expensive or difficult in this age, especially when billion-dollar corporations need skilled workers.  But instead you pay pay pay only for a slight chance to achieve a living nightmare under them.  

The sad part is that most think this is the best we can do, it isn't.  We have been dripped-fed things like the internet only if it benefits them.  (Can't be anonymous to your enemy if it is just you and him!)  So we essentially pay for everything but only get what benefits the ones wearing the boot.

817,Aftermath of escaping the rat race,"My husband and I get by okay on one single part-time income.  He works 4 partial evenings a week 3 miles down the road at a steak house at a 'leave it at the door' kind of job, with the perk of being fed while there and bringing extra home sometimes.  Since it's evenings we don't need to set an alarm clock.  I'm a SAHW.  We both have a child each, both are grown.

It took us a few hard years to get here, and we definitely live the low-income life, but we have everything we need.  It's enough.  A few years ago we took some raw unwanted inherited land and carved out a spot, moved a free mobile home onto it.  It's small, older, and still in need of work but there's a roof over our head, no rent or mortgage, and taxes are cheap.  Yes, we got lucky there.  We both drive older beater vehicles that the husband can work on.  We said goodbye to more, more, more and said hello to enough.  

The aftermath of finally getting to this place of only needing one part-time job is now I'm not able to relate to people I know in real life.  The people I know cannot fathom why either of us aren't actively looking for full time work 24/7.  Every one of them just assume both of us should be working full time, at least, if not more.  It's so normal and ingrained that something other than thinking isn't registering.  They assume we want more things, better house, better cars, better everything.  I get text messages from people with job openings here or there.  I'm polite and thank them and promptly ignore it.  Then get the same in person when around people.   Do I try to explain?  Or is it hopeless?

818,You cannot be a musician and a capitalist .,"I am musician with a master’s degree who grew up poor, in a town poisoned by cancerous chemicals by big corporations, where the water is undrinkable because of coal ash pollution and the arts have been largely defunded.

I am not a lazy person, I have received multiple awards and scholarships and full-tuition waivers. I have practiced over 10,000 hours on my instrument and spent numerous years of monk-like dedication to my craft. I have worked more hard on music than most people work in their entire lives and I truly believe that.

But at the current point of my journey I have realized that: I cannot compete in a capitalistic frame.

Despite grit and the overcoming of the adversity I have faced, I still cannot compete with children of the rich who have infinite resources and time to do whatever they want. I cannot compete with children who have had funded music programs, private lessons their entire life, summer camps and more. 

The problem goes deeper when you learn about musicians who fly from Colorado to Illinois to have a lesson with their teacher of choice EVERY WEEK, a recording studio and have a dedicated accompanist.

I cannot compete with that. Someone has to pay these student loans off.

Through my arduous journey, I have realized that “skill” is “focused time spent.” That being said, how can a musician whose poor material conditions possibly compete with one from a high material condition? How could you possibly? Then account for how small the job market is for musicians? 

Only the rich can withstand the expensive conditions of an audition circuit and continue to practice and perform at this extreme level. 

So, if you are a musician and a capitalist you are either: a fool or your parents pay your rent.

From here this leads me to how this fits into a broader narrative:

If we know that skill is focused time spent and that the quality of focused time spent is determined by interest in the field—— why do we have so many people working these dead end, useless jobs? 

What if we removed the financial barriers to become a doctor and allowed whoever could prove themselves to do the work to become one? We could probably have cancer cured by now.

We are a society that wastes it’s people’s potential, we are ALL capable of high-functioning skill.  And at this point I think it’s intentional in order to support a small number of greedy elite.",False,ems6qu,OK6669,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ems6qu/you_cannot_be_a_musician_and_a_capitalist/,54,1

They were essentially saying that I’m doing the job required of me but that they were upset I wasn’t doing “more”. They never defined what “more” meant and that I needed to come up with it myself. 

They also contradicted themselves by saying that they want me to fix any issues that customers bring up but they don’t want to know about any of these issues. How can they know I’m fixing it if they don’t want to see them? Side note: these issues that customers are bringing up aren’t something I can usually fix anyways because it comes from other departments such as shipping or customer support. I’m just marketing. 

They gave me only a month to fix these things and that if I haven’t shown a 70% increase then they would terminate my position. 

I don’t think it’s fair that they are only giving me a month to fix this. And I don’t find it fair that they won’t define the “bar” that I’m supposed to hit.

For two generations, globalization and financialization have been the two engines of global growth and soaring assets. Globalization can mean many things, but its beating heart is the arbitraging of the labor of the powerless, and commodity, environmental and tax costs by the powerful to increase their profits and wealth.
**A key element in globalization is the transfer of risk from the owners of capital to the workers and public resources.** Examples of this transfer of risk abound: rather than pay workers benefits, corporations game part-time/full-time labor laws so workers' health insurance is paid by taxpayers (Medicaid). Corporations pay wages too low to survive so workers depend on public-sector assistance (food stamps, etc.)

Rather than provide vehicles to workers who drive for a living, corporations such as Uber and Lyft transfer all the risks of ownership, maintenance and enterprise to the drivers. And so on.
Financialization is the exploitation of assets/income that were previously safe from predation by those with access to low-cost central bank credit.

Rather than provide vehicles to workers who drive for a living, corporations such as Uber and Lyft transfer all the risks of ownership, maintenance and enterprise to the drivers. And so on.

Financialization is the exploitation of assets/income that were previously safe from predation by those with access to low-cost central bank credit.

One example is the student loan ""industry,"" which prior to financialization did not exist. A previously safe from predation asset/source of income--college degrees--has been securitized so that loans issued to students for largely worthless diplomas can be sold globally as ""secure assets with guaranteed yields.""
That the exploited class of students have little to no income and no guarantee of income doesn't matter. What matters is a previously unexploited asset can be turned into debt that can be sold at an immense profit.

**Alas, all good predations end when the herd of prey has been dragged to the ground and consumed.** All the fruit of financialization and globalization have been plucked by the powerful, and now both the engines of ""growth"" are sputtering.

**The prey always seem limitless to the predators, but this illusion expires when suddenly there is no longer enough for the ravenous pack of financial predators. At that point, the predators turn on each other. **",False,emssik,SleepNowMyThrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/emssik/by_not_participating_they_cannot_feed_on_your/,0,1

860,Mods Respond to Survey Feedback,"Hey, y'all! As always thank you so much for your continued participation and support of this subreddit. We make this survey twice a year, not only so we know who is using this subreddit for their benefit, but also so we can have your feedback and thus improve!

We got lots of *thank you*'s, which is really sweet. Much appreciate that!

Here's some feedback and suggestions we thought notable:

# free talk friday

&gt;I think a regular share your misery / solidarity thread would be nice.

According to the survey, roughly 30% of the users miss the weekly *Free Talk Friday* thread (while 68% don't care either way), so we decided to bring it back. Automod will post and pin a thread every week from now on.

...

# why do we care?

&gt;Thanks for putting this together and reading the responses.  You care more about my feedback than anyone I've ever worked with.

and

&gt;Making a poll shows you're quite serious about the quality of the subreddit.  Not saying that's bad or good but I sort of assumed this was the fruit of someone's shitty work day.  Is there any goal or agenda you're trying to accomplish?

The main reason we do these surveys/polls is that u/onedayitwillbedaisy is bit of a data nerd, but yeah, we really do care about the quality of the subreddit. As for a goal, well the goal is to reduce folks' workload, feelings of isolation in hating work and maybe, some day, ending work itself. This survey helps us towards that by improving this sub as a platform for those goals.

...

# election

&gt;I'm not American!

Sorry about the Americentrism in this survey. (editor's note: I take all the blame for badly written questions). We should try to always generalize and make our questions as accessible as possible and if there's any way for us to do this in the future, let us know!

...

# free speech

&gt;try to not suppress free speech

No freeze peaches here, sorry. The subreddit has rules, it is heavily moderated and we plan to keep it this way. We know this is a pretty stone cold response, but there isn't much else to say. We aren't the government and therefore don't have any obligation to the 1st amendment.

...

# positivity!

&gt;It would be cool if there was more discussion and solidarity in this sub. Although I agree with the premise 100%, I find browsing it to be depressing.

and

&gt;People whine a lot... could do with some positivity

and

&gt;please don't let this subreddit turn into another [r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/)

Comment by u/AbolishWork: 

This sub *does* have a propensity for depressing news and though we as mods try to uplift some positive threads (e.g. people getting out of the rat race, people quitting their jobs and feeling great, people trying to build worker solidarity) the negative tends to outweigh the positive. This is something we are well aware of but have mixed opinions on. Some of us think the negativity is important in of itself (i.e. it's not whining and that's dismissive) but that the human psyche can often overplay the   negative to the detriment of the positive. Part of us rectifying that will be to put in weekly Free Friday chats, which will hopefully get more discussion and more positivity. We'll also try to pin threads we think are awesome anti-work threads that highlight the positivity that can be inherent in the movement.

As for [r/collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/), I think there's some genuine risk of ""doomer"" talk getting a hold of the sub, but similar to my other point I think mods have enough tools in their arsenal to combat that push. I also think there is much more general negativity towards capitalism and the state then about all of us needing to build emergency shelters, fallout basements and gather water bottles and canned foods. That's my perspective and experience though, maybe someone else has more to say.

Comment by u/onedayitwillbedaisy:  

I don't like the ""life sucks and we can't do much about it"" vibe of some posts and comments, but I don't have to like everything on the subreddit. Probably the best way to bring some positivity to r/antiwork is to share things that inspire you, and upvote stuff you wanna see more of.

...

&amp;#x200B;

# solidarity!

&gt;I love this place, but we have to watch out that we fight together against work rather than fight each other. I've seen a lot of fighting between physical labourers and office workers, each insisting that they have it the worst. We need solidarity with each other.

Yup. Let's not fight each other. 

...

# more demographic stuff

&gt;More demographic stuff like race, marital status, age, and sexuality would be cool to see

Noted. We asked about age in [January 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/apywuf/survey_results/) and [July 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cei8pp/survey_results/), both with similar results. It should give you an idea of how old the anti-worker is on average.

...

# reposts

&gt;I see a lot of reposts (as in the front page of antiwork will often have duplicates)

For the record, we remove lots of reposts, almost every day. Sometimes we allow duplicates within a short time span, because for some reason the second post often gets a lot more attention, and it doesn't make sense to remove the first one. The best way to help us deal with reposts is to report them.

...

# privacy

&gt;If possible, maybe don’t use Google surveys.

Ok, that one's from the survey we did in July last year. I honestly forgot to look for a good alternative. So to make up for that, I wanna ask you to check out [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/), a site that provides services, tools and knowledge to protect your privacy against global mass surveillance. (Basically, it tells you why you should use Firefox rather than Chrome, and what alternatives there are to Twitter, Gmail, Whatsapp, etc.)

# book club

&gt;A book club? Not joking, like a monthly book the subreddit could read and comment on if they chose.

In any case, what got my curiosity going was how it ties in with the way people get  so irate when they talk about being a ""grown up"" as a way to dismiss massive inequities under the neoliberal system. What does it matter to you if someone isn't grown up? Why get so angry? I believe this rage comes from the fact that the person's world view is undermined by those who fail to adapt to the system, those who are unable to thrive are the spectres of the system's barbarism. There are things one can legitimately get angry about, for example climate change deniers because our survival as a species is at stake, but if someone lives on the dole/at home etc what is it to anyone? Why get annoyed? I don't care if someone is on benefits, I feel bad for them if anything but not angry. 

Telling someone to grow up or be an adult with the attendant statements about the real world suck it up et al, are just ways to make the individual responsible for society's failures. It's massively ironic that society cannot accept responsibility for its own flaws yet passes the buck onto the individual and makes this somehow a virtue, to be solely answerable to oneself. Tell that to people who are born with a disability, in poverty, in a bad situation or just have no luck due to the randomness of existence. There is a long list of societal failures, things that were once considered as values and which often involved prejudice and persecution/enslavement against one group or another. If anything I define adulthood as hypocrisy, I seldom see adults behaving as such, but more like ignorant and cowardly liars. I'm not saying it isn't good to be independent and so on, but considering how fucked the world is, we shouldn't be hard on ourselves if we don't measure up to what society dictates as a successful adult considering society itself is devouring itself due to its contradictions.",False,emhq9c,TheCassiniProjekt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/emhq9c/being_a_so_called_freakin_adult/,4,1

All to work for minimum wage assuming you pass.  In Canada that's not as terrible as it it in the US but yeah forking over money for training they should give workers for free is just bad. I realize it's partly to make sure people are serious about the job; yet knowing that after you pay the fee and do the course it's still not guarantee you're even going to have a job at the end of it is just unethical.  

If it's about just learning software, they really should offer it as free training especially if you are already hired.

I think insurance in my area is the same  - even worse because you are told to take a ""prep"" course before getting licensed at the first level. No wonder why the recruiter was interested in me (guy with about 1.5 years of experience) because they saw a way to make money off me first. 

Imagine hired at McDonalds and have to pay them to train you to flip burgers instead of providing free employee training which for a job that does not require experience in doing so should be logical and done. That's how this feels. It's an insult. And yes, only for minimum wage and from what I've read the job dealing with angry customers.  I remember a slogan in McDonalds about ""earn while you learn.""

However, there was a discrepancy between the amount she paid and the amount that she reportedly took out of the store. The cashier (who was also fired) is on film pocketing the gift card that Hannah said she no longer wanted, meaning that the gift card was activated but never paid for. They have this on film, but they fired Hannah anyway because they, “can’t be sure of exactly what happened.”

I'm currently admitted into a community college and am most likely getting a scholarship that will pay for most if not all of tuition and other expenses.

The thing is, I was planning on majoring in business and then transferring to an out-of-state college for fashion merchandising. Then I realized you can only really ""make it"" in New York or Los Angeles, which is way too expensive and I'm sure as hell not going to an overpriced college and racking up debt for a chance in an extremely competitive area of work that I may not even get into. Not to mention, I would've most likely have gotten an office job. I'm not too sure on how much id like one, but the general opinion here is that they're horrible.

So, what's really the best thing to major in or an area of work to get into, in terms of pay and not being a slave? I've been looking into trade as I've heard the pay is pretty good and the hours aren't horrible, so I'd still be able to pursue fashion on the side.

I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to post this, it's just one of the only subreddit I know of that isn't obsessed with sending everyone to expensive colleges and living the rest of their lives paying off debt.",False,em55fn,takedownhisshield,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/em55fn/best_thing_to_do_in_regards_to_college/,15,1
897,The supervisors can have a fridge for their lunches but not us,"I work for a clinic that services children and young adults with autism and behavioral problems lucky enough to love what I do but we are grossly underpaid, along with it being almost impossible to eat lunch at work. Because part of the job is teaching our clients social skills, we do not get a lunch break. I don’t mind, I enjoy eating with the children I work with. 

The problem is, we recently moved into a new building where we were told we would not be getting a refrigerator (only one mini fridge meant to be used for kids meals only)  and would have to do with two microwaves (in a bigger building with even more new kids and staff coming in). The kids I work with have behavioral issues, this leads to tantrums that hold up the line to the microwaves. This job is very physically active and just exhausting in general so being able to eat well is important! But I figured I’d suck it up and deal with this. Until I went down to the office where all of the supervisors are and saw a fridge where they were keeping all of their lunches...

I know this all might sound incredibly petty but I’m just so sick of there being a separate set of rules for management. We are the ones doing the stressful (often times more physical) work everyday, trying to help these kids reach their potential. The last few meetings we’ve had have pretty much all been about how we are not working hard enough. I work full time and I don’t even get paid enough to live anywhere without roommates. And even then, it is barely enough to survive on.

903,Shoutout to all the people who have had to work jobs that limit your time spent in the bathroom. :),"Shoutout to everyone else too on here while I'm at it, but the title is specifically because of a job I had a couple years ago at a telemarketing company.

We had 45 minutes of time allotted for being away from the phones at this company. This included your 30 minute lunch break. 

So, we'd have 15 minutes all day to use the bathroom, walk to the kitchen for a snack or drink, or literally anything that would remove you from the phones.

The best part was that this was timed from your phone at your desk. So you would set the timer in your phone and walk away, which would be tracked by your team lead that sat at the end of the aisle. 

Due to digestive issues, pooping by itself usually takes 12 minutes. Sometimes I can get it done in under 8 if I force everything out and grow a couple hemorrhoids. 

So most days, I would have 3 minutes left if I pooped at work. This would give me 3 minutes to grab a drink at the water fountain, or just grab a snack from the vending machine. 

And of course, management said ""Oh don't worry about going over the 45 minutes! As long as it's not a pattern, it's okay.""

But guess who pooped too many times at work and was considered for making it a pattern of taking 50+ minutes worth of breaks (including the 30 minute lunch) at work? This guy. 

Never got fired for it, but got a couple critical performance reviews from my managers which was a healthy boost in anxiety. 

I quit after 4 months. Being tracked for your breaks is my least favorite part of working. 

My next job did the same thing at first, but the team I worked with was really small, so it didn't affect me as much. This new boss confronted me about taking too many breaks, so I told him that if he's concerned about me using the bathroom too often I will be sure to send him photos of the toilet after I use it but before flushing so that he can make sure I am using my time diligently (I've actually had a friend send pictures of his diarrhea to his boss before because he was afraid his manager wouldn't believe him).

914,Why is nothing ever done about bad bosses?,"I work in fast food. There is this manager who has had it for me for awhile now because she thinks I'm disrespectful and mean when in reality most of the time I've been ""disrespectful"" are because I'm overloaded with stress, tired, or have been working my ass off and am not in the mood. 

Maybe it's because it's McDonalds, but they have this thing about standing around when we have nothing to do. But sometimes, depending on which position you're working there's literally nothing to do. Especially for the position I work every shift, which is back Boothe. 

It's kind of retarded because if we have no orders or anything, this manager won't let us joke around with one another or have any fun. I get it's work, but I don't have the luxury of being able to go out whenever I want. Work is the only place I go other than home, because I don't have many friends. Sometimes I just don't know what to talk about either, because I've become so used to being alone that I tend to think about shit nobody else is thinking about. It weirds people out. 

But I've had several incidents with this manager sending me home for no reason. All include yelling at me over something small. I don't understand how it's acceptable to mistreat the people who work for you. 

She kicked me out last time and told my boss I quit even though she told me to go home. It doesn't make sense as to why she still works there. 

Today she yelled at me in front of a customer for ""not being nice to customers"" because I was trying to take this guys order and also take money.

I live in the UK and have struggled to get a job that isn't minimum wage. There simply aren't many opportunities. The top companies make you go through graduate schemes which are too competitive, so I gave up on those. Job websites are really bad and all they offer me are sales and recruitment jobs. Last week, a sales company offered me a role where I would stand on the high street and ""engage"" with passers by - basically cold calling but not over the phone. Applying directly to companies hasn't yielded much success either, as I never hear back.

I have gone through years of this nonsense and my self-believe and confidence is shot. I am 32 this year and I am seriously panicking that I will not be able to get a good job in order to support myself. I still live at home.

My education has mostly gone to waste. I studied physics and scored highly enough for another university to offer me an MSc with a full stipend and bursary. I studied nuclear physics, nuclear engineering, decommissioning, safety case law, environmental policy, nuclear waste management etc etc. I finished it last year and still no employers care. They all want experienced workers who already know what to do.

Some more weeks passed and I hadn't received the bonus yet (""I guess they need to be processed or go through the bank or something""). Now I can't remember how we got to this, but I was talking with a colleague and my brother and apparently *that colleague* had gotten the bonus for recruiting my brother. It must have been a mix-up from their end since they were acquainted (studied together) and she had recruited others, too.

So I went down to HR to let then know about it, just in, ""hey, my bonus was given to X, can you send it to me please thanks bye"", out, done. And then the exchange struck me, less than a minute after I had left.

As I said I went in, told them to rewire that bonus, and HR got upset and asked why I hadn't come and told them sooner.......

Like BITCH, I *just* found that out myself from another colleague, because I was naive enough you are qualified to do your damn job...

I almost worked 2 years there I think, couldn't handle the burnout any more.

970,Trading your waking hours for money sucks,"I'm 21 and I'm a telemarketer for an insurance agent making $9 an hour, part time. 

This shit is already fucking mentally exhausting, I just don't comprehend how people can do it for +40 hours a week. Seriously, I feel like I'm wasting my life away sitting in a fucking desk pretending that I'm working when my boss is in the office and pretending that I give a shit about the company. In the interview I asked him how much would he pay and he said $10 an hour, when I came to sign the offer he changed it to $9 an hour, plus commissions if I got a call that resulted in a sale..
$5 commissions... (are you fucking kidding me..) insurance gotta be the most difficult thing to sell cause I've been on this job for a month getting leads for my coworker who is actually licensed and he hasn't sold shit.

I've always been the entrepreneurial type, back in january of 2019 I closed on a wholesale real estate deal that made me $5,000 after a month of work, I never continued to do more deals because of the extreme stress, difficulty and effort that this took to accomplish. 

Fast forward 1 year, I'm now broke again and working for fucking $9/hr, I did the calculations and is going to take me 14 months of work to make the same amount I did in that real estate deal. I've already checked out mentally from this bullshit. I would rather work my ass off and get paid big money, at least I make my own hours.

Not only did they ignore me completely, they gave me the worst possible schedule for someone in my position. 2pm-10:30pm couldn't be a worse schedule for a dad.

987,Fuck work.,"This is me ranting, so if you're not into that, go no further. It will also feel like it's off-topic but bear with me.

I really love sweets. And ice cream. And chocolate. But most of all nougat chocolate. I've been eating that shit for as long as I can remember. I've also somehow managed not to turn into a giant nougat balloon. Over time, however, I've realized how bad sugar is for me.

And so I've been trying to get rid of my sweet tooth for some time. Nearing the end of the holidays, I had decided to stop. I had my last chocolate nougat bar a few hours before the new year. This is pretty much a new years resolution if you will.

The first day was kinda harsh. There certainly were cravings. But nothing too bad. And then there was the second day. Much easier. And the third. Again, a lot easier. Going shopping walking down the chocolate &amp; sweets aisle or whatever it's called didn't faze me. Everything was just fine. I could deal with it and was honestly wondering why I hadn't stopped earlier.

And then it was today. First day at work in the new year. Being at work - or more precisely, having to be at work - made me miserable. In instant. I felt miserable the whole day. And my work isn't even half as bad as what I read from most of you guys here. My coworkers are great. 2 of the 3 bosses are good, the third is bleh. The money I earn is good. But the work itself is so. Fucking. Pointless.

It makes me feel empty. Because I really couldn't care less. I'm one of the guys developing websites and web apps for other corporations which can then use that to earn money. Maybe I should be grateful, but I can't. It takes up my whole week every week and all I can think about is how I'm wasting the best hours of my life. And I can't enjoy my time off in the evening either. If I'm not totally exhausted I'm dreading having to go to bed and have it repeat again tomorrow.

Anyways, feeling as miserable as I did today, those sugary sweet horrible cravings hit me like a truck. It took everything I had to not just go and buy the next best piece of chocolate and swallow it whole. Just to make me feel better. Because what else is there?

And that's it. Work makes me feel miserable. That's why I'm so addicted to fucking sugar. It's one of the few things that balance out the misery. But of course, it comes with its own strain of misery. Slow, unhealthy, body-destroying misery.

The daily grind is destroying our souls. And to spare ourselves some pain we drown it out with alcohol and other drugs. Even something as simple as sugar. But that bites us in the ass in the long run, too.

988,Computer programming == fucking crap. Time to say it.,"I've always felt that one of the biggest LIES of the age, is the story of computer programming being a cool occupation.

It's not.

There were a few good years, ok, but those were mostly the years of my father (and I wasn't born yesterday either.)

In the end the man needed more drones to do it, and cheaper, and faster... that's all.

What mainstream programming today really is, is something possibly worse than mindless droning: programming is the **mindful** droning.

The average programmer is to be pictured as a biological extension of the computing machine. He usually doesn't even really know that well, let alone master, the inner workings of the machine: he's just another user of it. Contrary to popular belief, you don't even need long years of study to become a programmer, at all.

Software is eating the world, and we cannot have enough cheap young brains to sacrifice writing it: this is the plain truth, when devoided of all the careerism / passion-seeking / western society cultism etc.

Instead of staffing offices and creating bureaucracies, we make human brains write logic mazes for computers that reproduce the same functionality of groups of traditional workers.

To this day I pity, really pity, the poor young souls at the office who gladly subjected themselves to writing code all day. I know their plight fairly well, as obviously I am myself an IT guy.

The poor ""developers"" are under constant, unrelenting, forever pressure to produce, faster and faster, the product of their robotized minds... something that isn't even *theirs* as authors, like a book or other works of art would be. Instead, the line of code becomes company property the moment is typed.

The final product is at best an -albeit very glorified- unfinished piece of crap, that barely and miraculously *seems* to work, for now... and is basically a tool with a specific use in some extremely boring business context.

The ""dealing with idiots"" part is there too, inescapable: this aspect has engulfed almost all jobs, thanks to the ever-changing and almost extreme complexity of all things in our society.

1012,My idea on how change can be achieved,"I don't believe voting for the right political party can work. Not because ethical political parties don't exist, but because the wealthy people who control the current unethical parties are too powerful to let someone they don't like thanks charge. 

I don't have proof to support that there are powerful people who decide who gets to be president and who gets to pass laws, I just believe it from what I see. The few times someone who has honourable ethos actually becomes president, they are either killed, taken down by other means, or the changes they made are reverted as soon as they step down. Those who control the world have the power to put the people they want in the government and they also have power over through other means, like corrupted judges, police and military higher ups, etc,

If someone has proof or indication that the above isn't true, they are welcome to enlighten me.

Back to my point, the basis of their power is money. Through vast wealth they control almost everything.. except other wealthy people.

So in my head the only real way to counteract their wealth is with wealth. Wealthy individuals with honourable ethos needs to group up and push their own agenda, push their own candidates for presidents etc. They can also focus on using their wealth to improve humanity wellbeing in other ways, like nonprofit humanitarian aid, fighting climate change etc.

Wealthy people with honourable ethos might sound impossible for some people but I don't think that's true. Again I don't have proof, I just feel it's actually impossible that there aren't any ethical corporations that treat their workers as best as they can. Ask yourself, if you were the wealthy owner of a business, would you not treat your employees as best as you could? I know I would, I can't be the only one.

Also don't forget, we live in an era where a lot of people make loads of money from YouTube, blogs, etc, ways that don't have workers to take advantage of.

So, if you ask me, you should probably focus on achieving wealth and using it to better our world. Although, personal exploration, expression and freedom do come first, so try to build wealth in a way that fulfills you, and that's probably the best way to achieve wealth. 

I understand that we live in suffocating times, but I believe there also more opportunities than ever.

And I’d see people with jobs at Apple or in entertainment or somewhere “cool” being celebrated. But after taking a few of those jobs I can easily say these are some of the most exploitative jobs I’ve ever had.

1021,Stepping up to a role with higher responsibility,"So, I am working as a Business Analyst and ours is a medium size firm and we are understaffed in a lot of departments. My boss has been asking me to ""step up"" and assume more responsibilities (i.e. take up a line management/project management role) as it would impact how they plan out my career development and offer me raises and promotions in the long run (i.e. entice the slave with some carrots) 

I said my thanks for the consideration but NO to the offer. One reason I gave is project management and business analyst are two different skill sets and I am already over stretched with the tasks I have as it is so taking on more work will end up in me underperforming in both the areas. 

Secondly my role, salary and hours of work are what I have been signed on for as a part of my contract and I am not ambitious to develop my career for promotions I am not interested in and skills I don't have any inclination to develop (I'd rather love to progress as a senior business analyst at some point in future i.e a few years before I retire and till then continue the same work I have been doing)

The above two reasons are incompatible with the ""real life situations"" with work because you never get to work on things you enjoy working on and end up doing a crap load of work that you have no heart and will to do. I am sure my refusal will come up in the annual appraisal discussions (which is another story altogether) and I will be told that I am ""inflexible"", ""siloed"", ""not a leader"" etc but fuck all that. 

The mantra with all organisations is the same :

1. Hire resources and overstretch them with work 
2. Fire resources and add additional work on the resources that are left
3. Of the resources that are left identify the ones which are relatively good in work/desperate for money and entice them to step up and take in additional roles 
4. Ask nicely, if they say yes, battle is won and load them with more work. If they say no , bring it up in annual appraisal and force them to take up the additional work by indirectly giving an indication they will be let go
5. The good/desperate employee reluctantly takes the additional responsibilities, gets stressed , is unable to perform and loses whatever little motivation is left and starts looking for other jobs

1027,I'm only 21 and I already had my first breakdown because of work,"I live in Italy and I'm currently working in an office with 5 other woman who are 40+ of age (I'm a male).

I'm finding really hard because it's 50km away from home so it takes me about an hour just to get there, I really don't like the job and I also really don't like my colleagues. I've been working here for about 3 months.

Before I used to work for the same company but at a structure that was like 3km from home, and I also had a different job (which I liked, as the colleagues).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, long story short, just before the Xmas holidays my boss sent me a Whatsapp message saying that I'm not good enough and she won't tolerate the my overall performance anymore. So that basically ruined my holidays but I tried not to think about it.

Today I went back to work and, as expected, I got called into my boss's office. 

She started telling me I'm not good, I make the office look bad, if I make a mistake then it's more work for the office and because of this I create a bad atmosphere between the colleagues. Things like this.

She also had the cheek to tell me that I had a choice (since I'm still living with my parents), I don't pay any bills yet and stuff like that. But I was practically forced into this job, here in Italy it's hard to find something and I need to help my mum and dad who aren't financially well off.

The discussion ended with my boss telling me that we'll see how it goes until the end of next week and talk again. I had a little breakdown in the bathroom because all of this kind of came out of the blue.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my assignments are ultimately trivial, and I would learn a lot better (and be more motivated to learn) if I wasn’t required to complete meaningless assignments. I hate that there seems to be an expectation that I need to value school work above all else, but more than that I hate that I have fallen into that trap. There are people smarter than me, but I’m by no means a slacker - my intention isn’t to brag, but I have a 4.7 GPA. I work hard. Working this hard has taken a toll on my physical and mental health though, and that’s by far the worst part. I feel sick because I stay up late at night and forgo sleep to finish my assignments.

I don't believe life, who we are is the sum of being a slave to an employer or a benefit system.

It is absolute bullshit to force people into work when a significant proportion of the population were born into a situation where they never had to care about it because they were born into money.

What I've learnt is there are also a lot of highly paid 60+ hour workers who are just as stupid as forcing everyone to do pointless work. Once you get past a certain income level you could chuck it in, shove your money in savings and live off of that.

Does the Queen work? no. Does anyone in the Royal Family in the UK really 'work'? No. Not like forced to. And that's simply an accident of birth.

Fuck this life of the rich trying to make you suck their assholes to make them feel better about themselves.

Find yourself, find your dreams, keep speaking your truth

Great reading everything you all post

Something for Thought: Surely with all the riches the rich own, if they really thought about it, if they really wanted to that could give what would be a relatively small amount to them to someone to live without being 'forced' to work. They wouldn't even have to give it - they could make the interest from it in a bank account and give it to someone who wasn't born into their situation. It'd be no sniff to them. With all the money in the world and resources we have, I'm sure this could be done if people accepted a basic standard of living and a few niceties. Get rid of greed. Live from only what you need. Pool together for cheaper food, help each other find the cheapest deals. This would all be possible with a caring, loving society that wants to flourish and help everyone follow their best path.

Also, animals: they don't work. They hunt for food, thats it. We're animals really. Yes we're expected to follow rules laws, most people rarely do this and its only these that hold them accountable. The rich don't follow rules or laws. Their money helps them stay clear of them or buy their way out of it when they fuck up.

Capitalism is bullshit. We need some serious changes in life, for starters booting out all the narccistics and rich dickheads who go about encouraging this system because it makes them feel good about themselves. That's all it is.

When the world starts to become about good character rather than just making money, the right people will be around to make the world better and we can ostracise the people who have no morals, who don't give a damn. It's clear most of the rich don't give one, because remember they need the poor to be rich.

I would seriously like to start a uk group with meetups. I really struggle with my own personal struggles daily so this may be a push for me. We need to see some siginifcant changes in this lifetime to stop the suicide rate - but honestly I'm starting to think its on purpose. We're overpopulated, and if you've ever read anything about narccistic abuse well thats what they want. If you're poor, struggling, not finding ways to be happy then the rich get off on you dying. Stay alive, find ways forward, best find ways to find you be above this system that defines you and who you are by a paycheck and a job and find a way to be happy. That will piss them off the most.

To be clear I believe in keeping busy, doing things you love, being productive and helping others when you can. I believe in doing these in a way that best supports you, not being exhausted, keeping fit and healthy and not being forced in a kafka esque way to do. It's unnatural and disgusting to expect another human being to do anything really productive with a finger and a camera pointed at them all day scrutinising them for the benefit of the ego of another. I also believe in the value and serenity of doing nothing.

Which I tend not to, leading to things like me yelling at you when you interrupt me while I'm talking.

It's fucking stupid that I'm supposed to care about the company ""losing money"" when I don't make enough to live on my own, get no benefits, and the Galaxy Business Brains at corporate ordered you whip-crackers to cut my hours to deal with a dip in sales that happens literally every winter yet still leaves the company with billions (I work at a hardware store chain, the blue one).

That's not your problem? Never said it was, wouldn't be one at all if you'd find something better to do. But thanks for putting that ""We're family, here!"" nonsense to bed.

I do take long breaks. Because there's nothing to do after 2 hours, and pretending to be busy under said condition is also fucking stupid. There's only so many trash cans to be taken out, floors to sweep and shopping carts to recover.

But whatever, you win. I need a job with a shift that lets me struggle to focus and remember things in a networking class at trade school, so I'll just scarf down a shit sandwich for breakfast instead. Won't need to microwave it, so I can probably slam it just before I clock in. Speaking of eating shit, do you put sauce on the ceo's shoes or do you prefer your dog turds plain? 

Now stop talking to me and let me toil in autopilot while daydreaming about automation taking most people's jobs, leading to either the time of my life or just dying higher than a runaway balloon in Denver, knowing that I won't miss anything.

1058,It's a small thing but...,"I work for a large, well-known Christian charity (although not Christian myself, which makes every official meeting awkward as fuck because we're expected to participate in prayers and devotionals. Also being a bi butch woman when this charity is well known for their transphobia and homophobia is fun). I'm a groundskeeper, I enjoy the work, my supervisor is a pretty decent, understanding guy with a thorough dislike for the shit that comes with capitalism. He's straight up told me to prioritize myself over this company, because no company will care for my health. 

But without fail, I'm consistently getting fucked over by his boss (the supervisor for our department and the same department at another building) who has no real conception of what our building needs. We all consistently get dicked around by him endlessly.

So in this last week, he moved one of our two custodians to the other building, decided we only need one custodian (when 2 could barely manage to stay on top of everything), and told us that we as a department need to share the remaining custodial responsibilities. Shit sucks, but alright. 

With that change, they decided to list a job posting for a second maintenance person, despite our current guy having pretty much everything covered. Another change that makes 0 fucking sense, but I'm not the big boss so what the hell do I know? 

As a groundskeeper, I'm responsible for snow removal. Which means I need to be here before the building opens, in order to clear the entrances and parking lots. Previously I was in at 7, but the maintenance guy made an issue because he has young kids and is a single father, so he needs to be home when they're off school. I get bumped to coming in at 8, which makes my job harder when the maintenance guy doesn't help with snow, but I understand and don't have an issue helping him out.

I come in today though to find that I'm now working the custodial shift (930-6, which means parking lots won't be cleared, entrances might be, but we're most likely gonna be getting complaints because things aren't done in time. And despite everything, those complaints will be reflecting on me directly). With the added bonus of working the custodial evening shift (1-930) on Fridays, and covering Friday events (which we're supposed to alternate covering, but I've been working every one of them for months).

Today, I've been assigned cleaning duties on top of snow removal. The maintenance guy is doing his usual stuff. So the whole ""sharing custodial duties"" is yet to happen.

I suspect that rather than actually sharing these duties, they're being pushed onto me, and when the new maintenance person is hired, they'll be taking over snow removal mainly (and it'll be pretty likely that the new person is a guy, just statistically speaking). So I've been corralled into being a custodian by the looks of it, without so much as a ""do you mind helping out?"".

The other day the maintenance guy said to me that ""it'll be good if you do more cleaning. Snow removal is hard, especially for a female. This will make it easy on you"". Nevermind the fact that I've been doing an excellent job IMO of staying on top of this massive property with very little help (despite the fact that he's supposed to help me). I don't really want to make a stink about this comment, he and I get along well (aside from this), English isn't his first language, and he comes from a very traditional country. Trying to explain why benevolent sexism is an issue is hard normally, with these added factors I think it'll just lead to an argument that I don't feel like having. Not to mention; cleaning isn't fucking easy. 

I'm not making an issue of the shift change yet. Tbf I did ask my supervisor if he could change my shift because driving in rush hour doubles my drive time, which I can't afford the gas for. But if I start being told to do more custodial, I'm going to make an issue. Aside from the maintenance guy's comment, no one has said anything about me being female making me better at cleaning (lmao he should see my house, he'd change his mind). But I feel as though it's being heavily implied, and I'm being pushed out of my position and into custodial because I'm female.

On top of all this; they pay minimum wage, and/or far below the average for these positions. Most people who work here end up using the services they provide to low income people. I'm consistently short every month. And during Christmas, they had the audacity to all but demand we volunteer for their charity drive because that's where they make all their money. All this while my big boss can afford to go to Europe for a month.... But we're supposed to grit our teeth and be grateful that we work for a company with such a great mission to help the poor. They sell us this idea, and I'll admit for a while I was proud to help out. But now I realized that the more people who use their services, the more grants they can qualify for. They're keeping us in poverty so they can continue making the big bucks.

I'm going for surgery at the end of the month. I'll be off for two months for recovery. My province is in a pretty big recession, and just lost a shit ton of jobs thanks to our new shit head corporate shill government. My plan was to find a new job in that time, but it's looking more and more like I'll be stuck here. These bastards don't even offer short term disability. I was told my sick days are my ""insurance""..... Which is great and all, for someone who never gets sick. That's not me.

I don't know if I should even bother making an issue about this or not. Because if I bring up how sexist it is to force the only woman doing a ""man's job"" (as the previous custodian described my position) into cleaning, they can wriggle out of it pretty easy because nothing was *directly* said about it.

1067,"Article: ""Lonneke (32) is well educated, childless and works part-time: ""I don't want to work more than 3 days, period.""","[Original article in Dutch.](https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/amp/item/lonneke-32-is-hoogopgeleid-kinderloos-en-parttimer-ik-wil-niet-meer-dan-3-dagen-werken-punt/?__twitter_impression=true)

Google traslation below (cause i didn't feel like translating everything myself).

I really don't understand how this is such a radical thing to do? People seem baffled by the idea of working less. Why?

&gt;Lonneke (32) is well educated, childless and works parttime: “I don’t want to work more than 3 days, period.”

&gt;She is well educated, has no kids and is young. Still, Lonneke Backelandt works only three days a week. Simply because it makes her happy. “I’ve become a more fun person because of this.”

&gt;It is one of the discussions in which the minds often run high: the fact that so many women work part-time in the Netherlands. Especially since there are more and more economists who state that we simply cannot afford this anymore with all the shortages in healthcare and education.

&gt;**Sensitivity**

&gt;Lonneke understands the sensitivity around this theme like no other. Still, a few years ago she chose to work less. ""I have to defend myself very often for my choice.""

&gt;Despite her financial independence, the candidate civil-law notary must regularly explain her conscious choice. ""Also because I am not a mother, or for example have to take care of a sick family member. I want to invest my time in myself. That seems to me to be my right.""

&gt;**Firm burnout**

&gt;The reason for her choice is also that she ended up in a serious burn-out a few years ago as an aspiring notary. ""I then decided to change my life and decided to put it on the table as a hard requirement. Work no more than 3 days, period.""

&gt;Her employer was certainly not immediately enthusiastic when she submitted this proposal. ""They really had to get used to it. How are we going to set it up? And who is going to set it up? And who is going to do all that work? That kind of questions I got. It certainly requires an adjustment and not every employer is geared for that.""

&gt;**Better concentration**

&gt;Her current employer eventually tacks. Lonneke still reaps the benefits of her decision every day. ""I really notice that I have become a much happier and more fun person. I don't do fewer things in my life, but with a much better concentration.""

&gt;Lonneke wants to tell her story to make others think. ""A lot of women, but also men are stuck in a kind of mold that makes them not happy at all. Why is man made just to work, eat and sleep? There is much more to life.""

&gt;**""9 to 5 is really outdated""**

&gt;She also thinks that there is much more open discussion in other countries about what is a good balance between private life and work. ""For example, look at Denmark. They've got a shorter working week. It is really outdated that everyone should only work from 9 to 5. Is really not necessarily efficient for everyone.""",False,ekswjt,FruitKnuist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ekswjt/article_lonneke_32_is_well_educated_childless_and/,6,1

1092,Notice how workplaces want to make the most out of the working day yet only give you the least amount of annual leaves?,"I made a similar comment to this a few weeks ago to an AskReddit post but unfortunately didn't get any traction (nobody else really contributed lol). This is probably quite flawed but hope you can see what I mean...

So anyway, to elaborate on the title, in many countries there is typically law that specifies the minimum number of hours an employee must work per week to be considered full-time, as well as a maximum number of hours worked before overtime pay comes into play. In the US, if you work 30 hours per week, apparently the IRS considers you a full time employee and the Department of Labor requires overtime pay for any work over 40 hours...

Same goes for annual leave. There's usually a law on the minimum number of days an employee must be granted every year, something between 10-20 days for a lot of countries.

Here's the thing: notice how pretty much all places of work requires you to work 8 hours everyday for a total of 40 hours per week yet you're only granted the minimum number of annual leaves per year? 

The places we work for are willing get away with as much as they can on us. I bet you if we didn't get overtime pay until after 10 hours (while still getting paid the same amount as when we work 8), most companies won't hesitate to make 10-hour days the standard number of hours we must work everyday.

Of course, I'm not talking about all companies. There are probably few great ones that grant 6 hour work days with 40-hour workweek pay as well as being very generous with their annual leaves, but I think I have a better chance of dating that cute girl I saw at the mall if I asked her out as soon as I meet her than finding a company like that...",False,ekjqe2,Zlint,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ekjqe2/notice_how_workplaces_want_to_make_the_most_out/,1,1

1096,Tech Companies are the worst.,"I'm currently working at a major site for a major tech company (if you search cringe post history you'll know which one, don't want to post it here) 
And a ton of their practices are absolutely horrible.

For starters they literally have employee segregation everywhere between full time employees and contractors. The full time employees are actually told they are better than us and they act accordingly. Most offices I've worked in the past have very loose rules on things but not here. Let me list a few 

1) food left in common areas is for employees only. If you are seen eating it you can be fired 

2) areas of the building are off limits to use to contractors but yet I'm a contractor and work in the room I'm not allowed to use 

3) any social club, after work event, party etc. Is for full time employees only.

4) no benefits whatsoever. I tried to apply for my contract companies insurance but it was actually 25% of my income for insurance that wasn't good.

5) and this is my biggest gripe, the company shuts down for the last 2 weeks of December and all non salary employees loose 2 weeks of pay for the holidays. Making paying bills incredibly difficult for 75% of their employees.

I'm sorry for the rant but these companies are getting away legally with these practices and it's awful.",False,ekh7gx,met4life,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ekh7gx/tech_companies_are_the_worst/,6,1

1099,An escape from this hell,"Alright, sometime around May of 2023 I’m planning on heading way out into Alaska and squatting in the wilderness. I hunt and fish and trap, I’m decent with building and crafting things, I am decent and getting better at identifying wild edible plants. I’ve been doing shit like this since I was young. It’s what I like. It’s not easy and I feel as though a lot of the anti work community is just not disciplined and feels defeated by the system. It’s natural, I feel this way too a lot, but I’m doing something about it. 





Doing so alone is definetly dangerous, and humans are social creatures, not meant to live alone in the woods. I’m looking for a small group of people to do this with me. I’m doing it no matter what, it’s been a dream since early childhood. 





It’s best that you aren’t too old, much over 30 isn’t ideal. Obviously being extremely fat isn’t good, but an ideal physical state isn’t neccessary should someone possess determination and grit. Serious physical health problems are a no. You don’t need extensive experience in the woods to make this happen. A fair bit of intelligence and common sense, yes. A basic amount of gear, yes.

Since I've put in my notice my mindset has drifted back and forth with thoughts like: 

""find something part time and take your time with finding something permanent.""

""I probably need to take some time off before looking at this field again"" 

""I'm not sure I should ever work in this field again.""

As Oxford attracts the best talent from across the world, I was having mixed thoughts about feeling envious on one hand that I attended a mediocre college with mediocre experoences and relief on the other hand that leaving aside taking so much debt to study in these colleges, working hard day and night for a couple of years and only ending up to work for the capitalists is not something I would be keen to do.

Very few people from these top colleges have an entrepreneurial bent of mind who start their own ventures or enjoy what they do while most end up working in jobs (of course with much fatter pay packages).

Would you choose attending such prestigious colleges and embark on higher education knowing for a fact that you would still be a cog in the wheel of wage slavery (maybe a higher package for a few years will help you retire earlier) or would you not be interested to fall in the  enticement of studying so hard and would rather just graduate from anywhere (maybe you believe degrees are just a piece of paper and ultimately you cannot buy freedom no matter where you graduate from)?",False,eiijty,horseshoemagnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eiijty/do_you_believe_in_the_power_of_high_quality/,3,1

1138,40 hours work week is a lie (rant),"So you hear the ""Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest and eight hours for what you will"" thrown around for here and there as if the 40 hour work week is the optimal balance between work and leisure, but it doesn't account for a few things.


* 8 hours sleep every night (disturbed sleep I might add due to being woken by an alarm clock)


* 2,5 hours of spare time before work with a cloud of anxiety hanging over them


* 3,5 hours going to and from work


* 8 hour work day


11,5-14 hours a day are dedicated to or else ruined by work. So you might as well really just strike the whole work week off as work. That leaves the weekends where 12 hours of rest might sound reasonable since c'mon I'm not using a fucking alarm clock on my time off.


That leaves 24 hours of spare time in a 104 hour week (subtracted the amount of sleep from 168).

1145,Age 37. Some perspective and lessons learned.,"I have experienced it all. Over a dozen jobs, 3 different career paths, hunger, cold, homelessness. Clinical depression, loss, and years of isolation. All of this with Asperger's.

I have learned some truths that those who have not experienced my situation do not. First of all, work is not optional unless you are born into money. Most jobs involve working only to make enough to pay rent, food, commute, and self-maintenance, which means absolutely nothing left for anything else.

Work in 2019 is more akin to slavery for most people on earth. Most countries have more vacant homes than they do homeless people (you can google that), and most countries produce more food than can be consumed by people.

Yet, the world is still made to struggle. The rich are slowly increasing their life expectancy while average people die at the same ages they did 20 years ago. All governments are actively consolidating power over their citizens to make them better and more desperate workers. Healthcare is closely tied to your job almost everywhere. Your Boss is allowed to tell you what you can and cannot say and what you can and cannot do in your personal life outside of work. people get fired for it all the time, especially social networking.

It starts with schools. Schools force kids to get out of bed early in the morning against their will and then sit in a facility all day, being told what to do and learning subservience and giving up control of their days to other people, preparing them for a lifetime of servitude to the 1%.

Got into a huge fight with my boyfriend first thing this morning so that didn't help the crying. Had to go into work, had another breakdown about it. Came in and what I was there to do was cancelled today so I asked if I could go home, which they told me to help the others instead. I said something like 'ah dang, okay.'

1155,Quitting after a month,"So I started a new job a month ago. On the first day, I knew I would hate it. It’s in human services. Each day, I have had to rationalize why I am keeping it. I want to quit and be gone by next week. I am under extreme stress each minute that I am employed there. The people who work there are catty and love to gossip. It is extremely toxic and has made me profoundly depressed. The position that I currently hold is group based; essentially, if my coworkers do not do their part, it is nearly impossible for me to satisfy my job duties. 

I have been walking on eggshells around my coworkers because of how they conduct themselves. I planned on staying on the company for at least a year to gain experience. 

I know you are supposed to do a two week notice but I don’t think I can handle the stress. What excuses have you guys provided employers in the past for why you are leaving (if you couldn’t do a two week notice)?",False,eimxzf,zedconus,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eimxzf/quitting_after_a_month/,14,1
1156,They want me to be happy about it too.,My post yesterday and some replies I got got me thinking. So not only am I supposed to submit to being a glorified slave. But on top of that the defenders of this system expect me to be happy about it too?! What the fuck kind of bullshit is that? No I will not be happy about not doing what I want in life. And no I can't get a job doing what I love.

How do we all avoid spiraling into debilitating depression from a meaningless life under capitalism?","None of the interests I have really translate into a profitable career and I'm feeling so lost on what to do. I'm probably going to just settle for studying something tech or IT related if I can, but my anxiety/panic attacks are a huge barrier to me holding down a job, too; I quit my last food service job because of it. But I have to work. Now I'm looking at probably having to stick it out again at another food service job while going to school for a ""better"" job that I don't even know if I'll be able to do or want to do, and the thought just has me so bummed out.",False,eit43o,1aur,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eit43o/so_uh_how_do_we_all_avoid_spiraling_into/,29,1
1160,Overheard in cafe just now,"Parents talking to their daughter about life. The mother's advice is she has to work her ass off in her program to get a job. And that her (the mother's)  whole generation was depressed and that it's normal. 

The kid looked so sad and defeated. Wish I had an alternate path. I couldn't tell how old she was and the mother looked insane.

Sounded like she was in medicine. Mentioned the cost of a broken arm is just some made up number and doesn't reflect the true cost. The mother was like, ""yeah, so what?""

Just wish we had a solution so I could pass her a business card sized info on how to escape this BS. Or where to turn to for help. :/",False,eimnff,Reuben3901,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/eimnff/overheard_in_cafe_just_now/,80,1
1161,Please tell me if I'm am idiot or not,"I have been unemployed for over a month and just can't go back to work. I missed multiple interviews and just don't call back if I do get a call. The thought of working even 30 hours a week for a shit job makes me physically ill but I don't have the documentation to get SSDI.

Anyway, I went down a rabbit hole last night. It started with dropshipping then FBA selling. Then an automated Amazon business. But there's a catch (well, there's a lot):

1. I'd need a 40K personal loan and they only do wire transfers because taking credit makes them ""high risk"". They only registered with the BBB in July but I can't find any negative reviews and they've been taking customers for about a year. They're in Canada, too.

2. They also charge $125/ week or $500/ month for 2 months initially for employee costs to start the store.

3. They require at least $10K credit line for inventory. I only have a $5K line and a $1K line that are currently paid off. I haven't done the phone screening yet but someone else told me you need a pretty high credit line to turn better and faster profits, closer to $20K is better.

4. The store owner is projected to net 8-20% of the revenue after 4-6 months and then the company only takes a 30% fee after 3 months. The inventory is always put on the store owner's credit card as it's their product.

5. Your store is supposed to make $100K revenue/ month after 12 months so between $10-20K passive income a month after that.

The company is Valiant Consultants by Steven Mayer if anyone has made it this far. He's on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, and there are a few articles as well. No bad reviews but again, it's a new company. He's also endorsed by Grant Cardone but I only heard that name yesteday.",False,ej1a11,MFrealGs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ej1a11/please_tell_me_if_im_am_idiot_or_not/,14,1
