2,“It’s for your personal career development”,my work is sending me on some once a week training course for three months  where i get to learn about pointless shit that i don t care about such as new ways to write reports  learning from  industry experts  and  expanding my personal contact network  i protested that i wasn t interested in going but was informed it s mandatory as  part of my personal career development plan   please  please  please will you stop making me do this inane bullshit  i do not care about any of this  or my  personal career development  i just want to do my 8 9 hours with as little stress as possible and then go home  hell  if it was up to me i wouldn t even do that  working for you is not some radical new lifestyle choice i m embracing to revolutionise my life - it s a necessary evil for me to pay rent   when and how did this become the acceptable norm  who is coming up with these pointless jobs for people who s sole responsibility is just to conjure up pointless new training schemes to fuck up other employees lives and waste their time ,8dqlm2

5,"We reject work and build an anti-work society, then what?",please  don't misunderstand my question  i'm as anti-work as it gets  but i am concerned about the possibilities of social reproduction of the basic necessities of people  i know that  with current technology  we could reduce the workforce a lot  but we still would need some organization in the transitional phase to full automation  which could last centuries    how would people handle this  would they really do it  work  for themselves  provided we make conditions as fair as possible of course  would we still need some coercion  should we use incentives  all of this is tricky because it reproduces the social logic of capital  productive ideologies  appraisal of the working man  etc  etc  but it's just that i think we have to use a gradual approach even today  ,8fv8th
