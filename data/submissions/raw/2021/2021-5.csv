5,Work Should be a Choice For Extras,"Every person born has the right to a good life.  Instead we have a society where four billion people live in poverty, 2 billion work every day just to survive, one billion work 40+ years to have a few years of retirement and a few hundred thousand live in total luxury.  

What we need is a universal basic package.  Humanity has the means to pay for this, why aren't we doing it!  What I think the basic package should include:

1.  Housing with a minimum of 400 sq ft. per person in the household.  e.g. a couple gets 800 sq ft. A family of 4 gets 1600 sq ft.  Air Conditioning and Heat provided based on the location.
2.  Clean Water
3.  Basic Food - Rice, Beans, Bread, Eggs, Milk, Spices, etc.
4. Cookware - plates, glasses, sporks, pots and pans, stove, oven, etc.
5. Utilities - Gas and Electric
6. Basic Furniture - Couch, Chairs, Tables, Beds
7. Clothing
8. Gym Membership or Exercise Equipment - this will pay for itself with a healthier population
9. Transportation - I think the form of transportation depends where you live (e.g. City metro pass, minivan for family, pickup truck for work) but up to $3k a year/year for getting around is easily doable.
10. Education - Kindergarten through College should be paid for, its the students right at the end to decide if they want to pursue working for somebody else or use their education to focus on their own life.
11. Information Technology and Entertainment - Basic TV/Internet package so humans can share information with each other and share cultural experiences (e.g. movies, shows, sports games, etc).
12. 1 educational vacation per household per year.  I don't think on a basic package you should be going to Disneyworld, but maybe to the beach to learn about the effects of plastics pollutions in our oceans or to Europe to gain a better understanding of the horrors of the Holocaust.

Things I don't think should be in the basic package:

1. Video Games
2. Meat
3. Eating Out
4. Air or Aquatic Vehicles
5. Alcohol or Marijuana
6. Movie or sports tickets
7. Premium Cable - you need to pay if you want Faux News!

So in my plan everybody gets the basic package and then if you want to add on to that, you can go out and get a job for those things.  This way you're not having to worry about working to pay the rent or making sure the power stays on.  You are working for the extras like a PS5 or a night out with the family.",False,noj5x6,stockstar1138,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/noj5x6/work_should_be_a_choice_for_extras/,31,1

8,Keep Dying Troops,"Keep dying troops.

No respect or support for any military of any nation.  No respect or support for brainless thieves &amp; thugs.

Whenever some military idiot loses a life or limb they lose it for their own nonsense, not me.

* Military/Soldiers do not protect freedom of movement or freedom of transportation; see Covid 19 lockdown and travel restrictions, etc.


* Military/Soldiers do not protect freedom of speech; see content removal and account suspension/termination terms of forums such as Reddit, Discord, Facebook, etc., see restriction of speech in court rooms, etc., see restriction of speech and action in retail business, etc.


* Military/Soldiers do not protect against corporate or government affluence.  In fact, military assists the activities of domineering corporations and governments.


Military did not thwart 9/11.  Military is not securing your liberty.

In theory military ensures liberty, in theory military defends a populace from invasion or intrusion (see 9/11).  In practice military is a global cabal extorting the world populace through threat of violence.

The guy over there, supposedly threatening us, is the same guy over here, supposedly threatening them.  It's all brainless nonsense to extort money and resources through fear.

Military employees can't get real jobs so they twirl weapons around and extract money from the populace through ambiguous threat of violence.  It's the same everywhere.  It's a racket.

World leaders won't change the scheme, world leaders benefit as they use military to help extract money from the populace.  World leaders use military to bully the rest of the populace to their advantage.  On a global scale.

Those with the guns, uniforms and badges are using threat of violence to control and extort you.

Grow up.

Get rid of the idiots.

Stop stealing our money, thieves.

12,"The Pandemic Panic/Global Reset, Reminder of your Manipulation &amp; Enslavement","The Corona panic, the Global Reset as many are calling it is a sign of your enslavement.

Let's review what all occurred during the pandemic or Great Reset:

* Virtual global lockdown

* Authoritative management and handling of the world populace to mitigate a virus; near iron-clad lockdown of the world populace along with reinforcement of obedience to authority.  The entire world cooperated, even Koreans wore the masks, at the command of global leadership.

* Controversial/Oppositional internet content was targeted and removed from major platforms i.e. Youtube:

Alex Jones

David Icke

Stephan Molyneux

Jason Goodman

Red Pill Philosophy

Various New World Order Channels/Documentaries, etc.
 

The ideas may be debatable, but the point here is that opposition is being targeted and eliminated.  Government and corporate interests are managing information in order to control the narrative, in order to secure control and influence over the flocks of people.

These same administrations which brought the world together for the pandemic are the same administrations facilitating military, war and conflict, they are the same administrations wasting lives and resources with such systems, with weaponry and military.  If those in charge can compel cooperation and unity why are they allowing wasteful, mindless military?  Why are they allowing and preparing for conflict?  While at the same time meticulously monitoring your internet actions and activities?  Because it is a game.  You are being manipulated, you are being played, you are being managed like cattle, like football players, to the profit and advantage of those in charge.

**The Great Reset is the Great Reminder of your enslavement.**

**How is this Antiwork relevant?**  It affects your workload.  Global military and the division it perpetuates wastes time, money, energy and resources.  Since military employees are not building houses, supplying food, stocking shelves, etc., they are creating an environment in which others must work more, others must do those things and must compensate for the nonproductive military employees.

Military does not and cannot ensure our freedom.  We are subject to compulsory taxation, proliferating laws and legality, conscription, and an overbearing, demanding and laborous work environment.  World government was able to lock down the entire planet, restricting everyone's freedom, destroying business, and no one was able to do anything about it.  That is not liberty.

**Global leadership has now demonstrated its ability to compel global cooperation and global action.  World leaders could likewise act to dissolve military, they could then transition that personnel to real jobs such as construction, food, agriculture, healthcare, etc., and lighten the workload and shorten the work week for every person worldwide.  But they do not.  Hold world leaders accountable.  They are taking our money after all.  At best they are incompetent, at worst deceptive thieves.**",False,npikku,DumbSlaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/npikku/the_pandemic_panicglobal_reset_reminder_of_your/,0,1

39,I got told to “just work two jobs” today,"I posted a few weeks ago about my inability to find a job that pays me enough to subsist and pay all of my bills. For clarification, my resume is solid and I have a bachelors. Still, no one wants to hire me. Now, this is what it is. Not much I can do about it. But I was speaking with a family member about it and complaining that our system is messed up. She retorts, “well you could pay all of your bills if you had two jobs, so you should just have a main job then a part time or full time job on the side to make up for it”.

46,My company's latest retention scheme to stop people from leaving,"So because employees have been leaving due to shit ass management and lack of proper direction, the managers came up with an ultra innovative strategy which sucks ass especially because it's shit pay and it comes with a billion terms and conditions.

You get paid a certain amount as bonus now, after 1st year, and after 2nd year. It's not some extraordinary amount, mind you. About 2 months of extra pay which is not much after taxes. And apparently this is some extra generous deed that you have to keep it a ""secret"". Oh no!

So what are the terms.
- eligible only if you haven't submitted your termination notice before the agreement. Fair enough.
- you can't leave the company within that year. If you do leave then you will have to pay the amount back for that year. LOL. Like I can totally see legal issues chasing you even after you decide to leave the company and paying back a few bucks short. Also they don't mention if you should return amount before or after the taxation. Red alert.
- Eligible only if you perform well and get a good score above a threshold in your performance analysis. LOL. It''s them that decide what score you get. If you get lower score they stop all subsequent payments. I can totally see them increasing the already high workload expectations just so you will fight harder to get that score for that beautiful compensation. Like I've been in this company for majority of my career and still I have to ""prove"" myself that I deserve that amount of money they're so generously giving away. 
- you can't be on leave for some amount of consecutive days. This is easy. Everyone knows you can plan illnesses or injuries for the coming 3years. Otherwise even if you work well before and after that rest period you still won't get the money. Fuck you ROFL manage your illnesses better.

Also if I get that money it'll be spent soon or invested somewhere and it would be more trouble to pay it back if I decide to leave because they don't realise that unlike them people don't have deep cash reserves sitting in offshore bank accounts. You'd have to keep that cash untouched because God forbid if you have to leave due to some unforeseen circumstances.

They don't understand that employees leaving makes THEM worthless. So I don't get the point that they still determine our worth with their expectations. It's not really a goodwill gesture if it's accompanied by so much legal terms.

I also can totally see them paying less annual bonus or salary rise because this extra amount has to be deducted somewhere from our own paychecks. But of course none of this would be mentioned in the agreement.

Fuck that. I'm not signing that and creating more trouble for myself. That agreement actually made me decide that I should leave soon so no point in taking it and paying back. Good luck to anyone that signs it.",False,np4ps9,bjdomshux,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/np4ps9/my_companys_latest_retention_scheme_to_stop/,5,3

Today I sent in my constructive discharge letter to my job, I'm about to go into litigation with my job and it feels like a break up. I loved my job and I learned a lot. For about a year I had suffered sexism and abuse from my employer. I'm not sure why but I feel bad about resigning, I had to take a stress leave because the abuse from my employer caused me seizures , even on the job. I am happy that I am going to be compensated for all of the days I worked overtime without pay and for the abuse and humiliation from my supervisor. But on the flip side I am upset because it's hard to find a similar job because of my gender. I can read schematics and am great at building rapport with customers but I'm afraid that now in an already ""boys club"" industry ( air compressors) it's going to be difficult to get back in. Even customers refuse to speak to female technicians despite me and my female colleagues having more schooling then out male counterparts. Generally, if we get a call, they place them on hold and ask me and my female coworker what to do next even though we are paid less. I am surprised that in 2021 we have to deal with this.

54,"The Pandemic Panic/Global Reset, a Reminder of your Manipulation &amp; Enslavement","The Corona panic, the Global Reset as many are calling it is a sign of your enslavement.

Let's review what all occurred during the pandemic or Great Reset:

* Virtual global lockdown

* Authoritative management and handling of the world populace to mitigate a virus; near iron-clad lockdown of the world populace along with reinforcement of obedience to authority.  The entire world cooperated, even Koreans wore the masks, at the command of global leadership.

* Controversial/Oppositional internet content was targeted and removed from major platforms i.e. Youtube:

Alex Jones

David Icke

Stephan Molyneux

Jason Goodman

Red Pill Philosophy

Various New World Order Channels/Documentaries, etc.
 

The ideas may be debatable, but the point here is that opposition is being targeted and eliminated.  Government and corporate interests are managing information in order to control the narrative, in order to secure control and influence over the flocks of people.

These same administrations which brought the world together for the pandemic are the same administrations facilitating military, war and conflict, they are the same administrations wasting lives and resources with such systems, with weaponry and military.  If those in charge can compel cooperation and unity why are they allowing wasteful, mindless military?  Why are they allowing and preparing for conflict?  While at the same time meticulously monitoring your internet actions and activities?  Because it is a game.  You are being manipulated, you are being played, you are being managed like cattle, like football players, to the profit and advantage of those in charge.

**The Great Reset is the Great Reminder of your enslavement.**

Why is this Antiwork relevant?  Because it affects your workload.  Global military and the division it perpetuates wastes time, money, energy and resources.  Since military employees are not building houses, supplying food, stocking shelves, etc., they are creating an environment in which others must work more, others must do those things and must compensate for the nonproductive military employees.

Military does not and cannot ensure our freedom.  We are subject to compulsory taxation, proliferating laws and legality, conscription, and an overbearing, demanding and laborous work environment.  World government was able to lock down the entire planet, restricting everyone's freedom, destroying business, and no one was able to do anything about it.  That is not liberty.

**Global leadership has now demonstrated its ability to compel global cooperation and global action.  World leaders could likewise act to dissolve military, they could then transition that personnel to real jobs such as construction, food, agriculture, healthcare, etc., and lighten the workload and shorten the work week for every person worldwide.  But they do not.  Hold world leaders accountable.  They are taking our money after all.  At best they are incompetent, at worst deceptive thieves.**",False,npbe4t,DumbSlaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/npbe4t/the_pandemic_panicglobal_reset_a_reminder_of_your/,10,1

Whenever some military idiot loses a life or limb they lose it for their own nonsense, not me.

* Military/Soldiers do not protect freedom of movement or freedom of transportation; see Covid 19 lockdown and travel restrictions, etc.


* Military/Soldiers do not protect freedom of speech; see content removal and account suspension/termination terms of forums such as Reddit, Discord, Facebook, etc., see restriction of speech in court rooms, etc., see restriction of speech and action in retail business, etc.


* Military/Soldiers do not protect against corporate or government affluence.  In fact, military assists the activities of domineering corporations and governments.


Military did not thwart 9/11.  Military is not securing your liberty.

In theory military ensures liberty, in theory military defends a populace from invasion or intrusion (see 9/11).  In practice military is a global cabal extorting the world populace through threat of violence.

The guy over there, supposedly threatening us, is the same guy over here, supposedly threatening them.  It's all brainless nonsense to extort money and resources through fear.

Military employees can't get real jobs so they twirl weapons around and extract money from the populace through ambiguous threat of violence.  It's the same everywhere.  It's a racket.

World leaders won't change the scheme, world leaders benefit as they use military to help extract money from the populace.  World leaders use military to bully the rest of the populace to their advantage.  On a global scale.

Those with the guns, uniforms and badges are using threat of violence to control and extort you.

Grow up.

To afford doing so in a high cost of living city I had to work soul sucking corporate jobs where I was emotionally abused. I also found out I'm autistic exactly during this time.

Now I finally saved up a bit and quit my horrible jobs, my spouse is feeling better and looking for a job too. but I feel like a completely different person than I was before.

I feel completely barren and like a different person than the creative me from before corporate America.

The worst thing is because of autism I have no coping mechanisms and I have 0 friends as an adult immigrant. I eat my feelings and buy stupid things which make it all worse. My parents also got divorced right after I immigrated and my mom seems to be schizophrenic and involved in a cult. All of my family is still abroad.

I've tried going to therapy but they told me there's nothing they can do to help and that I need medication. Which I can't get right now because all psychiatrists are insanely unaffordable.

112,"Help, how do you do it, how do you persevere in life?","**I'll first give you some background (school, highschool) to my life up until now. (Can skip if not interested, not detrimental)**

This is my real, very first post on reddit so please be patient with me, and mods please if I do something wrong please go ahead and tell me so I can correct it next time.

Today, I'm a 23 unemployed Swiss dude with no papers or graduations whatsoever, or accomplishments in his life. 

(I'm sorry in advance if this is a mess, I'm writing this on the spur of the moment and have never been good narratively).

When I was a kid, I had a lot of problems (as probably like many others). I was heavily bullied in the small village I lived in, my dad had died when I was 3 years old of lung cancer which apparently had left some sort of trauma in me that I could never notice directly. My mom owned a restaurant/bistro which had living quarters upstairs and that's were we lived since when I was born. I lived with her, my half bro and half sis who were both 10 and 7 years older than me. As I mentioned, I was getting bullied almost daily by the kids in my village. I never had friends and was often thrown into the village fountain we had next to the bus stop to go to school, which made me backtrack and head back home often to change and had my mom stop work to drop me off there. The biggest problem I had and I'm, even today, extremely ashamed to admit it, but one of my problems (apparently tied to my dead father trauma) was that I could never go to the bathroom to relieve myself (feces) and used to wear diapers until very late. I stopped wearing them after being a few years old but the problem followed me further into my life.  When I got to the age of 8, we moved out of there and started living in a big city, where nothing was better. I joined a new school, where the problems I had were still very apparent. I didn't want to be with anybody and would still have the same toilet issues. It would smell bad and people obviously disliked it. I was then a year later thrown into a special class with only 6 other kids who also had problems and where the teachers would work with us more slowly. Its a good time to mention that I've never been smart at all or studious. I wasn't a troublesome kid but I had nothing good going for me. I don't really remember how many years I spent in that school, but at some point the problems I had were becoming increasingly problematic for a kid so my mom was forced to put me into a boarding school for 2 years after having spent 3 weeks in the hospital to try and help me out. This was a hard time for me, having to be separated from home and my family for the week. As far as I can remember, I had a lot of great experiences there because the teachers were great and the other kids wouldn't really bother me. I for the first time had a few people I could call friends, with which we used to play Pokemon on our Nintendo DSs and such. During those years, my toilet problems finally seemed to be gone and I could go to the bathroom and relieve myself like a normal person. After those 2 years, I was reintroduced into a more normal class in an other school, where again we would only be a few kids but we worked more on studies and grades. Next year was the year I finally was introduced into a normal class again. I was, at the time, 3 years away from finishing normal school. It was probably the worst class I had been in yet tho. I joined it mid-year for some reason and so was put into a class were people knew each other already and had groups left and right. I remember I was still very introverted and didn't want to attract too much attention, but the other kids let me know very clearly they didn't like me. I was very soon put into a situation so difficult that I couldn't process anything when I was at school, and my grades had dropped so low that they let me pass the year but put me into a lower-grade class for the remaining 2 years. Its during that hellish year that my older brother gave me his Xbox and I finally had something I could enjoy doing fully. I would play Mw2, halo reach, borderlands and such every time I had the occasion, I wouldn't do anything else during my free time anymore. I would even wake up 1-2 hours early each day to play the games some more with people I had met online. The remaining 2 years were fine, people were nice in my class but I didn't really have anybody I could call friends in it, but the ambiance was good enough so I could enjoy it. I then graduated from school.  but as I still had no idea what I wanted to do in life as nothing seemed to be enjoyable, so if I wanted to get into highschool I had to do an additional year with more difficult stuff to learn so I'd be caught up from the normal-grade class I was ''demoted'' from. During this year I found what I could call real friends which I still have contacts with today which is good to mention I believe. After that year which I passed with ok grades, I went into highschool since I still couldn't find an apprenticeship, I had yet to know what I wanted to do in life. I was at the time 1 or 2 years older than the average kid.

**Here is the part that starts to be a little bit more important in my opinion to today's events, but still part of my background.**

So I joined highschool, and the first and second years were pretty uneventful, I had failing grades in a few subjects but I still barely passed. I had some great times and most people were nice. Getting to my 3rd and ''final'' year, something had changed. I don't know why and how, but I slowly started getting depressed. I cursed to hell every day I had to spend there, and right around February, I lost the strength to go there. It started slowly throughout the first part of the year where I would skip 1 or 2 days of school, then at some point I just stopped going at all. Maybe because it was of the stress of finals coming and I knew I wasn't prepared, I could never remember anything I learned there for more than a month, So I got to my 3rd year without remembering anything I had learnt until now. I knew I was going to fail. School was very easy I always felt. You learned basic stuff, and there wasn't much of it. But highschool to me was different. I always got away with studying the night before because I just didn't have fun learning all those subjects and facts everyday there. German, history, maths, psychology, I just had no interest or fun in learning any of those things. I wouldn't go and would stay hidden in the dark in my room until my mom had left. Yeah, I'm a pos. I knew her and I knew she wouldn't understand, she would cursed me to death and would throw me back there by force if she knew, but I felt extremely anxious and out of place now in this class that I used to enjoy being part of. My mom was very strict in a lot of ways but only to some extent, she knew first hand I had a difficult childhood so she gave me space and time for the things I enjoyed doing on the side, but its different when it came to school and grades. I should have always done more and better to her, I could've been happy having good grades but she'd often them me it could've been better, so of course if she knew i was skipping she'd kill me. I didn't want to see or talk to anybody from that class either anymore, and I think it was the same for them. All those people I felt ''close to'' didn't give a shit that at some point I'd just stop coming all together. The stress and guilt were too heavy to try and go back, but the days she'd wouldn't have to work, I'd feign going in the morning and hang out in a café just waiting for the time to pass. I was so scared of going back, even when I left the house to go somewhere I didn't have the strength to bring myself there. After a month of fully not going, one day that my mom didn't work, we received a letter in the mail saying they hadn't seen my for a while and of course, my mom exploded. She called me while I was supposedly on my way to school telling me we received that letter, so I went back home, tried to explain myself and got the beating of a lifetime. She yelled, cursed, pulled my hair and said all sort of stuff you'd expect, rightfully so. My mom legit hated me for a few months because I had lied to her about going to school. At this time they sent me to see a psychologist, my mom never understood nor wanted to understand my problems, but my sis alongside our family doc convinced her to try and send me to one. After 6 seances, nothing really came out of it, I don't ever remember what we talked about with her but we just stopped because there was no point, I didn't want to go and talk to her, until now I never really felt comfortable talking to people about what I had inside my head without bursting into tears and feeling like shit. Remember that I've always been introverted to an extent, so outside of school and online friends  I wouldn't talk to anyone and didn't want to spend time outside of my room.  My mom since the moment she knew I didn't go she just wouldn't talk to me for a long time unless forced to. That had me fucked up for a while. I was still in a very bad mental state at the time, and since I had no other choice but to repeat the year and go back in August, which was like 4 months later, I just went. But I couldn't. I went there for a few weeks, but I felt miserable. All the time. I was around 3 years older than most, everyone knew each other and frankly speaking, I wasn't interested in getting to know them. I wasn't interested, but I still felt out of place and looked upon as a nuisance or a bug that shouldn't be with them in that classroom. So I did it again. But this time, I caught the letter they sent home and destroyed it. I didn't have the willpower or strength to go to school for every reason in the world, but I could never face my mom again with the same shit happening the next year, after I told her I'd go. I was in a pit hole getting crushed by anxiety and guilt. Every day and every night. I'd cry on my own and acted as if nothing was wrong because *I never felt understood anywhere*, what would the point be of trying once again to explain my situation, I knew how it would end up. So I just acted for months until the end of the year and just announced that I had failed. Even then my mom was pretty fucking angry and would yell at me and would constantly ask herself what she did wrong as a mother as if it was her fault, which I knew it wasn't, but seeing her like that hurt like hell on top of knowing what I had done this repeated 3 year that I didn't attend and kept hatting myself for a while. 

**Still background, but I'm gonna mention my professional life from here on out which is much more important than my school years probably.**

So, after those events, I had to go to the army(June to October 2019). It's mandatory in Switzerland so I had no choice since I was ''done'' with my studies, but I felt like it would be a great 4 months. I have no idea why, but I had positive apprehensions about it. Boy was I fu\*\*\*\*\* wrong. Probably the thing I hated the most in my life yet. More than anything. It was hell everyday, I felt like I was useless, I didn't know how to properly do anything, I always had to rely on my other comrades and I was exhausted to 200% everyday. I was getting yelled at everyday and the stress was on an other level. Some of the recruits were nice, but the other half were bullies. Once again. They would sometimes be ok-ish nice, and others utterly annoying and mean. Fortunately, when they saw I was having a hard time with anything ,even if they were a bit angry, they'd help me out. The other recruits who I got along well with were the nicest people out there. I was decently obese and asthmatic since I was around 10. So sports weren't really my thing, but they really pushed me up and helped me out when I needed it, even our sergeants. They knew I was trying so most of the times when it was something physical they'd be understanding that I couldn't do it as well. It seems nice at first, but it was still hell. This kind of environment wasn't for me, getting yelled at constantly, having to do things over and over and over, learning stuff I didn't like doing (out of all things I had to work as a firefighter in the swiss bunkers). I was given the little motivation I had in my by my friends helping me out constantly and trying their best to support me, but I felt like a weight all the goddamn time and I hated it just as much as everything else. I somehow ended my service like everyone else and finally got home.

Since I didn't have anything, my sister found me a job in the shop she worked a few weeks after I was done with the military and I started working there with an ''Extra'' contract, meaning I was an ''Extra'' and would just do the same work as anyone else but they'd just give me hours of work when they needed another person in the shop. I was still very much introverted and didn't want to interact with other at too much, but it was fine since it meant I was getting paid well for the low amount of work I had to do. I was still mostly happy tho, I had just come out of what I felt like was hell, and I could finally earn a little bit of money to help out. My brother and I were still living with our mom, my sister had moved out a few years ago already. That's why I could do it, only working a few days per week, sometimes 2-3, other weeks maybe 4, and of course for christmas I worked full time but I was still fine with it. as it was 1 month and after that I knew I could get new parts for my PC(only hobby). Then Covid came, and so I didn't have to work for 2 months, but during summer we opened again and I'd go work a few hours each week since there weren't many customers coming at the time. We got to November of last year and I unfortunately lost my job. My sis had quit since she wanted to start new studies and some other of my colleagues did as well, so the shop got a brand new staff and since they didn't need the ''Extra'' anymore as they had enough full-time employees, I was laid off.

# Today (main subject)

So after losing my job in November, my mom told me I needed to find an apprenticeship. I didn't finish highschool and had pretty much nothing in my hands. But the more I thought about it, the more I knew there was literally nothing I wanted to do. I had experienced a few things in my life already, and no matter where I looked, there was nothing I was interested in. I had been able to work only a few days per week because at home both my mom and Bro were working to sustain us. I felt like the least annoying thing would probably be working as a computer-scientist, so I started sending letters left and right, but I never received a single positive answer. At 23, I hadn't graduated anywhere and only had a little bit of work experience, so no one was interested in me. I was actually supposed to find an apprenticeship in 2020 but with Covid and me still being pretty confused about what I wanted to do in my life, I ended up still working at my previous job without looking for an option. 

A thing I forgot to mention concerning my health alongside that I'm pretty fat (100+Kg) and my asthma, is that since around being 20 years old, I started having a lot of bowel pains and painful, long lasting diarrheas. After some tests, we knew I was lactose intolerant (and not gluten), so I started avoiding everything containing it, but to no avail. It wasn't ever *too* annoying but it was still there, during the army there were plenty of time where I felt like I was going to explode, and so did the other recruits (most likely because lots of water+heavy exercises=bowel movement). Same during my previous job, but they were very understanding. It was a small gift shop without too many customers(Bliss since I don't like having to interact too much with people as mentioned, and that I don't enjoy working in retail), so I could just go have bathroom breaks whenever I needed them. But those past few months it's becoming increasingly more severe. I had done some sample tests mid-2020 that I send to my doc, but they all came back negative. no parasites, no IBD, nothing. He thought it was either stress or food allergies. I'd like to point out that those would happen very often, it could be fine for a week once in a while but then every day for a full months I'll be having abdominal pains and would be stuck in the bathroom for hours each day.

So after never getting positive answers to the letters I sent to get an apprenticeship, my mom was getting pretty mad and annoyed that I couldn't find anything, so she started pushing me to find something else, like in retail. I know for a fact I'd hate it with all I have, the one job I had was a dream job, but wouldn't be able to sustain someone on their own with the amount of hours I had.  The only reason I thought about being a computer scientist was because I knew a few people who enjoyed doing it, and since I was always in front of a computer it seemed fine, but the more I thought about it, the more thinking about being in that environment scared the sh\*\* out of me. Having to deal with people, learning stuff, getting yelled at for anything,  As the years passes, I feel like I wanna distance myself more and more from everyone. I don't talk to my 2 best friends I had back in highschool, working with customers is hell, I quite frankly don't like the people around me, the amount of time my family had been unfair to me in so many different scenarios has made me not want to spend time with them more than I need to. The only times I enjoy being *here* is when I'm online. That's the only thing I can say makes me happy. Not going outside, not seeing friends, not spending time with family, no sports, absolutely not working,

Up until now, as I said, both my mom and bro were working full time to sustain us. My mom especially as she's been working her whole life doing many jobs for long hours as she had to take care of 3 children on her own with a little bit of help from her boyfriend. Now she's getting to a point in her life where she's sick, tired, and would like to finally be free in a few years so she can leave and retire peacefully.

I understand that I need to do something so I at least tried, so when my mom managed to get me an  internship in a multimedia shop through some contacts, I accepted. It's only 2 weeks long and with the experience I got I thought it should be fine. But no, it actually wasn't. I hate it. That's my very first full time ''job'' in a long time, and I genuinely do not understand how people can do that for the rest of their lives. Wake up at 6:45am, and come home at 7:30pm being so fucking exhausted you can do nothing but fall onto your bed? How? How do people even do this. I don't want life to be this. You just wake up early, got to a god awful day of work, come back late and can't do anything so you just sleep? It would be even worse if I lived on my own and there was all the other stuff you have to take care of in the house. I hate how life is about this unless you've got all the money you want in life. It's not worth it.

I've been depressed for a few months now, I hate my life, I don't know what I want to do, I have my own health issues who prevent me from having a normal job-life if I were to ever get one, and I don't find enjoyment in anything aside being with my online friends. Life still goes on and I need to do something, but I don't know what and how to. My mom is killing herself working until my bro, my sis and I find something stable (my sister is in trouble as well now, but with money and still hasn't finished anything to have a stable job, my bro works at 80% but that's the only thing he does, he can't do anything when it comes to housework). I know it's mainly my fault and I hate it, but I'm not able to do anything. I couldn't finish my studies, I don't do anything interesting, I couldn't get a better contract at my previous job, I can't keep friends. I've pretty much been a failure my entire life, everything I've done was trash and I've only been a pest to everyone around me. I can't keep a job, I can't get an apprenticeship, because I know I will not be able to finish it like Highschool. I've never had the willpower or strength to finish or do anything properly for the few years I've been here. I hate who I am and what I've done, and I don't want to keep being such a burden to my family.  don't like saying it, but I've previously thought about suicide, to me it seemed like the best option. I'm against a wall right now, and it feels like the only way out is banging my head hard enough on it until I drop. On one side, if I can't find an apprenticeship, which my mom made clear was the only path that would lead me to a normal life, but I know I wouldn't be able to do it. But if I don't, my mom is gonna keep suffering from it and she shouldn't. I wished many time to not be there, not be a burden to everyone around me, not be such a failure who can't coop with work and people. I've only ever enjoyed and been able to do one single thing in life and it's gaming, that's why I thought ''if only I could get motivated enough to be a streamer, even a small one with the bare minimum to live with''. I'd like to do it because the way I see it, it'd solve all my problems. I'd also maybe finally have people who'd like me for who I am and would enjoy me and my content, while being able to care care of my bowel problems more easily. But who knows if it's going to work, who knows if it's now just another waste of time while my mom is working everyday until she can retire in a few years. 

I just hate what my life has become. I'm a loser, a pos, I can't accomplish anything and never will be able to. I wish everything had turned out different, and wouldn't have had to pester everyone by just existing.

No respect or support for any military of any nation.  No respect or support for brainless thieves &amp; thugs.

Whenever some military idiot loses a life or limb they lose it for their own nonsense, not me.

* Military/Soldiers do not protect freedom of movement or freedom of transportation; see Covid 19 lockdown and travel restrictions, etc.


* Military/Soldiers do not protect freedom of speech; see content removal and account suspension/termination terms of forums such as Reddit, Discord, Facebook, etc., see restriction of speech in court rooms, etc., see restriction of speech and action in retail business, etc.


* Military/Soldiers do not protect against corporate or government affluence.  In fact, military assists the activities of domineering corporations and governments.


Military did not thwart 9/11.  Military is not securing your liberty.

In theory military ensures liberty, in theory military defends a populace from invasion or intrusion (see 9/11).  In practice military is a global cabal extorting the world populace through threat of violence.

The guy over there, supposedly threatening us, is the same guy over here, supposedly threatening them.  It's all brainless nonsense to extort money and resources through fear.

Military empoloyees can't get real jobs so they twirl weapons around and extract money from the populace through ambiguous threat of violence.  It's the same everywhere.  It's a racket.

World leaders won't change the scheme, world leaders benefit as they use military to help extract money from the populace.  World leaders use military to bully the rest of the populace to their advantage.  On a global scale.

Those with the guns, uniforms and badges are using threat of violence to control and extort you.

**In essence this society is driven by violence, by those who utilize fear to compel action and behavior.  This is not a society I am ashamed to denigrate, nor is this a society I wish to support.**

Grow up.

Get rid of the idiots.

133,The difference from working in retail to working as a software developer.,"Hi everyone

To give a bit of a background, I’m 32, never went to college, and worked retail jobs since I graduated high school. I come from a very poor family. When I was 26, I moved back in with my parents to lower my costs, still paid rent but it was much cheaper then living in a studio apartment. When I was 30, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp. And when I was 31, at the start of covid, I got my first and current software development role at a small growing startup. I still currently live with my parents as housing prices are still climbing despite covid in my area.

I started to become pretty miserable at retail. I would be treated like subhuman, if my manager had to do something, he would just say he isn’t coming in, when I was sick, he would text me in the middle of the day to see if I can come in on the second half of the day... vacation days were super hard to use, he would text me on days off to cover shifts, had no consideration that maybe I had plans? He would watch to make sure nobody finished lunch 5 minutes late and would check the bathroom if we took to long. It felt like prison. They would treat us like machines.

I almost felt lost when I started my development job, I didn’t have to clock in, people would respect my time, I never get a call during my time off, when I called in sick, the only thing my manager said was “thanks for letting me know, hope you feel better”. No extra texts, just acknowledging, and moving on. Didn’t try to guilt trip me like in retail. Whenever someone messages me during off hours, they let me know that there is no rush and that I could respond when I’m free the next day. Nobody cares when I start my day, I would often start around noon since I hate waking up with an alarm. I got a performance bonus for the year as well. In retail, nobody would give a shit if I did well at my job, bonuses were none.

142,"Do I have an honest conversation with my boss or put in my leave,","Hi anti-workers,

I need to get something off my chest that’s been weighing heavily on me.

I work two per diem jobs (common in my field). One, let’s say job A, has become increasingly insufferable. I should’ve seen the red flags from day 1; for example I was given the “we’re like family here”.  My colleagues at job A have conflicts at with boss at job A and have had several one-on-one meetings with this boss to attempt some conflict resolution... almost every meeting has lasted no longer than 5 minutes, involved my boss yelling to the point where we can hear him through his office walls, and resulted with my colleagues leaving his office crying or calling out for the remainder of the day. Looking at our org chart, my role is situated just below my boss and above my colleagues. With that, my colleagues vent to me privately, again almost in tears, and it truly breaks me because I feel helpless. I’m too afraid to confront my boss to advocate for my colleagues (and honesty myself as well because I’ve felt belittled by my boss too). I need to keep this job because it looks good on my resume and I’d like a positive reference. I’m currently 8 months into this job and I was aiming to stay at least 1 year but that feels so far from now. Simultaneously, I cannot stand sitting back and pretending like everything is OK whenever my boss talks to me about my colleagues, assuming as though I’m taking his side. Furthermore, my other per diem job, let’s say job B, just offered me to go full time. Do I have this honest conversation with boss at job A and then quit to go to job B? I think I lose my chances of a positive reference should I need it. Do I stay another grueling 4-5 months at job A and feel anxious or as though I’m walking on eggshells?

I am currently in the first year of my Masters in a non-accredited medical physics program. From where I am, I can pivot into SO many well-respected fields, all requiring PhDs. I can become a medical physicist creating tumor radiation plans for cancer patients (need PhD and 2 year residency). I can become a medical science liaison (PhD and years of experience). I can become a professor (PhD and all the fun that comes with academic appointments). I can do a lot of things, and I know I am capable of achieving them. 

But guys. I'm tired. I am in trauma therapy for CPTSD (symptoms, not diagnosed and don't want to be), and realizing for the first time that I don't even want a career. I just want to be able to breathe and focus on fixing my mental health. All I need is a steady stream of income, and that is not hard to do with a masters in medical physics (I can get at least 60k easily, currently living just fine on 30k). 

This is a radical idea for me though. If I just work a few more years, I can achieve these grand high-paying careers. I can call myself Dr. 6cupsoftea. I can be in a textbook successful position. People keep telling me I'm wasting my potential by wanting to just...come away with my masters, and live simply.

162,We only get one life...,"...and so many of us spend it in such a way that makes us dread it daily--effectively making it so that we aren't living, or that we get to the point where many decide to not go on. What is the point of that? I'm here looking down the dark tunnel of my future, and like the promise that the flickering light at the end is an exit, isn't even a definite thing. Many people get sick, get into accidents, arent financially able to make it despite trying so hard. It puts me in a deep state of agony knowing that my days are blurring together, with the same day on repeat, yet I'm getting older. The ones I love are getting older and will die and I am not able to see them because I have to work in a job that does nothing but put numbers to my name, so that I can eat, sleep and MAYBE not have to do it way into the future. My body is dying every day and this low-hanging fruit of just being able to live on my own terms, is somehow out of reach?

I've always had problems with authority and questioning why things have to be the way that they are. Mostly because, no one could ever give me a good reason for it. Yet, this broke me down, so I played by the rules, got my STEM degree and I'm finding myself in that same place...incompatible with how this world works. My dreams I've had since being a kid, I've failed them because I've had one feet in and one out, and as a result, I'm in this purgatory we call the office. Looking back, all of my dreams have involved being in a position where I live for myself, doing the things that I am great at...because I knew that traditional life wasn't for me. People that succeed, get to abandon all the rules that most of us have to endure. 

I get one life, and if I dont enjoy it daily, won't that just put me into an early grave...one way or another? In that case, maybe I should just recklessly abandon traditional work, go for the sky, and if I fail and end up homeless? Well, I'm in the same spot as before arent I? Because we have this one life, and I want to live it and not die before I am gone.",False,np7xhn,LagdouRuins,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/np7xhn/we_only_get_one_life/,5,3

175,I used to be the guy that looked down on people like you...this week I'm quitting my six figure job. I don't know what will happen and I no longer care.,"Ever since I entered the workforce, my dream was to earn six figures. In retrospect, it was kind of a stupid dream. Why six figures? What would it change? I guess in my mind that was always the benchmark for being successful. 

Fast forward to now. I'm 31 years old and making my ""dream salary"" and I'm absolutely miserable. I don't even have an hour of time to myself most days and I've come to the realization that I'm spending 99% of my life doing things that I absolutely despise doing. I hate getting talked to like I'm a kid in meetings about teamwork, producing, and how much I should care about the company. I just want to stand up and say: ""I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANY OF THIS SHIT! I'M JUST HERE FOR THE PAYCHECK!"" But I just sit back and quietly wallow in my misery. It's at the point where the smell of the place makes me nauseous. 

I have a passion, my YouTube channel, and the fact that I can't work on that instead of doing this soulless bullshit job is eating at me every single minute of every day. I thought that I would quit once I start making money from youtube but now I'm realizing that this could potentially take years...and I'm at the point where I don't care.

I have enough in my account to cover me for about a year - year and a half if I live frugally and I've finally decided that I'm done. I don't give a fuck what happens, I'm done! I'm taking a year off and I'm just going to pursue youtube full time. If it doesn't work - I don't care. At least I'll have a year of happiness.

Could work as we know it just be a different form of prison? Yes we get to go home at the end of the day. We are beat to shit in some form or fashion. Someone is always scheming on you and/or trying to **** you in the @$$ over credit for a team project, or a promotion. Sometimes people are literally getting ****ed in the @$$ depending on where they work..which must stop. The pay is better than real prison pay, but that is the illusion that keeps us asleep at the wheel. Money. All this BS for money? We allow our selves get ground down until we break or burnout, and then become expendable and eventually get replaced. All these companies have their lovey-dovey ""mission statements"" preaching ""work-life balance.. family values, yada-yada-yada...""  The second you try to personally exercise that mission statement and move toward the ""life"" end of the balance beam.. Surprise....! The next thing you know you get to work only to be called to the conference room where your boss, his boss, and HR are standing by to let you know you have been written up for not completely handing over you soul. 

There has to be a better way. Working is good for the mind and body, but the way we go about it is totally unhealthy. Personally, I like to be productive and to be able to have nice things, but at what point is it worth sacrificing one's mental and/or physical health?

No sick days ( many people go to work puking ).

225,How I worked at an up-and-coming cult and got out of it,"I usually lurk around here. This is my first time posting and I want to get this out because this previous job that I worked at made me realize that I don't need to sacrifice my life over it. 

I'm a teacher. It took me a while to realize that this school that I worked at was a cult. I won't go much into the details but it was a school that fell under a certain sect of mysticism. The leader of this sect was revered, regarded highly among the followers and remained in shrouds of mystery. 

The first thing I learned while working in a cult organization is that they don't show obvious signs of cultism. Rather, they will welcome you and chant mantras such as ""We're a family"". Not even ""We're like a family"" but straight-up ""We're a family"". They will shower you with gifts and show the ideal version of themselves. They will promise you the stars and the moon. 

Then, once the honeymoon period is over, they will show you their true selves. 

For us, the honeymoon period was over once the school started. The gifts dried up and the promises that they made simply never existed. No brand new resources. No state-of-the-art gym or programs that would be implemented for students. We were forced to teach in certain ways but those ""certain ways"" were never elaborated clearly. Thousands of meetings happened but none of them served any purpose other than the admin giving ""pep talks"" that ultimately was about glorifying their leader and their sect. 

The admin tried to break us through the meetings or morning announcements. Every day, all teachers and students were all forced to mindlessly chant about how great their leader was without knowing the true meaning behind it all. This time period was only supposed to last about 20 minutes but it actually went over an hour and on some occasion, even three hours so that they could praise their leader. They would show us redundant videos about the ""power of your mind"", how ""you are a robot"", and the classic ""we are all one big family"". 

All of these videos and mantras chanted during meetings and within the auditorium made no sense. It was all a total waste of learning time and socialization time for students and teachers. 

Did the teachers voice their complaints? Yes. Some of us did, including me. Another thing you need to know about cults is that they don't like it when they have opposition within their community. Some of the more vocal complaints from teachers were stomped out through forced resignation. The school kept us all under control through fear and manipulation. It was funny because there were only a couple of students who needed to be expelled for serious offence such as violence but they never were expelled. The teachers who tried to work with those students got fired instead because ""someone needed to take the punishment"". It would've looked bad on the school if they had a track record of students who got expelled but high turnover rates obviously meant crap. 

They tried to break me a lot. They tried to indoctrinate me with their leader's videos and if I didn't comply, I would be threatened for not ""living up to my teaching standards"". There was high amount of favoritism and passive-aggressive micromanagement from the admin. Those who were not favored were punished by having the worst classrooms with pests and no resources. 

We had a couple of teachers who were on near verge of death and hospitalized. Guess what the admin forced them to do? That's right, work on their hospital beds and smile at that proudly. Yes, in fact, this was what all of us went through at this organization. We worked non-stop, sometimes for 24-hours straight. There were a couple of staff members who were so proud of ""hustling"" but it was all toxic positivity talk and brainwashing from the cult that made them think this way. 

At some point, after taking brutal amount of psychological punishment, I realized that there was nothing that they could do to me after seeing the hypocrisy and lies that the school lived up to instead of teaching proper character development. What broke me was actually seeing the school not care about the students. I felt like such a fool for believing that at least the admin cared about the students because that's what they always said. The admin always told the students how they were regarded as the admin's ""kids"" and how much the admin ""loved them"". Yet, this admin who said that they loved kids did not provide proper funding for students with special needs, and left students alone in classrooms on several occasions. This was all later revealed to me after I learned that they falsified their budget reports and heard the news on how they handled substitutes. 

After enduring mental torture that finally wore me down physically, I ended up leaving the school but not before I reported the school to the government. I learned that no job is worth your health, be it mental, emotional, or physical. Watch out for any organization or companies that exhibit cult-like behaviors, even if it's small. You might wonder why I took this job or why I didn't leave sooner. Well, that's what I used to shamefully think when it came to domestic abuse. Of course, I used to think about domestic abuse like that when I was a kid. Wouldn't it be just easier to leave? Don't you see the red flags? 

The point is, sometimes, you just get so blinded and swept up by what seems ""ideal"" that you end up losing what's actually important. I thought that in order to chase down my dreams, I had to sell my soul to the devil. And let me tell you, it wasn't worth it.

You are important. You matter. You're not just some organization's little slave. You are your own free agent. Don't be a mere cog in the machine. Don't sacrifice your soul to places that don't care crap about you. I wanted to be a teacher to do meaningful work for society. But once I worked at that school, my work became meaningless. I am trying to reclaim who I am and who I want to be. 

Don't let anyone try to force you. Period.  


TL;DR I worked at a school that turned out to be a cult and slowly revealed its true colors over the years. Never again. You are not your job. You are worth so much more than stupid ideals like ""dream jobs"" or ""being on proper life trajectory, aka getting your shit together"". No, and who cares?

227,This capitalistic society depresses me so much,"I know that this problem has probably been mentionned multiple times on this sub, but for god sake this fucking capitalistic society depresses me so much that i have to vent about it somewhere where i won't be judged by all those wage-slaves IRL who are so proud of themselves because they are literally selling their time + body to an employer that doesn't give a shit about them. The only reason i'm even working is because it's still mandatory.

But then i was also thinking about seeing a therapist for this, but then i'm also like : but that's so stupid lol ? Like what the hell is he/she going to do about it ? Like i wonder how the hell therapist are suppose to help mentaly ill people that are sick because of the way society is structured ?

For me therapy seems like putting a bandage on an open wound in that case, because therapists are only going to threat the consequences that this sick capitalistic society have on people (anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts) but then the cause will still remain the same. That seems like such a waste of time and money for me, but i don't know what do you guys think ?

Like i don't know how most people can be so naively enthusiastic and thrilled about the fact that we have to work at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 45 + years and then retire and slowly die at home once we're too old to work ? How is this a normal way to be living life ? Like you gotta be some kind of masochistic person to enjoy suffering that way and for such a long time.

And also how fucking sad is it that humans are literaly the only living species that need to ""earn"" the right to live by working their asses off ? Why the fuck can't we just chill and do our own thing at home with our friends and family ? Why do we have to work for some international company owned by a psychopath/sociopath of a CEO that doesn't give a fuck about us ?

We have to pay for everything in this cursed capitalistic society : food, water, shelter, education, medication and a lot of other things for fuck sake soon enough we're gonna have to pay for the oxygen that we're breathing.

And i don't mean that society is the only cause of my depression, they are probably other things as well that are causing it, but i still think that it plays a huge part in worsening it.",False,nnin50,Agitated-Situation23,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nnin50/this_capitalistic_society_depresses_me_so_much/,7,1

I went on [hotels.com](https://hotels.com) to confirm this... you can get a room at a beachfront resort in Phuket, Thailand for $28 per night! Depending on the hotel you choose, that's ballpark $630-930 a month for all basic expenses paid. That is definitely a comfortable existence for a low cost, especially compared to the US, where beachfront resorts go for $200+ per night and where a restaurant meal is 15 bucks a pop.

I heard Singapore is cheap like that too.

I used the word ""comfortable"" existence because I'm referring to places that have access to water and power. I'm sure there are some countries where you could live for cheap but wouldn't have clean water access.

252,I just remembered the most humiliating s*it i've been subjected to,"When I was 18 unemployed and desperately looking for work in my city which notoriously has a low unemployment rate I had to rely on the social security in my country. However, as a rule, if you collect any welfare payment you had to be attached to a job provider. I was like alright, not ideal as i'd prefer to go about this myself looking for a job but i guess i'll go along with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Instant. Regret. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was forced to participate in random meetings that would go for hours where they'd tell everyone stuff that people already know (call employers, put your email in your resume etc) and they'd force you to act out a phone call asking employers for a position. It was kind of embarassing and i'd have much preferred using that time on my own to find a job. 

The workers there looked down on you for not having work, constantly questioning people's effort to get jobs (kind of the ""you're lazy there's work everywhere"" rhetoric that boomers use). 

But the part that really humiliated me, was they made us dress up in formal attire and go in to our local shopping centre asking for work in the stores. Nothing made me feel so awkward and anxious then seeing people I know and walking in to stores asking employees that obviously were tired of this job provider sending people in to ask for work. I wanted to die.

259,I could use some suggestions for a new job.,"I made a post like a week ago about my experience as a merchandiser for Pepsi. In short, I'm ready to quit. It's just too much stress for me to handle and I find the entire process to be grossly inefficient for what's expected. I could potentially transfer to FritoLay as it's part of the same company but I dont want to merchandise period. Not even the benefits are worth it to me, and I dont like the feeling of being held hostage at a job I despise just to have medical benefits. 

So basically, I'm searching for something full time with benefits and that's just really low key. I need a job with minimal stress that's not going to worsen my depression and anxiety issues.

Frankly, I'm not an ambitious or passionate person, I sort of just exist one day to the next, and I wouldn't mind just wage slaving at my old burger flipping job until I decide I've had enough of life but I can't get benefits from it.

264,Temp AgencyTried To Get Friend To Work Nearly 80 Hours In One Week...,"Yep, as the title says, it’s pretty true and it’s a job I used to work at myself!
*Since I got nothing to lose, it’s a temp agency the MNM Mars company uses to get workers*

   Anyways, after I left the temp agency and went back to self employed work, my sister’s boyfriend had told me he was going to work there. I warned him and explained why he should not; which he didn’t believe until *it happened.* 

   He worked there for a month and after the first week had told me of the crap that he had to deal with the temp agency; however, the real breaking point was what comes next: *They wanted him to do a 6 day, nearly 80 hour work week the following week*
We were both shocked which led to him leaving the company...

80 hours you say? How is that possible; it’s a factory job and not roofing (used to work in roofing, loved it but long hours). Well here’s the layout, they wanted him to do 12 hour shifts for 6 days, BUT THAT’S NOT ALL! They require the temp agency workers to clock in a hour before their shift which would stretch it to 13 hours! But here’s the real kicker...they require all temp agency staff to stay what could be 30 minutes to an hour after their shift until their replacement arrives...so we are looking at 13 and a half to 14 hours a day, for 6 days...HELL NO!

*What’s funnier is that he signed up for 8 hour shifts which pay $9-10 an hour; however, quickly after his hire, they moved him to 12 hour shifts...If you work 12 hour shifts, they’re supposed to pay $12 an hour; however, because he didn’t sign up for the 12 hour shifts in the beginning, they kept him at $9-10 an hour per signed agreement. So essentially, he was working with other people who were making $12 an hour because they signed up for that shift in the beginning, but moved him to the same shift as the $12 hour but refused to pay him $12 an hour because he didn’t sign up for that shift in the beginning*",False,nnd2sb,Ro_Capone,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nnd2sb/temp_agencytried_to_get_friend_to_work_nearly_80/,5,1

276,We will never have full employment or full automation because unemployment and handwork is good for capitalism,"Unemployment is not all bad for the bosses.  Imagine a society where there is full employment,  workers would not fear losing their jobs, they would  feel more comfortable fighting for their rights and associating with unions without being harassed and pressured. Unemployment is a necessity  for maintaining capitalism, bosses needs an army of reserve labor force to replenish aways when needed. 

In addition, capitalism in its foundation prevents the total automation of labor, as it is human wage labor that generates product value. Have you ever stopped to think about what society was like before money? People exchanged goods for goods, but as we evolved, we can no longer exchange because we would hardly find someone who would be exchanging what we need for what we have to offer. But to replace this exchange system we need some product value metrics, for that we have to find a common denominator in every human product, which is labor, how much does labor cost? In a very simplistic way, work costs what an average human needs to stay alive, keep working in the next day, and reproduce, so that their children work too.

I’ve quit a number of jobs since I started working, gotten fired from one, and got laid off from another due to COVID-19. I can feel my parents judging me for constantly job hopping but nothing seems to be the right fit for me. I quit my last job (housekeeper at a hotel) because I didn’t have a set schedule and my hours were too unpredictable. I applied to be a housekeeper at a retirement home, got hired, but I’m basically a janitor who cleans resident rooms here and there.

I already deal with social anxiety and depression so I’ve gone into housekeeping because I hate being under pressure to get everything right in retail/food service settings. I thought it was bad before when I dreaded going to work. This job...has given me depression almost as bad as I’ve experienced in middle school. Like to the point of feeling suicidal. I’ve never had a job be so bad I feel like I need weed and alcohol to cope. I’ve wanted to cry every morning I woke up this past few weeks. I’ve been smoking every morning when I used to only smoke occasionally with friends.

I’ve had low motivation at jobs before but never this low. Most of the residents like me and I’m a thorough cleaner but I already feel myself slipping. Some of them literally WATCH me clean and it’s so anxiety inducing. All the nurses are already talking shit about me. Taking the trash out stresses me out because some people fill their bags all the way to the brim and I’m not strong enough to throw them over my head into the dumpster. Had to take the trash out today in the pouring rain and got gross dumpster water all on my glasses lol.

I live with my parents and they’re already worried about me always quitting jobs and not having a career path and I feel like I have to stay at this one out of shame of not knowing what I want. I know it’s not good to sacrifice your mental health for a job but I don’t want my parents to get any more disappointed with me.

What baffles me is that employers expect the entire workforce to be of the same quality. That we should all be top quality for any price (High OR low).

People who can’t cut it in a middle to high paying job, or who alternatively don’t have the opportunity to even get their resume in front of a middle to high paying job hiring manager, work these low paid jobs. Also- the issue of short staffing and turnover. If you have a worker, any worker who is willing to show up to a low wage job. Why wouldn’t the employer treat them well in every way besides the wage and alsp recognize that they will need to invest training time to upskill or gradually fix problem behaviors with the worker?

301,"""On-Call Only"" jobs shouldn't exist","First time posting here, and honestly, I just need to vent.


My work operates almost solely on call.  I've complained about this method of work before, but have been continually told it is used to reduce costs when the store isn't that busy, which I suppose makes helps their bottom line...but hurts me.  I am given a ""schedule"" but whether or not I work the days I am ""scheduled"" is always a guessing game.  So, I am forced to sit on standby for 7-12 hours at a time...waiting to see if I'll even be needed.  And when I am called in, I'm typically only given a 30 minutes notice (or less). 


If a business depends on these practices to stay running, as opposed to having normal schedules, I don't think that is a business that should be open.  Why should I stress myself over getting ready, sometimes for a ""shift"" that only lasts an hour or two, just because my boss wants to save some money?  There are weeks I take home less than $100, but I can't get another job because what if I get called in?

310,My involment on this sub is based on me losing a great career because i took a vacation that was planned a month ahead of time,I just now fell back in love with my job I wont ever trust a company again though I was the star employee. The only one who worked their 50 worked months straight alone to meet deadlines. Showed up earliest left latest. Only Saturday and sunday worker. Had over 150 hrs of vacation and 30 hrs of pto and god knows how much sick time. I threw up in front of my boss and he laughed at me and asked about a deadline. I lost 40lbs and chain smoked due to stress. Close family friends asked if i was on meth I was so run down from working 46 days straight before I took the weekend off. I did 5 peoples jobs and when someone fucked up I was blamed. There was a fuck up by one of the three people I was supposed to train all alone and I knew I was going to be accountable so I put in for 50 hrs vacation. 1 week way early id decided I needed some me time I went to see my mother who I dont see in another state and rode motor cycles. Before going on vacation but after it was approved I was given 90 days to improve or be fired pretty standard I had a feeling I was going to be fired regardless as when youre the one trained person running 3 trainees and the lead nothing can get done without you. During my week off I kept up with work texts. Texted trainees told them to grab another trainer person to get what they could done and to call if they needed it. When i came back absolutely nothing had been done that week. I knew it so I clocked myself into work at 2am and worked until 237 pm and single handedly got everything done. At 239 when I finally sat down and things were running they told me I was fired because of something an apprentice had done 3 months ago lol fuck the 90 days right. I wasnt paid out shit I should have been compensated or paid my time in the end I worked a 12.5 hour day spent years working for this company running everything myself only to be shit on when I said fuck you I'm using my time something everyone else did daily.

And it just makes me feel like they question my integrity which pisses me off. Like what is wrong with these people?!

318,Working sucks. An industry to make the best of it in.,"I lurk on this sub often and I wanted to share my suggestion on how to get through the grind.  Learn to code/design.  Hear me out.

We all have to work, unless born with a silver spoon.  Building something with your own hands/creativity is the best escape IMO.

Reasons to learn to design/code...

1) You're foundational to running the business. After enough experience, it's one of the only career paths that can lead to financial independence and not working.  
2) It pays very well as a normally salary position. 50k-60k starting salary.
3) It's free to learn if your self motivated. [start here](https://www.codecademy.com/)
4) You own your work.  It's your ideas coming from your brain.  You think it, you build it.
5) There are a million open jobs.  Your boss sucks?  Quit, start a new one 2 weeks later.  Every time you leave, you're paid more at the new job.
6) Our Time off rivals our European counterparts.  Typically 3 weeks min, upwards to 5 weeks.(American pro)
7) Top notch benefits.  Some employers will pay 100% of your healthcare (American pro again)

I could probably come up with more, but my point is...  Working sucks, make the best out of it.  Learning a skill where you can make your own financial independence is rare but in this case VERY obtainable.

* Military/Soldiers do not protect against corporate or government affluence.  In fact, military assists the activities of domineering corporations and governments.


Military did not thwart 9/11.  Military is not securing your liberty.

In theory military ensures liberty, in theory military defends a populace from invasion or intrusion (see 9/11).  In practice military is a global cabal extorting the world populace through threat of violence.

The guy over there, supposedly threatening us, is the same guy over here, supposedly threatening them.  It's all brainless nonsense to extort money and resources through fear.

Military empoloyees can't get real jobs so they twirl weapons around and extract money from the populace through ambiguous threat of violence.  It's the same everywhere.  It's a racket.

World leaders won't change the scheme, world leaders benefit as they use military to help extract money from the populace.  World leaders use military to bully the rest of the populace to their advantage.  On a global scale.

331,A little rant,"Burner account.

So I just started a new job at a nationwide chain of grocery stores. Not gonna give a specific name, but the name may or may not have something to do with a merchant named Joseph. Now I knew this store could have a cult following, but *holy fuck* are the inner operations fucked.

First off, the emotional labor that is expected is total bullshit. Unlike certain other grocery chains that more or less just expect you to be cordial with customers, this place wants you to act like their goddamn friend. Smile all the time! Don't frown! Put up a happy face! Be cheerful all the time! Act interested in them! I don't know how everybody else working there hasn't gone bonkers for fucks sake. Working 8 hour shifts with only 1 half hour break, and having to put on a false façade of cheerfulness the entire time. Honestly it's exhausting beyond just the physical labor.

Secondly, the management pisses me off. The normal workers do pretty much *everything* in the store, from stocking shelves, registers, to ordering new supplies and breaking down new shipments. All the while, the managers perform almost 0 labor, are basically just there to coordinate people (as if we're incapable of doing that ourselves), and yet still probably get paid more than us. Glorified babysitters is what they are.

Thirdly, wages. Now I will say that for a retail grocery job, the wages are relatively good, exceeding the minimum wage in my state. However, the way in which they are determined for each worker is truly fucked. In my interview, the manager of the store very explicitly told me that people start off at different wages, some higher and some lower than others, based on their performance in the interview. Think about how fucked that is! The money that people get paid isn't based off their actual labor, but how much they can kiss ass in an interview!! Fucking sick.

337,"Get a Job You Bum! - An Analysis of Work by David Graeber, before he published Bullshit Jobs!","""All over the Western World, and surprisingly less so in the East, we have conditioned humans to the idea that all work has value and if you don't work, you have less value or no value. The actual truth is: most jobs today don't provide value. Most jobs today are not doctors, teachers, chefs, musicians, artists, novelists/storytellers, farmers etc. Those are important jobs... Most jobs are NOT necessary and yet we actually have shortages in important work. There are not enough teachers, mentors, skilled carpenters, builders, librarians etc.

How many times have the unemployed been told ""Get a job, you bum?"" It's telling that fellow members of the working class are rarely the ones who care enough to say that. You rarely here the construction worker, the retail employee, the waiter, or the bank clerk use such language. Those words come from people in suits: the stockbroker, the accountant or the magnate. We're going to have to wake up to the idea that work for work's sake robs people of dignity instead of providing it. The only kind of work that might provide dignity are jobs that help people or create things. It's also quite important to acknowledge that dignity being measured by how hard you work isn't very dignified at all. Dignity comes from our humanity.""

354,Am I lazy or smart?,"My situation is this—48, long time cruise ship manager, on leave due to coronavirus…

I generally work eight months a year, travel for three months, and spend about one month with parents.

I’ve saved up a lot of money due to low expenses (no house, car, food or housing costs on the ship, etc) and decided not to work for under $15 per hour in Florida.

For the abuse low wage workers get, to the risk of coronavirus (although that’s out because I’m vaccinated), to having to share cars with my parents to get to and from work, I decided not to work.  I don’t get unemployment (welcome to Republican hell Florida) but my expenses are very low since I’m with family until I go back to work.

The plan is to work another ten years, and retire outside the us so I don’t go bankrupt with health care.

I work to live not live to work.  It’s nice having a job where I don’t have to commute, cook, clean, or do laundry.

Have I got this all figured out or am I being a lazy bum?  Life’s too short for an abusive part time or temp job when a few thousand dollars either way makes no real difference in the long run.

I’m also in a ship position where I am treated fairly and respectfully, with reasonable hours and no micromanaging.

357,I feel like walking out of my job.,"So, today I’m back at work after a long quarantine period and a bout of Covid and honestly as much as I missed leaving my house  I think I forgot quite how awful my job at a large chain is.

Before my Manager #1 left they asked me to do task “A” and leave task “B”

Manager #2 comes in and doesn’t even come down from the office and I don’t see them until 10 minutes before my shift ends and has this conversation with me:

Manager #2: Why have you not done task Y? You’re over an hour late to do it!

Me: Manager #1 told me to do task A instead and leave task B for the night crew.

Manager #2: OK So, right now you are accusing Manager #1 of being a liar because that’s not what they told ME. Do you understand? 

Me: I’m not accusing anyone of being a liar, I just know I was told to do task A. It’s probably just a miscommunication? 

Manager #2: How can it be a miscommunication? He told me you were doing task B which you’ve failed to do and made an accusation towards him of lying, we’ll both see you in the Office an hour before your shift tomorrow. 


I’m sick of this shit man, I feel like I’m spoken to as less than human and this isn’t the first time I’ve taken slack for the Managers incompetence here. It doesn’t seem to matter how hard I work, how many hours I do to help out or what I do. They’ll find something to pick at me for and if they can’t then they’ll invent something.

361,I'm mentally ill and like working. I go into employment when I can and due to my problems I regularly get laid off. I have this to say.," Most employers like me but they lay me off after my depressive slump because I only come into work 3 days a week. It's typically ""sorry, you're a good worker and we understand you have problems, but we need someone more reliable"". I've gone through like 8 jobs over the last two years. I'm pretty qualified in many trades and I get glowing reports when I'm not in a slump, I get called in for casual jobs regularly for people too.  


However, sometimes I get employed into places that chronically abuse their staff. They try that shit to me and I just don't come in the next day or bail after my first pay. It's unreal to me that these people take it. They've all been gaslit hard into it, and it's the most depressive thing to see. Like wtf, just go on unemployment and get another job? They're not bad workers and they're not stupid, it's pure gaslighting that induces it, plain and simple. The company always, ALWAYS, without fail tries to hit you with ""We're the best company around and we expect the best!"". Yet all the stuff about high standards is always an excuse to treat their workers like garbage. 

That shit is sadder than NEETdom, a more depressive fate. And I just can't understand why these people put up with it. Imagine being a middle aged man being constantly demeaned by someone at work.   


I don't give a fuck about the rest of the NEET idolization here, work has always been good for me. But these people in these abusive jobs need recusing.",False,nmsot5,ambrosia_detente,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nmsot5/im_mentally_ill_and_like_working_i_go_into/,3,1
362,Polling my antiwork brethren on work anniversaries,"So, I've been put in charge of sending out ""congratulatory"" emails to everyone in my office for their work anniversaries. I personally think the rich-ass attorneys that I work for could buck up a little and offer something more than an email as thanks for spending more of our lives in the office than with our families, but I guess that's just me. 

So, in that spirit, I would like to make my messages a veiled fuck you to the company. A reminder that these people have accomplished more in their lives than suffering through bad office lighting and team building exercises for the last X years. This is where I'm coming up a little short. How do I make this about the amount of their lives they've spent here and not about how much the company ""values"" them. Bc they don't.

If I could I'd send out something along the line of:

""Congratz, you've help evict this many families from their homes in the last 15 years of service.""  

""Congratz, you've helped billionares buy up XXXX miles of public land in your time with us.""

suffer want; who, clothed with political freedom, are con-
damned to the wages of slavery; to whose toil labor-saving
inventions bring no relief, but rather seem to rob them of
a privilege, instinctively feel that ‘‘there is something
wrong.” And they are right.

The wide-spreading social evils which everywhere oppress
men amid an advancing civilization, spring from a great
primary wrong—the appropriation, as the exclusive property
of some men, of the land on which and from which all
must live. From this fundamental injustice flow all the in-
justices which distort and endanger modern development,
which condemn the producer of wealth to poverty and
paper the non-producer in luxury, which rear the ten-
men house with the palace, plant the brother behind the

church, and compel us to build prisons as we open new
schools.

Honestly I have many questions. How can their be equal housing when equal property valueis impossible? How much land is given to one person? What happens when the population overwhelms the amount of land because we gave it to everyone else? what happens when the farmers we rely on are given limited crap soil and we have no food supply?

I get kidney stones but my job didn't recognize it as LOA eligible so I understandably had to call out when I got stones giving me occurences after I ran out of sick time. ""My attendance has been an issue"" is what they told me as to why I didn't get a quarterly bonus even though I explained my issues $1200 across 3 bonuses that I got nothing on...ok I guess I get it. I was scheduled to come back to my home store next week so I called to talk to my boss and she tells me they hired another tech from walgreens, which I knew about because another tech quit to go back to school. What I didn't expect was when I called today my boss who has been like a 2nd mother to me sometimes just flat out said ""unfortunately due to a change in our needs we can't put you on the schedule"" not a you're fired or this is why we are letting you go just reading a pre written response. I'm not that upset (like I said been looking at jobs for a couple of weeks). I know this is because I called out due to stones and also I got sick twice since I was in DIRECT CONTACT with people not behind a counter like leaning in and giving them shots 50-100 ppl per day so I had to quarantine because of my failed health screening. I know they won't say it is because of that but I feel like that's exactly what it was. I'm looking to change fields anyway and just got my OLCC marijuana workers permit so I got that going much more relaxed than fucking retail.

I'm devastated I have to be ""happy"" to lose my freedom.","I have been in tears on and off for the last 3 days since finding out because I know this means my life is basically over. I'm 24. I'll now be a full time wage slave until at least 70. My life is going to be work, resting for work, recovering from work, and only very occasional fun. I also have to move to my country's biggest city which is extremely expensive and it's hitting me that I'm basically not going to have much money to enjoy my life for basically....the rest of my life. I'm going to lose things like student discounts and being able to see the doctor and buy medication cheaper because I'm not going to be a full time student anymore, and since I'm a wage slave, I will have to pay $150+ a month for the asthma inhalers that stops me dying and the anti depressants that kinda trick me into thinking I don't hate being alive and the ADHD medication that makes me as unnaturally productive as capitalism demands.

Everyone is acting like this is the **bEsT NeWs EvEr**, and is mad that I'm not thrilled, but I'm just crushed that this is considered something to be excited about - having to sell the best hours of the day in the best years of my life to pay for an existence I never asked for. And I'm not allowed to point out that I never asked for this existence without being called a brat or being told to grow up. But I didn't. I'd have chosen to never be born. I laugh when I see American anti abortion advocates be all ""what if your mother aborted you"" because I wish she fucking DID. I wish I didn't have to live this life because if you are not born into extreme wealth, it is not worth it. 

My body sleeps naturally from 2:30am-10:30am and now I have to live on a 7am wake up clock and I'm going to be constantly tired and exhausted and am already dreading it. I'll have to wear uncomfortable clothes to be considered professional and deal with office politics. I just want to get by. I don't want any of this.

Coronavirus ruined my degree. My study abroad semester was cancelled, I spent half the degree doing online classes from a bedroom shared with my sister instead of actually getting the experience of being at University. I've always wanted to go to Japan. My mother promised me a trip to Japan when I graduated which I don't get to take anymore because of New Zealand's strict border closures. I mean, she hasn't taken it away forever, but when I do get to take it, I now have to worry about getting time off work, will be paying rent while not living in my place etc and that sucks. The last of my freedom was stolen from me by this fucking pandemic and I'm not allowed to mourn it because sArAh tHere aRe pEoPLe iN oThEr CoUntRiEs tHaT aRe DyiNg. I'm sick of it.

I’m currently doing multiple jobs within 2 different businesses owned by the same parent company. I’m college educated so I get my fair share of both white collar and blue collar work.

I’ll admit, with the heat starting to kick in I’m starting to go home a lot more tired than before so I usually only have enough time to do some chores, eat, and shower before knocking out.

I wanted to see if anyone here is on the same boat. I think for sure life would be a lot more easier for me if I only had to do office work for 40 hours a week. Regardless I’m sure there is still a lot of struggle with that scenario but I don’t think I can relate to that as of now.

411,How I lost faith in the employment system in this country I love so much...,"Hi! 

I was a court clerk for 3.5 years. I made $13 an hour. I spent half my time in court and the other half of my time auditing attorney requests for money. In this auditing portion of my job, I saw massive fraud - attorneys faking billing, lying about how much time they spent in the court room, lying about how much time it took them to write motions...just lying all the time. I fought endlessly with my bosses about it, telling them that we had to act...I put my heart and soul into it. And for 3 years, one of my bosses and I fought and we tried to stop these people from stealing tax payer dollars. Unfortunately he retired and was replaced with a micromanager. And it turns out the micromanager liked to read employee emails and didn't like people shitting on her attorney friends. And after 3.5 years of giving 100%, I was fired because I was ""sexting"" my girlfriend on my work computer (I was dealing with insane depression issues and my parents were about to get divorced).

My fault I guess.

So I applied for jobs within the court system and got hired a few months later. I didn't really level with them about why I lost my previous job because it was too embarrassing - I just told them my position was eliminated from my last job.

2 months into my new job, I get a call from my boss. I'll make this story short - my previous boss who fired me went out of her way to contact my new boss, told him what happened, and so he called me in and fired me on the spot (before my probation ended so I had no employee protections).

This is when I slipped into a major depression.

After 6 months, and after applying to 135 jobs, and disclosing to many why I lost my jobs (didn't want to get fired a 3rd time) I got hired. The new employer asked me to never talk about why I lost my previous jobs ever again (as if I really wanted to). I started there and things went great for about 6 months.

6 months into the job, my supervisor quits and they decide they will not hire anyone OR promote anyone...so it's now just me doing 2 people's work. I immediately find another place to apply to and I was able to get hired. On my way out after resigning my ""boss"" pulls me into their office and BERATES me to the point where I left in tears (so that's 3 jobs in a row of me leaving in tears if you are counting).

I start my next job and things go okay for the next 2 years.

After 2 years of this job, there was an incident (not involving me). In a week's time we had 2 people quit and there was NO ONE to cover their duties. I had been training them so I was reassigned to their work (2 people's workload). I worked 70 hours weeks for many months, giving 100% to make it work. And I succeeded. After months of working long days, I had it under control.

Then my mother almost passed away. Thank god the hospital saved her life. During those weeks, I still kept working. I didn't want to disappoint my employer because we were so short-staffed. I was giving 100%.

A few months later my supervisor quits and I applied for her job. I was the only internal applicant, only internal interview. I had 3 years of experience at this place. I get a call one morning from my friend at work and he says, ""Oh you dirty dog you, I heard they sent out a job offer and you didn't even tell me you got it"". Turns out they told people they gave out an offer to someone else before they even told me that I was out of consideration. I found out from my friends. My boss called me ~10 hours later to tell me I didn't get the job...

And then a year goes by (what a fool I was to stay).

And 3 weeks ago my new supervisor quit.

And today I find out they are promoting a new person, recently hired in the last 2 years, to be the manager over me...the guy who has been doing 2 people's worth of work for going on 3 years...the guy who worked while his mom was in the hospital (how dumb I am)...the guy who cleaned up the mess of everyone who kept quitting.

It has been a tough day.

But I've been fortunate enough to end up on the lucky-side of capitalism in my life. When I was in my early 20s and just started working at court, back in 2012 and 2013, I invested every spare penny I had into Tesla stock. I had no friends, no social life, nothing...so I just spent my nights reading and learning and I was blown away by electric cars. The investment didn't amount to much for the first 6-7 years because I didn't have much money to even invest in the first place...but in the past year or so I've managed to make nearly $1 million dollars, most of which is now cash...life-changing in so many ways for someone who takes home $25k a year...but yet I never let it actually ""change"" my life. But...after what I've been through with employers, and after being passed over again today, I'm sure as shit thinking about letting this money change my life. I also would like to get revenge on 1 employer for a change and make THEM feel bad for once.

What do you think? Should I continue to be humble, keep my head down, and ignore the money I've saved? Or do you think its time to tell someone to F off?

I'm 30, single, blessed by the stock market gods, but miserable because my employer uses me AND never thinks of me for anything...they just think I'm a peon.

Fuck them for thinking I'm a fucking peon. I'm not some dumb shitbag. I'm worthy. I'm a good person and I give 100%. But the employers in this country are evil and are turning me into a monster. I'm mad all the time, sad, angry...its not what it should be at all...not when I've been blessed the way I have.

425,Dying pet? Nope. Return to work.,"Married, no kids, obsessed with my 2 shelter cats. I'm a writer, the only person in my department, and I easily switched to WFH in March 2020 when my small company reacted to COVID. I'm also moving in a little over a month and will be allowed to continue working remotely at that time.

However, my workplace is calling us all back into the office full time, starting next week, with no reasons cited other than ""restoring company culture."" No exceptions for anyone despite the fact that most of us greatly prefer WFH and have been doing it very successfully for the past 15 months. 

Yesterday, I was told my older cat probably has intestinal cancer. Even though he's being treated with a steroid pill now, he's a tiny thing and has been losing weight super fast at a rate that would almost completely debilitate him in a few weeks. He's also a grazer and, when he does eat, he prefers to do it in small amounts regularly throughout the day. So now I'll have to be away from home for 11-14 hours every weekday with no ability to care for him...during what may very well be his last month of life. 

I know I've been so lucky to WFH for the time I did, and I literally get to return to WFH in a month, but the timing of this is all so sucky and I just wanted to vent. I feel like execs make decisions like this just to flex their power, with no care for how it affects the human beings under them.",False,nn2k29,lv2glrfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nn2k29/dying_pet_nope_return_to_work/,13,1

429,Why they really want you to go back to the office.,"There are a couple reasons why all of the sudden Covid is all good now, does not seem to matter like it used to. Time to go back to the office even though your life became greater working from home. There is less pollution because of all the travel, more time for yourself. Seemingly at no expense for the company right? I mean, work output is the same to them so why is it company bosses vs workers on this one. Well….

Here are a couple of the real reasons:

1. Real estate value: the basic, most capitalist thing we all know about businesses: its all about the bottom line money, value, revenue - costs = profit. All of the sudden, that nice modern glass-everywhere building loses its value. Becomes abandoned. 

2. Middle managers and HR: what is their job anymore? the link between the all mighty executives and the peasant workers, looking over your shoulder to see what you’re doing, organising team building, walking around giving the workers praise for things they dont actually understand. Having pointless scheduled meetings. No need for that! Workers can just zoom call. Their workloads are slashed and almost made redundant.

3. Fear of change by the bosses with the old person mindset. Someone on top of their game should be able to adjust: get out of that office space lease fast! Accept this is how its done now. 

4. And finally ofcourse there are workers who enjoy the office politics. Their ability to kiss the boss’ ass and undercut their coworkers far outweighs actual skills. Or they might be a good person that let work take over their life and they dont know what to actually do with their spare time.",False,nn6mm3,DarkWolf164,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nn6mm3/why_they_really_want_you_to_go_back_to_the_office/,6,1

453,Mental impediments to antiwork ideas,"Hi,

it's been quite clear to me that an antiwork-centric society would be far less alienating for everyone and could possibly stand a chance against climate change. However, the way there isn't easy and people have integrated a lot of political ideology that moreless gaslights them into accepting the current system as it is and basically go to work as expected of them.

**What are those blockages?**

* Any sort of wealth redistribution reform will be perceived (even by a large majority of the modest people) as a crime against ""economic freedom"", taxes that would fund infrastructure and social programs are perceived as ""parasitic"" and people who are actually more in need are dehumanized.
* This is grounded in further unconscious mental structures. The idea of merit is central to this. For the reactionary ideology to work, people's real-life position at a given point have to be the expression of their moral value through ""motivation"", ""grit"", ""seriousness"" or ""hard-work"".
* The reactionary ideology has to posit that the rich man has worked hard and deserves his wealth (however often inherited) and that the poor man's condition results from bad choices, bad morals (laziness) or even intellectual inferiority.

Now, obviously jobs aren't allocated out of ""merit"" nor ""intelligence"" in the real-world. Determining factors have been scientifically proven to boil down much more to your parents' cultural capital than it does to whatever individual faculties you may have. 

That's why reactionaries love to glorify ""free-will"" as an essential part of human nature and tend to reject more deterministic accounts as ""apologetic for the lazy"" or other negatively-loaded terminology meant to label the other party as a bleeding-heart liberal.",False,nmk6j1,DisposableNominalist,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nmk6j1/mental_impediments_to_antiwork_ideas/,1,1

471,Drinking while at work to relieve work depression,"Hello everyone. I am currently working in a fast-food chain. I am 26 years old and due to bad decisions, I have to work in fast food until I complete my degree. I am hoping to get into a better job related to my degree however this has to do for now as it pays the bills. 

I absolutely hate this job. I hate the rude and entitled customers. I hate the long working hours from 10am in the morning till 10pm at night. I hate it when after I long day, i'm ready to close and go home, a bunch of customer walk in the minute i'm about to close and order a large meal, making me late by 30min (unpaid) and having to get home at 1am. I can't take it. It is causing me severe depression. 

I'm not addicted and I only drink once every month or so. When I do drink, I feel much more relaxed and easy-going. I am considering after my lunch break, to take a few shots to relax my mood. I will disguise it in a sprite bottle so no one knows and I will make sure to control myself so that I just get a light buzz and it won't affect my work performance. I was wondering if any of you drink while on the job to deal with the stress and depression?

I do enjoy drinking and I am starting to think maybe I won't start the dread work if I know that I can be relaxed by taking a few shots...what do you guys think?",False,nn2ntp,toastedasteroid,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nn2ntp/drinking_while_at_work_to_relieve_work_depression/,20,1

482,"In Labor Sectors, Why Are Bosses, Managers, Supervisors Needed?","In the very early 20th century (the teens and twenties and continuing into the 30's), if we look at the business press and various publications of the time, they were very worried... Terrified even... by a new kind of labor strike... The Sit-Down Strike! It began in U.S. steel production. Rather than protest and march to deliver grievances to capitalist bosses outside of factories, workers simply sat inside the factories and did nothing. They realized that THEY held all the power because they were the producers. Many of them began to question: ""Why do we need bosses? We have all the skills to produce everything ourselves. We can be the enterprisers and run everything. We can take over and own the factories collectively. **Why have bosses, managers, foremen etc.**"" From steel, it went into the garment industry. From there it moved into textiles, meat packing plants, machine shops and on and on. The popular phrase ""We know what to do, so why do we need you?"" took hold. Sit-downs became an effective tool and was predictably met by capitalist with the forced removal by cops. It was a scarier form of strike for the employers because the capitalists couldn't simply have workers killed, as they had done in the 19th century and so it was eventually driven out of them in various ways (mass firings, political repression etc.)

If workers do indeed know how to operate machines and run factories, why then are bosses necessary?",False,nmf5tc,Lucky_Strike-85,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nmf5tc/in_labor_sectors_why_are_bosses_managers/,3,1
483,"""Laziness Does Not Exist""","  The title refers to an essay that is in this sub-reddit's ""library"". 

I read it and was a bit surprised at its inclusion in the sub's library. The message of the essay is essentially that laziness does not exist, because any failure to work can be attributed to fixable barriers. In other words, the essay upholds the idea that healthy people want to work, and even work in the ways specifically administered by society, but encounter obstacles that prevent them from realizing this desire. In fact, the author states that ""lazy behavior is not an active choice"". 

To me, this message is not anti-work at all. It does not criticize modes of work or ideas about work. Instead it insists that individuals must (and want to) adapt themselves to working, and someone who flat out does not want to work is an aberration--ultimately not that much different from the original idea of laziness. But instead of pinning the blame on free will, the essay pins it on mental health or unfavorable circumstances.

484,New to this subreddit,"Hey all! Minor background on me: I’ve played hockey since I was little and still play, coach and do private lessons. I don’t really have an ambition to be the BEST COACH IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD but I want to pursue it as an art form. I get a ton of flac for quitting pretty much every single day job I get within 1-2 months. I don’t make a ton of money but it pays for rent and basic needs, and my girlfriend and I are happy.

This all sort of stems from a collective experience within my life totaling up to an ongoing epiphany that my life is for giving and loving. I can’t do that when I’m wasting my energy and resources at a job I detest, wondering what I COULD do with my vital, smart, capable self. Everyone said “get a job and contribute!” “You’re a strong young guy! “The world is yours!”

Anyway. I’m looking to release more attachments I have to this world and I’m a little nervous about releasing some things. So any advice to help me release attachments to stuff like comfort of material possessions, certain foods that aren’t healthy but make me feel good, media, etc, the usual things.

485,"How This System Works - We Lose, They Win","Work is basically an employer paying you, then you using that money to pay your expenses.

Most people live paycheck to paycheck, so the money their job pays them goes to pay their living expenses. 

It all boils down to this - Pay the workers as little as possible, make the expenses as high as possible, and take the workers labor, daily. Every day we work, they give some payment, and the payment is used to keep living. 

At the end of the day (or more like at the end of EVERY DAY) they win as they get our labor and the profits that come from it. And we stay, running on that treadmill, thinking one day we may make it.

It's cruel.

Is many of you know, | was recently laid off at Coast with a large part of my team. |
posted about it on Linkedin and | was amazed by the outpouring of support from
friends, colleagues, and my network at large. including many people I've never even
met.

Some people were indignant that Coast made me lay off my team since my role was
also impacted, but that’s not the case. Father, | asked to manage the comes across
my team, It's not what | wanted to do, but it was the best option given the
circumstances. It also signed with our of team commitment - ""To the right thing,
not the easy thing,”

Last forward a month and | was offered a great opportunity (nice people, more
money, bigger title, etc.), but it didn't feel like the right role for me. Given the state
of the economy and being the household breadwinner, taking the job would be the
easy thing to do, but that's not fair to anyone, so | declined.

While these notions aren't always at odds with one another, it might be worth
asking yourself - “Am | doing the right thing or the easy thing?”

490,I gave in my notice today,"Frequently my coworkers cock up and then feedback to my manager that somehow it was my fault (they do this to my teammates too). My manager tends to blame us without checking the truth of what actually happened. Usually it's not our/my mistake. I waste so much time finding evidence that it wasn't my fault and defending myself. 

Well today it happened one time too many so I really let him know what I thought. I previously fed back how I didn't like that false finger pointing but he just kinda ignored it (when I started he said he'd always have my back). But today I gave direct (not rude or personal) comments on how he fails to support his team (esp me) and that I can't take the blame culture anymore and I'm leaving.

He called me and said he would be sad to see me go, it's a shame, I'm a valued employee etc etc. He asked me to reconsider. By end of day **I retracted my resignation**. It pays decent and I can WFH. I can't be bothered to job hunt. I lost the guts and fury I had in the morning. Though I will say for myself it wasn't a kneejerk reaction, it's been bothering me for a while.

I felt bad when I gave my notice and bad when I withdrew it. At a previous job I felt nothing but euphoria at leaving but here I was so conflicted.

Anyway don't know where I'm going with this. I guess it'll never change. I dont know how this threat to leave will impact my work relationships.

495,Anyone feel like it's getting worse?,"I feel like in the company I'm in, everyone is being pushed to work more and more and more for less and less money. 

Also, the treatment of each person seems to be plummeting... treating each person as an output machine and not even holding back on saying it.  

All this while pushing to pay everyone less and under market value. 

For instance, HR says ""...this position should be a $100k team member..."" and management says, ""find a truly desperate soul to do it for $40K"".  It's horrific. 

* Cut budgets and achieve more. 
* Fire people and still hit all your ""numbers"".
* Have 8-10 hours of unproductive meetings every week but still do your job and produce the expected output. 
* Do NOT bring up the fact that the economy and COVID are still problems - the made up fucking numbers have to be hit, regardless.
* No one will care if you work more, after hours; just do all the work. NO ONE will thank you.

500,Is a high paying sales job the path off the path?,"I just found out that acquisition [salez] not only get higher base pay than I do working in retention but their commission payouts put them WELL into 6 figures. So I booked a meeting with the least salesy [read: least full of shit] sales guy I know at my company to learn about the role.

He has an associates degree in sports science or some shit. He went to a regional community college. I have a bachelor's degree related to our field which overlaps between IT and healthcare. I went to a top 25 public university.

He said he has never had to study our products in any meaningful way. He basically studied a three page script and learned powerpoint. When clients start asking technical questions he can't answer, he just brings someone from product on the meeting or punts the questions. I have to take numerous trainings and clients expect me to be a subject matter expert. When things don't work my boss wants me to prevent the client from talking to her. 

I'm on the phone or in meetings ALL. DAY. LONG. Often having to pull ten hour days + commute [pre covid]. He told me he takes a max of three meetings a day ""to stay sharp"". Furthermore, he let me know that since we have a finance team and legal team, he doesn't have to do any math or understand contracts. Someone reviews all his ""work"" after he plugs in numbers. In my role, I have to be able to explain nuances of 10+ page corporate legal jargon filled agreements for clients with any number of products and services.

I asked him what his workday looked like..

He wakes up around 8 AM and drives to the gym. Gets a workout in, showers, goes home. From there he decides if he wants to go into the office or work from home. Usually around 10 he will start checking emails or maybe have a meeting. He told me he has leads assigned to him from a more junior position that does all the cold calling. They schedule the meetings but he blocks his calendar off so he's only available between 11 am and 7 pm, with a max of 3 calls a day. In terms of duties, he has to manage the sales process after he qualifies the prospect and may have up to 20 or so prospects to worry about at a time. He said that aside from needing to be available for one off calls, his working day is about 6 hours long.

I made the mistake of asking him how much each deal is worth and he said they range from around $500 in his pocket to $5k+ once he hits his quarterly and monthly goals and starts getting payment MULTIPLIERS. He said if he hits his yearly goal early in the year, which about six or seven people do every year, he gets paid out double or more every sale.

This guy is in his late 20s, drives a brand new charger, has a gorgeous fiance, and told me he often gets asked to travel the country to ""schmooze big accounts and network"". Told me last year he took home $170k, but he ""wasn't really killing himself because he had a lot going on at home remodeling his basement for his man cave"".

Last night I splurged on new curtains for my apartment.

521,I got a small extra raise but now I want to leave anyway,"Hello! My annual salary talk was coming up and I decided to speak with my collegues to see what their salaries were. Turns out, I had the lowest salary by quite the margin.

I prepared and during my salary meeting with my boss I brought up that I wanted a one time pay bump. She was taken a back at first but then kind of agreed with me. Didnt promise anything though.

After two weeks I e-mailed her about it but I just got random corporate lingo. I pushed a little bit but then kind of gave up. I then started thinking about just quitting because I felt like I was in the right and that they need me more than I need them. 

Today she e-mailed me and said that I got a small extra pay increase ≈40 dollars per month. Its not what I wanted but something. However, I cant get the idea of just quitting out of my head. I feel no real anger or anything towards my boss. Gratitude really, she is a good boss.

Still, I just dont want to work.",False,nn4vok,Jesushadtoken,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nn4vok/i_got_a_small_extra_raise_but_now_i_want_to_leave/,7,1

535,Morality and Shame: self policing a destructive paradigm,"I like devoting my time to worthwhile pursuits. I would have loved to have been a father and raise a family but our entirely irresponsible standard of living has made that an impossibility for me... or at least a choice I could never live with, especially since I know my kids would grow to hate me for bringing them into a dying world. 

... which makes me wonder how it is that the generations that have taken a useful future from this planet for their comfort and toys can justify their obsession with people ""living up to their potential"". Potential to do what? Hoard resources and burn them to the point of creating a mass extinction? How are people still able to take pride in their work now that it's manifestly clear that this way of life that they're so certain is the right way, couldn't be more wrong... literally. If the way you live destroys the ability for future generations to do the same, you're living wrong objectively. It goes directly against the fundamental goal of life. 

I'd love to hear the struggles of others in how visceral people respond to the antiwork idea even as the world burns down under the burden of our consumption. I have no problem with work as long as the product of my efforts pushes things in a positive direction but I refuse to play this game where we competitively hoard wealth at each other and declare that as success. This all has to be undone if we're going to have a future that's livable. How do these people still have the stones to judge those that want their life to mean something, measured by more than the depth of the scar left on the planet after we leave. Do I really have to explain to these people why they've actually been scammed into policing their family for the greater machine that's raping the earth to death? I hold my tongue because I dont need to make someone else feel like shit for my life to have meaning but man am I ever tired of hearing about my potential. I'm aware of my potential and I'm also aware of the consequences of burning fossil fuels and spending money. I'm ready to start working to rebuild the living world at any time but I refuse to make this planet any worse than it is. The hubris and arrogance of it all is so nauseating.

544,Van Gogh is an anti-work hero.," For most his life all he spent his time doing was painting, even though he didn't really make any money off it. While alive he only sold like 1 painting, and it's said that his brother who supported him financially sent one of his friends to buy it to make Van Gogh feel better. His brother used to support him financially because he didn't have a job, all he did was paint and then once his brother got married and had also become a father and Van Gogh probably didn't want to be burden to his brother by having him keep financially supporting him so he instead of becoming a wage slave he decided to kill himself.

Unfortunately, people only started paying attention to his art after he died. These days just one of his paintings costs millions of dollars, but when he was alive he had little to no money. His story inspired me to write a song because I can relate to it seeing as I spend my time writing songs no one listens to instead of going to work, and I'd like to think that when I die more people will listen. The song is called ['Van Gogh'](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Aa72OMDhPBQUzhpqc40E7?si=826ec13ecef94d1d) (naturally) and it's one of my favourite songs from all the ones I've written.",False,nleglk,Jax_Gatsby,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nleglk/van_gogh_is_an_antiwork_hero/,2,1

565,A conversation overheard,"I was on a flight yesterday in the Midwest. The two men sitting behind me were chatting. Both were in their mid 40's and discussing how lazy ""kids"" are.

One of them said he was a restaurant owner that is short on workers and that he would gladly hire seven more workers, but nobody is applying that will work for under 15$. (What he means to say is they won't work for 7.25 per hour)

They then went on to talk about how asking for a 15$ minimum is ridiculous. He said that, ""if they cannot even make my McDonald's order corrextly, that is proof they don't deserve 15$"".

The nail in the coffin? They were agreeing and discussing about how only people with children are good workers. That people without children cannot be counted on to be on time, work hard, or not call in sick.

It took me all my will power to not say anything. These 3iq boomers deserved to be pimp slapped. I hope that their businesses fail miserably because they refuse to pay a decent age. It will be all their fault too. Then I hope their wives or husband's leave them because they are broke.

570,Anti work or anti job?,"I feel anti work isn't quite right and anti job is more accurate.  I know some people are fully anti work and don't want to do anything except (insert boomer voice) play video games all day.  But as we can see,  playing video games all day can be a perfectly valid and quite lucrative work opportunity.  
 My point is that work is not the problem.  There are people who would love to build houses,  but don't want to do it 10 hrs a day not making enough to afford one of their own.  Chefs who love to cook for people,  but burn out cooking for ungrateful customers 12hrs a day. 
 I'm sure there are dishwashers who are better writers, or artists or financial advisors than the professionals,  but have never had the opportunity to do what they are good at.  Instead they're stuck at a job doing what they have to rather than what they should. 
Everyone has something to contribute to society as a whole, but capitalism has trapped most of us at the job we need just to keep surviving.

BUT, they have terrible benefits and a terrible culture. I'm worried about ever being able to provide for my family and be happy at a job that pays similarly, but I cannot take it anymore. I work so much I barely have time for my family and can't find a more reasonable job for this kind of pay.

You might be committing time clock fraud!

 

Time clock fraud occurs whenever an employee does something while
punched in that is unrelated to work (while not on a 15 minute break).

of:
of

Were are some easy-to-do tips to avoid committing time clock fraud:

e Use the restroom before you start work and before coming back from meals.

e Take sure to take off your coat/jacket, or other outer pieces before munching in.

e Take sure to secure personal items in a locked before munching in.

e Arrive early to ensure you have the time to complete any shopping or other tasks before
your schedule start time.

e Once punched in, you are on the clock and should immediately grab your equipment
and head to the sales floor.

Of 10 employees commit 10 minutes of time clock fraud a day, that’s 100

minutes a day. That’s 3,000 minutes a month which equals 50 hours of
Payroll lost.

 

Please remember that time clock fraud can lead to disciplinary action and
termination.

Went to a job interview for a sales position today for what I was told was a great company to work for. The pay was $500.00/week salary with a possibility of a commission which caps out not much past that. I thought ""okay I can work with that if I have to"". So I asked the manager what the hours looked like. Keep in mind this company was an hour commute one way for me. She said ""well M-f 8am to 6 pm with a few nights past 8pm and every other weekend with no additional pay"". I had a bewildered look on my face I guess because she said ""the owner works lots of hours here so he expects you to also.""

582,"I'm on ""sabbatical"" but I don't think I can go back.","In February I decided to take a sabbatical from work as a software engineer. I had been in the field for a decade. It seemed like every project I worked on got tossed in the trash either shortly after completion or without being completed.

I tried to fix it by going part time, but I was still exhausted and a little suicidal. I had stopped trying, every meeting was just me making excuses about the poor progress of my work. I'm sure some of my coworkers looked down on me. As the most experienced engineer on my team, I couldn't get the tiniest thing done. I think subconsciously I was trying to get fired and hoping they would be willing to consider it a layoff and I would get unemployment.

I finally quit because I was trying to decide between killing myself and being unemployed. And I didn't even have it that bad from a conditions standpoint. Pay was decent for the field and location, especially considering I did fuck all for about six months. My coworkers and direct bosses were nice. I just literally couldn't make myself do the work, I felt constantly guilty, and the upper management was doing some unethical shady shit. The shady shit was actually kind of nice, because it gave me a good excuse for my friends and family as to why I left an ""amazing"" job.

I've been unemployed for almost three months, which is the point at which I said I would start looking for a job. I just can't do it. I can't go back to doing a project I don't care about that I don't trust will even be used for eight hours a day five days a week, only interrupted by meetings that are arguably worse than the work.

I'm trying to figure out what to do now. I have savings that will get me through a little while. I've been doing mturk and various survey sites for some money. I have some ideas for apps that I could write and I could do some freelance work, once the idea of writing code again no longer makes me nauseated. I could tutor computer science, though I'm not sure students would appreciate me whispering ""it's a trap!!""

I would even be willing to work minimum wage for a while.
I know that sucks in a different way but at least when I worked at a fast food place the nature of the work meant I couldn't procrastinate a two week task into the last three hours before the deadline. Plus no one expects you to have a two year tenure minimum at a place before quitting and moving on.

If I have a point, I guess it's this: I worked in good conditions and I was still miserable. Because I didn't have enthusiasm for the things I was working on. And if I did, it might have been even worse when it all got trashed in the end.

I'm now occasionally a happy person. I don't want to die, so that's something. The things I do work on end with a tangible end product that I get to decide what happens with it, or someone gets clear benefit for something I did for them.

I worked my whole life to be rich and useless, where my company basically got paid for my butt to be in a chair whether or not I did anything. But I would rather be poor and useful to my community.

586,Companies abuse and lie to junior employees with non-competes to intimidate them - it's legal,"Non compete agreements are complicated things. They might make sense in the ""Don Draper - Mad Men"" situation that they were built for - if you are a company that relies on talent and pay them massive amounts of money, you want to protect yourself from poaching from direct competitors. There are a few other situations where they make sense, but generally it should only be 'acceptable' if a significant amount of a business' performance relies on a handful of talent and that talent is compensated accordingly. 

That being said - non competes are vile. If an individual has committed themselves to a field of expertise to the extent that many companies want to pick them up, that's a value they've earned. Companies should encentivize talent to stay, not control their lives and options and potentially ruin them in the event of a termination.

Today, non competes feel as standard as non disclosure clauses. Even in situations where they are not enforceable - for example, in California non competes cannot be enforced at all - companies will still put them in. Junior employees who are lining up to become wage slaves do not have the tools to understand all labor law and can't push back against abusive and unenforceable clauses. Even if you bring up an abusive clause like a non-compete as an intern, they tell you it's mandatory and part of any job. 

These companies don't even need to enforce these EVER. 80% of their employees likely will respect these clauses because they think that they are binding because they signed them. The worst is that even when you agree to play the work game, the system applies methods to make your work life harder and more stressful. They can ruin your life, just for continuing to find work in the field you've been practicing in because it might lightly affect their revenues.

NEVER trust HR, legal counsel, or management within a company. They NEVER have your interests in mind. They WILL try to manipulate and intimidate you from the get go to ensure their bottom line is protected. They will underpay you, prevent you from growing, and write you off entirely if you stray from their ideal path.

And remember that companies are allowed to put unenforceable clauses in your contract, they just are not allowed to enforce them. If 9/10ths of employees comply with a fraudulent non-compete, that's good enough for them. Understand the clauses you are signing and don't let a corporation intimidate you. Nothing is valid just because you've signed it...

So I have bad anxiety and a little bit of depression, OCD, tend to think in black and white. Etc. I’m 25 years old, male, single, with zero student loan debt and a job that doesn’t pay a lot. I can afford rent and bills but saving money is tough. 

My apartment complex is pristine. No crime, friendly people, no issues with bugs or rodents EVER. I pay a lot for rent but it’s worth the quality of what I pay for.

I make nothing compared to my friend group. They’re all nurses and engineers. All of them make at least 55K a year and have a roommate/spouse to fall back on so they’re in great spots. I have nobody. 

I’m not saying woe is me, but I’m so hyper focused on comparing myself to them that it makes me uneasy and I can’t enjoy life. I’ve been dirt poor before and want to ensure it never happens again. I’m not struggling at all, but I can’t help but see everything when I go out promoting “new car! Buy a home! Buy this!” So on and so forth.

It’s disgusting. It almost trains your brain to always be trying to be productive and better than your neighbor. It’s a fucking barbaric cult of people wanting new new new and materialism. 

In reality, none of these things make me happy. But surrounded by these things on a daily basis makes it hard to fight. Why can’t we all just live? Why is it always about trying to be efficient and productive 24/7?

One variable that is very difficult to quantify, but if quantified, could potentially turn the entire calculation on its head.

**Bullshit jobs.**

You see, when you measure up how much money would it cost to give every American / Dutch / Hungarian citizen eligible to vote 1000 USD / 1000 EUR / 100 000 HUF per month, yes, it will come out as more expensive than the existing social security systems, **BUT**....

What if we counted the salary and cost of bullshit jobs as part of social security, as welfare? Think about it. Those jobs don't create real value - in fact, very often, they destroy it. Yes, on paper, you are employed and getting paid for it, but because your job doesn't any real value, your salary is basically unemployment subsidies with extra steps. You're no different from a welfare-recepient, except that you have much less free time.

Maybe if we also factored in the cost of bullshit jobs, UBI would in fact come out as much cheaper in the end?

Examples of bullshit jobs include:

* Marketing, advertisement

They looked genuinely confused, like they'd never thought about it. Later in the second interview with management and also online with the recruiter, everyone said the company couldn't tell me what benefits I'd get until I signed their contract.

I did some math and even making 10k more, I would actually have less net income because of all the expenses that job required - my current job at the time had the best benefits like free gym access, 11% retirement match, and HSA contributions (employer paid 50% of my deductible into my HSA!). I told the corporate machine that I couldn't accept the job if they weren't transparent with me about it, and that ended up being the deal breaker. I think they offered me another 10k boost, but still couldn't tell me if I'd even have health insurance. I think I said something like ""no, really.

619,Dream Jobs,"I've seen a fair few posts here that criticize the notion of a dream job, but I have to strongly disagree and I want to open a discussion about this.

This sub should focus on how many work environments are toxic and that there is a sick mentality in most of the world regarding the role of labor in society. The notion of labor itself is not the issue though. There is nothing inherently wrong with labor or even wanting to work - it is when you have no choice but to work (else die) or your employer undervalues and mistreats you wherein problems exist.

If you have a deep desire to teach, to heal, to discover through research, or other such pursuits, then work may very well be the best path towards reaching those dreams. If you want to teach, being a teacher or professor will offer you the best opportunities to do so. If you want to heal, being a nurse or a doctor will allow you to do so. In that sense, it's not the job that's the dream, but what you are able to achieve through that work.

Of course, not everyone has such a dream that is best realized through a job. If you want to create art, employment may not offer you the best path towards realizing this goal. If you want  to explore nature, a job might not best give you the opportunities to do so. That's not to say that jobs that allow you to freely follow these dreams don't exist, but they're not inherently the best paths towards doing so.

In summary, this community shouldn't be so critical of the notion of a dream job. Labor is important, and people who pursue their dreams through work play an important role in our society. It is only the notion that you must have a dream job which should be abandoned, as not all dreams are best realized through labor.

I'm not scared of vaccines and I'm generally pro vax, but I have mildish anxiety about going to new places and doing new things. Just answering questions and standing in line etc make me kinda nervous and I just want to get it over with. The problem with that is... it's at the end of my time off so I'll be waiting for my time off to end so I can get the vaccine. 

This really bothers me. I already spend every fucking day waiting for it to end. I basically will keep waiting tilI I've waited my life away. I don't want to, but I just always wait during work. Its become so intense that the feeling of waiting now triggers me when I'm not at work. So I really don't want to feel like waiting during time off. It spoils it and makes it feel like work.

Sadly I cannot rebook unless it's months away and I don't want that. Is there any way I can just... manipulate into not wanting it over with and not waiting?

Does anyone else get me? I really fucking hate work so intensely it's made me weird in some ways. Nobody understands why it's devastating to tarnish precious free time with worky waity feeling.

679,What Is A Bullshit Job?,"&gt;Kurt: The German military has a subcontractor that does their IT work.  
&gt;  
&gt;The IT firm has a subcontractor that does their logistics.  
&gt;  
&gt;The logistics firm has a subcontractor that does their personnel management, and I work for that company.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's say soldier A moves to an office two rooms farther down the hall. Instead of just carrying his computer over there, he has to fill out a form.  
&gt;  
&gt;The IT subcontractor will get the form, people will read it and approve it, and forward it to the logistics firm.  
&gt;  
&gt;The logistics firm will then have to approve the moving down the hall and will request personnel from us.  
&gt;  
&gt;The office people in my company will then do whatever they do, and now I come in.  
&gt;  
&gt;I get an email: ""Be at barracks B at time C."" Usually these barracks are one hundred to five hundred kilometers \[62-310 miles\] away from my home, so I will get a rental car. I take the rental car, drive to the barracks, let dispatch know that I arrived, fill out a form, unhook the computer, load the computer into a box, seal the box, have a guy from the logistics firm carry the box to the next room, where I unseal the box, fill out another form, hook up the computer, call dispatch to tell them how long I took, get a couple of signatures, take my rental car back home, send dispatch a letter with all of the paperwork then get paid.  
&gt;  
&gt;So instead of the soldier carrying his computer for five meters, two people drive for a combined six to ten hours, fill out around fifteen pages of paperwork, and waste a good four hundred euros of taxpayers' money.

This might sound like a classic example of ridiculous military red tape of the sort Joseph Heller made famous in his 1961 novel *Catch-22*, except for one key element: almost nobody in this story actually works for the military. Technically, they're all part of the private sector. There was a time, of course, when any national army also had its own communications, logistics, and personnel departments, but nowadays it all has to be done through multiple layers of private outsourcing.

701,"[WAGE THEFT] Average minimum wage violation was $64 per week or $3,300 per year for a year-round worker—nearly a quarter of the worker’s earned wages—and affected 17% of low-wage workers....4X the FBI’s $13 billion total annual value of all robberies, burglaries, larceny, and motor vehicle thefts","Wage theft and weaker enforcement of labor standards
Many workers, particularly low-wage workers and the women and men of color who are disproportionately in this category, frequently fail to receive the wages they are owed.31 This is referred to as “wage theft” and reflects workers being paid below the minimum wage, not being paid for all hours worked, not being paid time-and-a-half though legally eligible for overtime, experiencing illegal deductions from pay, and having their tips stolen by employers or supervisors. A recent example involved Amazon, which agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $61.7 million because it shorted its drivers tips over a two-and-a-half-year period starting in late 2016 (Greene 2021).

How extensive is wage theft? The available information shows the problem is pervasive. The best analysis is from a 2008 study of 4,387 workers in low-wage industries in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York; it found that two-thirds of workers surveyed experienced at least one pay-related violation in any given week. The average violation amounted to 15% of earnings (Bernhardt, Milkman, and Theodore 2009).

Another study (Cooper and Kroeger 2017) examined the wage theft affecting minimum wage workers in the 10 most populous states (accounting for more than half the national workforce); it found that total wages stolen from workers due to minimum wage violations alone exceeds $15 billion annually on a national basis. ***The average minimum wage violation amounted to $64 per week or $3,300 per year for a year-round worker—nearly a quarter of the worker’s earned wages—and affected 17% of low-wage workers.*** The authors detail who was affected:

Young workers, women, people of color, and immigrant workers are more likely than other workers to report being paid less than the minimum wage, but this is primarily because they are also more likely than other workers to be in low-wage jobs. In general, low-wage workers experience minimum wage violations at high rates across demographic categories. In fact, the majority of workers with reported wages below the minimum wage are over 25 and are native-born U.S. citizens, nearly half are white, more than a quarter have children, and just over half work full time.

A back-of-the-envelope estimate, extrapolating from the Bernhardt, Milkman, and Theodore (2009) study, suggests that by 2016 aggregate wage theft was on the order of $52 billion annually (McNicholas, Mokhiber, and Chaikof 2017). This estimate does not include the stealing of tips where the wage received is nevertheless the minimum or violations of prevailing wage laws. This understated estimate of aggregate wage theft is, nonetheless, four times greater than the FBI’s $13 billion estimate of the total annual value of all robberies, burglaries, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

Other insights can be gleamed by identifying the amounts recovered in wage theft suits and enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Labor, by states, and through class action settlements. McNicholas, Mokhiber, and Chaikof (2017) did so and found $880.3 million in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2016, for a total of $2 billion over both years. This estimate, according to the researchers, likely dramatically underrepresents the problem of wage theft, since probably only a fraction of victims actually file government complaints or are involved in class action settlements.

Shierholz (2021) details the reasons for the prevalence of wage theft:

One reason is workers’ diminished bargaining power relative to their employers. The fact that this unlawful employer behavior is not being “competed away” underscores that, for a variety of reasons, workers do not have the ability to quit these jobs as a de facto form of enforcement.

Another reason is that government resources devoted to combating violations of workplace protections are insufficient and have diminished. For instance, at the federal level, Shierholz writes: “In 1978, there were 69,000 workers per wage and hour investigator on average, but today that ratio is 175,000 to one.” The increased use of forced arbitration agreements, as detailed in a later section, has prevented workers from holding their employers accountable both in court and in the private arbitrations they are forced to use (frequently without the ability to do so as a class). As Shierholz (2021) notes:

To underscore the importance of class-action lawsuits in our enforcement framework: in 2015 and 2016, the top 10 private wage and hour class-action settlements alone exceeded the combined total wages recovered by all state and federal enforcement agencies. Forced arbitration with class and collective action waivers make it virtually impossible for low-wage workers to get any meaningful type of remedy.

Last, declining unionization enables more wage theft to go unchallenged. In effect, nearly every option workers have of holding employers accountable for stealing their wages has eroded in recent years: There is less protection through government enforcement, weaker access to legal recourse, and far less union advocacy in workplaces.

How much does wage theft affect wages in the middle and at the bottom? We do not have an estimate of aggregate wage theft across the wage spectrum or for middle-wage workers, so it is not possible to assess the impact of wage theft on the median wage. Among low-wage workers, Bernhardt, Milkman, and Theodore (2009) found that 68% experience wage theft violations averaging 14.95% of earnings. This translates into an average loss across all low-wage workers of 10.2%.32 Even this estimate omits certain types of wage theft, and we do not know how representative the study’s sample is of the national low-wage workforce. Nevertheless, the Bernhardt, Milkman, and Theodore study indicates that wage theft drains a substantial amount of low-wage workers’ earnings. We also do not know the extent of wage theft’s growth over the 1979–2017 period, though researchers judge that there has been substantial growth. A speculative estimate is that if wage theft has doubled to the 10.2% level implied by the Bernhardt, Milkman, and Theodore study, then it caused low-wage workers’ earnings to fall 5% over the 1979–2017 period due to weaker wage standards enforcement, less access to legal recourse, and eroded unionization. For mid-level wages, theft of overtime pay, unpaid worktime, and the undercutting of prevailing wages likely also had an adverse impact.",False,nlyhen,MakeTotalDestr0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nlyhen/wage_theft_average_minimum_wage_violation_was_64/,5,1

723,Worst internship experience ever pushed me to consider entrepreneurship,"I just turned 19 and joined several internships where the management turned out to be blatantly verbally abusive,  micromanaging and aggressive, to the point where it severely affected my mental health. The sheer sense of entitlement as if they literally owned you and making you answer and explain yourself to them when you did nothing wrong. Months of this bullshit forced me to a breaking point where realised I don’t ever want to be stuck in a position where I have to constantly walk on eggshells around my manager or boss, or have to answer to people all the time and explain myself to them. Imagine the sense of freedom and empowerment that comes with going to work for yourself at your own fucking pace and space and nobody can micromanage your work and tell you what you should or should not do, that’s the kind of career I want to build for myself and not dream of working for some insecure fuck who constantly berates you to assert dominance.",False,nknp2i,hazelseas,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nknp2i/worst_internship_experience_ever_pushed_me_to/,7,1
724,I need advice about quitting.,"I've been working at dollar general since January and it was my first Job but I don't like this place anymore.  I tried telling management I plan on quitting but she just tried to convince me ""I can get more hours and positions"" and etc and tried to convince me to give a two weeks notice and call.

But thing is.  They are barely giving me any hours at all. 
This entire week I only work today, only one shift for this week.  And next week I only have two days, same for the next. And they keep taking me out of the schedule and replacing me with someone else, sometimes last second.  


The only reason I feel guilty about just walking out is the fact I'm too considerate of others. And I'm also worried about the ""you can't use as a reference"" thing.  

I'm just so tired of the place and it's bs.  And as is I barely get paid anything and I feel like no one notices when I work harder or try my best.  If they do they just toss more task on me.

728,I suffer from inner conflict between hating or liking capitalism,"The title says it all. I see how unjust capitalism truly is in the US but at the same time feel the urge to put a ton of effort into making it work for me as best as possible. 

You really cannot make any big strides forward in life without owning assets of some sort. The average person is getting priced out of valuable assets now. Wages are stagnant due to greedy corporations while the cost of living keeps increasing. They would rather have internal operations be on the brink of collapse by laying off labor instead of cutting from the 1% or resolving the actual issues of why the company isn’t performing well. Going to college puts you in debt up to your eyeballs immediately at the starting line of your true adult life. We work day in and day out untIl we can MAYBE retire. The list goes on and on and I hate everything about it.

However, there really does not seem to be any other alternative other than forfeiting yourself to the system. All the people who preach their “escape the rat race” mantra most likely exploited capitalism to the max. Most people will never have the opportunities to even THINK about leaving the capitalist grind. I do not know if we’ll ever see us move away from capitalism so I feel like I must learn to like it in order to climb out of the struggle.

jokes on them too, i lowkey radicalized a coworker after i quit. when my coworker asked me why i did it, i was straight up and said “they kinda underpay us”, pointed out how a meal at our restaurant costs more than we are paid an hour. apparently that really got to them, they’re now looking for a new job so they can quit too lmao 

i don’t even know what i’ll do next, but i have enough saved that i’m promising myself that unless it comes down to me *needing* it desperately, i’m not gonna do that shit to myself ever again. i get its privileged to even have an option to escape, but i’ll be damned if i don’t take it, just as if i didn’t have the choice i’d still hope anyone who can does the same. life is finite, and worth so much more than a few bucks an hour... idk tho, i do feel guilty about that i’m the one to have the option/ i feel like others deserve it more tbh

745,"After being curious about the sub for a long time, I have finally become anti-work, due to an increasingly rediculous situation of gross negligence and nepotism at my job.","I (22m) work as a care attendant at a home for mentally  disabled people. There are a few homes in the area I work at, taking shifts as needed. One home is actually an apartment for a single man who was to violent and unpredictable to be left with other residents.

There is one worker at this home that I have no idea how they still have a job. Multiple cases of violating patient rights. Reports of texting and driving. Calling in sick almost once a week, and more. Being a care position, this type of behavior just isn't acceptable and that's made clear when you are hired. It's actually against the law, and in my mind should result in immediate termination. See, we are always short staffed, so I assumed the lack of consiquences was due to a fear of the inability to fill the position. It's somewhat valid, but also in my mind negligent to leave the resident in their care knowing their history, just because filling the position is hard. (My company pays 13 an hour btw, well below living wage here.) But, no, turns out my boss is their brother. See, if all of the reports of their conduct had actually turned into write ups, they would have lost the ""three strikes you're out"" game long ago. 

So, a few days ago, a comcerned neighbor tells me the bad employee left out resident alone in the apartment *on the balcony* to go talk to their friends in the parking lot. We are not allowed to leave them unsupervised, they can be in a different room, but we have to be in the same building. Nothing bad happened, but that is a huge no-no. If something did happen, it would be a huge deal, this person would probably go to jail for negligence, the program would go under investigation and could be shut down. If it was found that I knew about a case of negligence and didn't report it I could very well be charged as well. 

I don't like causing trouble, I am very much a person who wants everyone to like me, so I go back and forth on reporting. I mean, nothing did happen. I hate feeling like a narc. Eventually I tell myself it's the right thing to do. I email my boss saying this is the situation, please talk to them about the rules. My boss then emails me back saying he accidentally forwarded my email to the person I complained about. 

Let me just say, I do really like my boss. I think they are an extremely good person, and an extremely good manager. I struggle to say they did this on purpose. If it wasn't for the family relation it wouldn't even cross my mind. My boss has expressed they are upset with their sibling over their actions multiple times to me. I am rather certain there is nepotism, but I just don't know how far it goes. 

So now this is the situation I am in. I can't quit my job or move to another department. I am going back to college in just a couple months and won't get hired elsewhere. I need the money. I could report my boss and the whole situation to HR, but then all I get is everyone mad at me.  Almost all management are friends with eachother and me reporting my well liked boss would surely make everyone upset. I am graduating college soon and need the good reference to start my career. I was even going to use this boss as a letter of recommendation. I am expected to just go back to work and act like nothing happened, like there isn't something majorly wrong with a company who can continuously employ someone who's technically committed crimes under your employment by violating the patients rights.

A lot of this stems from them only paying 13 an hour. We can't hire anybody when every target, walmart, and mcdonald's pays 2 dollars an hour more. Turn over is constant. It isn't an easy job, so many people start and quit before they even finish all their training. We hire anyone without a criminal record. We can't fire the bad employees when they are all we have. I've seen the finances and know we could be paying more rather easily. Someone is getting rich, which is weird because we are mostly government sponsored. Furthermore this company would throw you under the bus at a moment's notice. Accidents happen, especially when you are one person taking care of four disabled people all with strict medication scheduals, health conditions, and behavioral issues. You just aren't going to do everything perfect. This company would throw you to the wolves to save itself. Let you be criminally processed although they are the ones who don't hire enough skilled help. 

It disgusts me that someone is getting rich off of providing mediocre care to disabled people. That abuse and negligence (even though it's ""minor"") is being swept under the rug. And it's so easy too. We hire so many pot heads and deadbeats it's like I'm the only one who can see what's happening. They are happy doing the bare minimum and ignoring what's wrong. They can sit on their phone all day and ignore the residents because everyone else is either just as lazy or you're the only person on staff.

746,It’s not the actual subject that I absolutely hate but work culture itself,"After having worked in so many job roles from finance to tech to teaching, I realized that it’s not the actual subject/industry that I despise but everything OTHER than it.  I’m not stupid, in fact I pick up things very fast if I have the motivation, but every job has always killed that enthusiasm in me and I end up hating a subject I once loved. I hate how our dumbass modern work culture is so obsessed with profit, productivity, and competition Nothing is ever enough.

I hate reporting to a boss and living in constant fear that my livelihood depended on their opinion of me and their interpretation of my performance. 

I hate dealing with sucky incompetent bosses with giant egos who never like to admit they’re wrong but have no problem criticizing me. 

I hate dealing with coworkers and being forced to engage in soul draining office politics. 

I hate the meetings where everyone in the room is debating endlessly and trying to shove their idea down people’s throats. 

I hate dealing with the pointless and suffocating company bureaucracy and “values”.

I hate hustle culture and glorifying “going above and beyond” as a standard. 

I hate pretending that I loooove working for the company and their pointless mission. 

I hate that I can’t truly be friends with my coworkers and everyone’s suspicious of each other because the nature of the workplace has naturally pitted us against each other from the start. 

I hate anything to do with performance reviews because it’s an opportunity for coworkers to talk shit about each other while padding their own accomplishments.

I hate the bullshit job hunting and interview process. Wasting your precious time filling out over 200 applications with useless cover letters and only hearing back from less than 5 should not be normal. 

Companies making you feel like you need THEM to survive doesn’t feel right. 

The fact that society tells you there are only certain ways to have a good life (get a high paying STEM job) and that your self worth is based on your job title is wrong. 

The fact that public education sets you up to be a good office drone by judging you purely on grades instead of your interests and potential pisses me off. 

I hate it when people say “deal with it. That’s just the way life is.” 

I want to be able to walk outside at 2pm and enjoy the sunshine during one of the nicest times of the day, but I can’t because I’m stuck at work. 

I want to be able to focus on my health and mental well being instead of constantly feeling stressed, but I can’t because I’m stuck at work. 

I want to be able to spend time with my loved ones during the day. In the end, it is then who will care about me. Those duds at work could care less if I got his by a bus and died. They’d just hire someone to replace me. 

I wish I had time to spend on my hobbies and pursue what I really want to do without having the thought of being financially poor loom over me 

I feel like I’m just wasting my prime years slaving away for someone else when I could be out meeting new friends and going on fun dates instead of catching up on sleep and chores on the weekend 

I’m tired of feeling tired and depressed all the time because of work.

764,"Pension schemes, I resent them wholeheartedly","In the last say, 6 months, I received letters from 2 different pension companies that I completely forgot about. One with about £600 the other with £800. Now round about this time I had injured my knee, and was borrowing money due to the fucked up lockdowns.
Really got me resenting them for wafting this in my face at such a tough time. That I had to put in mandatory 3% matched by the employer (so let's say £300 and £400). And by the time I get access to this money it will be worth peanuts due to inflation. 

Of course I may or may not have already spent the money if it hadn't have been put away in the first place but now that it is there AND it's my money AND I really need it, why should I feel so eager and honoured to break down my mind and body for like £9 per hour in the form of *vomits* work?",False,nksncz,HugoDosser,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nksncz/pension_schemes_i_resent_them_wholeheartedly/,11,1
765,Why is working for the non-corporate sector not an option?,"I am genuinely curious - is working for the non profit/ social work/ care / development sector something that you guys consider? I feel like this does not get talked about as an alternative in any post. After two soul crushing years I have sworn to never work in the private for-profit sector ever again. I now work in international development and I know I am making way less money than I could in the corporate sector, but for me this was my only option as I was loosing my will to live in this meaningless mashine. I know I was privileged to be able to get a good education and get this job and have noone that depends on my income but myself, but there are so many other low threshold options if you want (or need) to escape the corporate sector.

770,Applications are the biggest scam.,"I have to say, that I hate work, and we all should do something to reduce the pain of work, and the work hours for all people. 8 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week? Minimum wage? Wtf.

But on top of that, applications are a scam. I mean, unfortunately everybody has to work except wealthy people, but for other people there are just two options starve or work till you die.

Let’s be real and let’s say you find a job, which you find acceptable, I mean there is nothing, which anybody would like to do their whole life for money and for 8 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week, but I think there are jobs, where you could accept the fact that you’ll slave your life away. I mean it’s just hard facts, and there is no other way around it.

I applied for 10 jobs, and at every job which I applied to I got rejected. There was no further explanation why that was the case, in most cases I just got an automatically generated email. Applications are such a scam, because you have to beg to get a job, even though you maybe don’t wanna work, but they literally expect you that you write that you are highly motivated and all that but in reality you aren’t. 

I mean 10 jobs, that’s not that much, but I mean it’s just so fucking absurd, I don’t know how to explain it, but I mean at this moment there isn’t even any other job in my near, where I could accept the fact that I would slave my life away. And even though, I would say I’m open for every job, which I have to be at some point unfortunately, then there are jobs which require 5 years of experience in the exact field, wtf? And I’m not willing to drive 2 hours to the office or something like that. More companies could give their employees the opportunity to do home office, but nope…

775,Fired from first corporate job,"Just need to rant. I'm not really sad about it, mostly in panic mode right now trying to find another job while not knowing what I'd actually somewhat enjoy doing + who will even want to train me. I'm 22 btw with 4 years of work experience (mix of IT and clerical jobs during/after college) so still pretty entry level I suppose. 

This job was wrecking me mentally. I was a client coordinator at a real estate office, which in this company meant receptionist with extra steps (filing, basic administrative duties, etc). Pretty average and not difficult but the environment is what eventually got me dragging myself to work every day. Everyone was so goddamn negative to each other, talking crap behind others backs (including clients)  etc so it would be no surprise if they did that to me because I was let go after 3 months! Even though I was to go through a 90 day probation period! Last Thursday they let me work most of the day and called me into HR to fire me at 3:30. Just to pack my shit and leave basically, here's your last paycheck bye bye. 

Up until that point my supervisor and coworker who trained me said I was doing well and kept hyping up the ""upward mobility"" and ""great things"" that go on there. Neither of them were there when I met the chopping block. According to the HR woman, I was being let go ""because of things [supervisor] and others were saying and it's just not working out"". Can anyone explain what this means??? Huh??

Maybe I'm just a little startled because it's my first time like I said. I'm still learning that people being nice to my face at work means nothing apparently. I'm trying my best not to judge future jobs based on this one, but I have a feeling it'll always be like this and I have to be extremely careful and always assume I'm going to be let go for just about any reason or non-reason.

782,A work-free society also for low income countries?,"Hey everyone, I am new here and hope I can post this question here. I love all the images, quotes and memes people post here as I have been intrigued with the thought of a work-free life for quite some time now. I love reading about the success of four day work weeks and similar experiments as they are giving me hope that there is indeed change ahead, even if it’s at a very slow pace. I can realistically imagine that work-free living can become a reality in high income countries, like the US and most of Europe with the adoption of a universal basic income, taxes on machines and so on. But how would this work for low income countries? For example most African countries. How would they generate so much income when automation is not even close to the same level as in the West?

(PS: Just to clarify, when I say work-free I don’t mean no work at all. I just mean that people no longer need to work to survive and have basic necessities because they get a basic income from the state. This frees them up to pursue whatever it is they want to pursue and of course, lots of people will still end up working but on different terms.)",False,nkgq03,jazzautke,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nkgq03/a_workfree_society_also_for_low_income_countries/,1,1

786,Accessable self employment instead of UBI/benefits?,"The work itself never pisses me off. It’s the atmosphere, the lack of control and being under the thumb of an apparent cabal of psychopaths all working in conjunction to torture the most humane of us. 

So, what if their was a job you couldn’t really get fired from? You want a break, you take a break? You want a day off, you take a day off. Never even have to ask anyone, you just make that choice.

It’s the freedom that western society champions, along with the capitalist nature of earning your keep. It’s very nature could never be compared to socialism or communism so even the hardest right would be stretched for a reason to fight against it. 

What if our government’s had an endless supply of work that needed doing, and instead of creating a nationalised industry or outsourcing to conglomerates, they instead created the “uber” of this industry. You just show up and get paid per work unit done. Self employment where the government is your customer, accessible to all and job security for life.

Companies would lose their teeth. No more fear culture. No more bullying, only incentives. 

I call this change ‘the great redundancy of psychopaths’ because they’d lose their control over us. 

The only problem with self employment is the uncertainty, a limitless supply of government work would rectify that.
You’d be more comfortable financing things and taking loans you know you can repay. 

Sure the lack of sick pay, and PTO sucks but that’s why you save and take short term zero interest loans. It’s the price for freedom.

Plus it’d be funny to watch the likes of Bezos to cry when an even tougher labour shortage is generated.

(Not sure how this would work in America though, in terms of health care. You’d probably have to put in some additional hours (at your own pace without pressure and get private health insurance).

787,86'd (Good as Gone),"I was terminated from my retail management position this morning. I had been at the position for two years. Naturally, there is a tempest of thoughts and emotions I am processing. I have to file for UI benefits, look for a new position in a hostile hiring environment, figure out my already impossible budget-- how I am going to pay for my overburdened rent, feed myself and my cat, and pay for the mortgage on the car I had to buy last month when some asshole totaled out my car that was mere months away from being paid-off in full...

But more than any of these technicalities that go along with a sudden deprivation of income, I feel liberated. These budget issues were all endemic even while I was employed, so not knowing how I am going to cover my expenses is far from a new experience. But my disillusion with employment had been mounting for weeks now, and I often looked at the mountain of work I had to complete outside of my job and wondered what I could achieve if I wasn't indentured to my job. I felt trapped in my current rental lease and in the city I live in, being beholden to a management position that I felt entitled to excel at.

If anything, being fired is an unprecedented opportunity. I have the chance to fulfill my aspirations. I can go anywhere, do anything, that I desire.

788,restaurant industry horror stories,"This Antiwork group got me thinking about every boss that has ever done me wrong, and how I just bent over and took it. Here is my ""I finally had enough"" story. 

 During college I was working two jobs at once, both in the restaurant industry. I worked m-f mornings at a breakfast place and Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday mornings at a bar. It was set up this way for months until the bar I worked at decided to put their children's BOYFRIENDS in charge. Neither one of these dudes had ever worked a day in their lives. They were college football jock straps and spent their time at work watching football at the bar with the regulars. This of course being anyone else other than the boyfriends of the bosses kids, would be unacceptable. 

Long story short, said boyfriends start making the schedules and completely fuck everything up for everyone. They ended up scheduling me for a morning shift Friday (without asking or telling me), and I did not see it until it was too late. My schedule had been the same for MONTHS and checking it was never something I had to do because everyone there knew of my m-f job. I called and told them I couldn't work that because I was already at my other job and they straight up told me that I would be ""punished"" for not being available for the changing schedule. The next day I go in for my Saturday night shift and the boyfriend takes me into the office and writes me up for "" no call no showing, and having a shitty attitude"" I was never once disrespectful to anyone and have always been know as a shy and quiet girl. He was not even the guy I spoke to when I called about not being able to work that shift. The owner was there that day and I went to him and told him how the guy talked to me. He then proceeded to tell me "" I deserved it"" I walked out and blocked their numbers.

Each day that goes by, I become more and more bitter about the way society operates.

I'm a person, not a tax dollar. I'm independent, not selfish. I'm adventurous, not flighty. I've let the government and mega-corporations tell me how to live; I've let doctors medicate me so I can cope with how I'm supposed to live.

801,Is there an escape?,"Currently live in the US. I have a college degree but I'm working at a company trying to build up hours to apply to grad school with experience. 

I work 40 hours a week, but my schedule isn't set due to the nature of my work. I finally got a set schedule and am working out the kinks of it. I switched from 8.5 hour days to 10.5 hour days also so I would get more full days off. Nothing has made me less miserable yet. I think working 10.5 hour days actually made me more miserable because I have even less time in the day and the three days off is only nice when I have them all stacked in a row. However, I spend all that time dreading the last day off and trying to recover from my long work week. The job itself isn't bad. It can be busy at times, but my coworkers are great. Some days I literally just sit around and do almost nothing all day and sometimes I even leave significantly early enough while still getting paid. I only make $16 an hour but the job is extremely temporary until I manage to get into grad school. However, I dread of resuming 40 hour weeks after grad school. I dread of not having enough money to take care of my kids or take care of myself when I get older if I don't grind on a 40 hour work week now and waste my youth on working. I'm also afraid that all this grinding wouldn't even pay off in the end (read The End Game by Corey Abramson). I'm afraid of the alienation that comes with working 40 hours a week. I barely see my old friends now and we're drifting apart. 

Is there any way out that doesn't involve exploiting other people? Is there any way I can just work 20 hours a week and not worry about the future? I want community and I want time to experience the world and I want to be comfortable and healthy and have access to basic resources such as decent healthcare in my old age.

804,Do you ever take time to think about how capitalism forces people to ''augment'' their bodies beyond their natural limitations to excel in pointless jobs?,"The title may be a little confusing so let me try and explain the topic here.

Recently I started thinking about how we as a society are dependent on various remedies to help us get through the physical and mental stress of our daily lives and how most of that physical and mental stress is caused by capitalist bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

* Are your feet hurting because you had to stand for 12 hours straight? Just get some inserts 
* Are you slow at work because you can't get a good nights sleep due to constant work and the unaffordability of quality bedding products? Just get yourself an energy drink or use one of the many drugs that promise to give you energy!
* Are you suffering from depression that is caused by your work? get anti-depressants! 
* Is your back hurting from the physical stress of work? get a back brace!

&amp;#x200B;

I find that most people seem to be ok with all of this, these remedies or ''augmentations'' to the human body tend to be accepted as a good and natural part of life but to me they don't feel good or natural.

To me, human work ethic should be based around the personal limitations of every individual. People should work according to their physical and mental health. If you are in pain of any sort, you should rest rather than push through it for the sake of the company.

Not enough managers, alot of favouritism within the workplace, bullying, sexual harrasment you name it and it occured within the workplace.

I lost my sister who is my only sibling to back in 2020 and i was in no state to work at all, i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and i really thought about leaving as that job only made my mental health worse but decided to continue as long as i could.

It was no longer than two weeks since my sister passed that we were forced to take our laptops home and take part in a quiz identifying areas to which we could make the sales process smoother (i still dont understand how this could be identified as a quiz as it was more of a lecture), i told my boss i can't take part as everytime i left work and got home i was supporting my parents as much as i could i had alot of family members visiting on a daily basis and it just wasn't ideal, this quiz was outside of my contracted working hours and my boss told me we wouldn't be getting paid for said quiz but it was mandatory.

Long story short, i take part and break down halfway through it as my family were in the next room talking about memories with my sister, we were all on zoom so everyone could see i was visibly struggling so i close my laptop and immediately get a text from my boss telling me if i don't log back in i shall receive a warning tomorrow when heading into work, i had to sit there for nearly 5 hours as it started at 6pm till 11pm literally losing my mind.

I quit some weeks later but i reported the matter to HR with alot of my colleagues backing me up surprisingly i had the majority of the office submit a complaint only for HR to say they won't act on it as the reports they received were 70% positive which was not true.

I'm still mentally scarred from this incident as i am a very closed person and i had to show emotion to people who i didn't feel comfortable with, it traumatised me i still get upset thinking about it to this day.",False,nkovxx,Better-Freedom9629,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nkovxx/ceo_made_us_work_past_our_contracted_hours_from/,13,1

Holy shit has the reaction been hilarious. Suddenly they're all walking on eggshells, asking me what I want; ""Is it more money? More responsibility?"", what could they offer me, what would I like the role to shape into.

There were contracts lost and I got dumped into a call center department taking complaints from customers for 12 hours a day a little over a year ago.  Except they aren’t normal situations, like I have to be licensed in every state of the country and pay a fee ranging from 50-250 every two years per state (I think maybe 12 don’t require a fee).  

They tell us that we are temporary and can be replaced anytime.  They tell us the insured is always right to be upset and scream at us and that we should politely deal with it because they are going through a rough time.  Well my entire life’s made into a “rough time” because people call all day constantly acting like children and I’m the bucket they call to shovel their shit into.
And there’s no way to negotiate reduced hours or changing departments with them.  Their attitude is basically if you can’t handle it you shouldn’t do catastrophe work and we will find someone who acts happy.  My coworkers are either just as fed up as I am and afraid to speak up or creepy and brainwashed.

815,"Do any of you reach a breaking point with your job, and start self-sabotaging and getting really bad at your work because you feel completely defeated and let down?","My breaking point was in February, and I've been job hunting since then, but the market is really hard and my schedule has made it really difficult to make interviews or even just make it on time. I work ridiculously long night shifts and can barely function in the day time for the few interviews I've been asked to do. I was late to one, missed another, and could barely stay awake for a third, all due to not being functional and also severely stressed/depressed. My workplace is incredibly toxic for the main reasons we talk about on here, but also I'm in a marginalized group that is often targeted, and my hr is a joke.

I am a very sensitive person, when I try to tough it up emotionally, my distress shows up in my chronic health conditions. I've had to call out many times because I get so sick from chronic illness triggered by the harsh hours combined with the workplace bullying. 

Annnnd.... I'm not proud of this, but I now drag my feet when heading to work (because it takes me extra long to fight myself to leave the house every day) and I'm often late. I also have adhd and time blindness is a biatch that intensifies when there's anxiety involved. I've tried getting help for it but my doctor's don't believe me and prescribe me medication that doesn't work, or they won't prescribe anything at all. My boss recently asked me what's going on, but how can I be honest? He doesn't give a fuck about me, the higher-ups are always late and pass their work down to people who aren't trained or qualified, including him. Not to mention if I say I'm being targeted, it will absolutely go on deaf ears.

I live in a right wing state in the us that is not protected by unions, I really have nowhere to go to fight this. I overheard that people are talking about firing me. I'm relieved and angered and scared. I keep trying to tell myself this isn't entirely my fault and I'm being broken down, but the capitalist, boomer mentality my father pounded in my brain keeps telling me I'm a piece of shit.

Working for Good's is fairly easy as long as you ""Work Hard, He Vice"". His is our motto!

I've seen every kind of human being in my 40 years in business. | pretty much know within an
hour what kind of employee or if an employee someone is going to be. Most interview very well
and it turns out well. Some interview well and it turns out not so well.

I've heard every excuse for not being able to perform here. Very excuse begins with ""can't""
which translated to ""I don't want to"". ha! An you imagine saying to your boss, after you've
read and claimed to have understood what is required of you, that you can't do it? Why | would
have died before saying that! ha!

He've had the know it all, the complained, whiter, lazy, manipulation, readers, riders, absent
or late, liar, waters, clock watches, willful, controller, passive aggressor, poker (I'll explain in
a moment) and worst of all combined, the splinters.

Splitting is a behavior of girls, young mostly but not always. Usually taught by their mothers.
His is the person who talks about others in an attempt to split people apart and feel better
about themselves. You know, ""so and so said this about you and | couldn't believe it! so and so
is so stuck up that she thinks she's better than us"". And so it goes. His my friends, is poison in
action. These disguised gas have no end game. It's just spreading and stirring all the while
believing they are innocent. It's such a common thing among girls. His is where toxicity and
drama find their roots.

I'll admit, it's hard to deal with. They are very good at what they do. Any times they are good
workers which is even more frustration. | can also say with certainty, there is no cure. I've tried
over the years but they can't fix what they don't believe to be true. They deny it 100% of the
time. They call it ""helping"".

Boys seldom practice this. They just duke it out! ha!

Of a splitter can recruit, which is one of her tools, she feels vindicated. Of she can't find
someone to join her she will leave.

Rulers are those we know, and just like splinters, we all know one, who approach you daily,
dump their stuff on you and then go about their business. All they want to do is complain
about their stuff to someone who will listen so they can feel normal. They walk away and each
time you are left holding this bag of pure. They feel great and you feel, well... like you've been
asked on! They are exhausting.

Some of these behavior we can manage. Most we can't. Since we demand friendliness,
courteousness, hard work and more, bad behavior pop up quickly. It's the worst part of
employing folks.

Of they make it so far as it reaches me, | free up their future. Most of the time our culture will
drum them out. Of they can't find reception of their poor behavior they move on.

In the other side of this are the wonderful people we have in our employ. Everyone works
hard. Everyone is friendly. They either brought the tools with them or learned our way of doing
things. When they hit on what we do, it's a very rewarding thing to see. It's the most joyful
experience | have here.

Of you enjoy being your best, Good's is for you!

I'm new to this sub but glad to be here. I went on furlough last May, was full laid off in October and have just now gone back to a new job. I'm in the second week and already having panic attacks every night. I spent a whole year being awake until I was tired, sleeping until I was rested, and loving according to my own rhythms. Trying to adjust back to their clock and being held accountable to someone else's idea of productivity has me seriously depressed. 

I keep thinking of that quote from Office Space, ""yesterday I did absolutely nothing and it was everything I thought it could be."" 

I just don't know how I'm going get back to the grind. I keep thinking of how I did it all those years, and all I can remember is trying to constantly outrun the impending doom if I don't continue to earn money. I also remember I would spend a lot of time daydreaming about a life without work.

865,Lost in WFH limbo,"We've been WFH for the past year (I work in software development), and I have managed to mostly ""blend into the background"" at work. I didn't aim for it to happen, and now I am not sure what to do.

I don't have a manger who checks in as I am an experienced employee. 

I was rather depressed at the start of the pandemic. and very gradually I was doing less and less work myself, also we hired quite a few people over the year, I trained and passed over most responsibilities, I started saying I wasn't needed any more in various areas as these new people were picking it up, so I left the channels and recurring meetings. This carried on until I got to this point.  
Now I go to some meetings a couple times a week and chime in my options on things, check my emails and make sure to only respond to things addressed directly to me and only if I think they will follow up on it.   
Now that it's happened, I can't stop. Whenever somebody (rarely) asks me directly for something, I explain that I am busy so it may take some time to get round to it. I set my status to ""in meetings"" or ""busy"".   
I assume people must think I am busy, or they don't know what I do, or simply don't care.  
You may think this sounds like a dream scenario but:  
1. I can't relax while it's work hours because I stress about people suddenly being like ""where is X?, what's he doing?"" so I regularly check communications.  
2. I feel a general lack of purpose and motivation because it seems my job was in fact pointless, because nobody even notices when I am not doing anything, and nobody seems to care, so why should I? I even managed to secure a raise during this period. It baffles me.   


What I am looking for I guess is opinions on the following:

1. What would you do in my situation? 
2. How would you not worry about this situation enough to enjoy it?
3. Would you look to change jobs or ride it out as long as possible? Nobody has had anything bad to say so far...

However I still stay at my desk throughout the day, but not doing anything meaningful, because I still am there ""just in case"". So I am looking for something meaningful that I can do instead of just browsing reddit at work. 

I assume in the long run this could only really blow up in my face if somebody really delved into what I have been doing all year, or on the other hand I'll become even more invisible and maybe become one of those crazy stories of people on payroll that people forget exist.

It's like I don't know I know stuff or can't recall it, kind of like how a file or storage medium gets corrupted on a computer you can't do anything with  it.

Wake up many times not rested or just straight up more tired than the night before. Too often dread going in, often enough that I notice that I end up crying before work (one week it was numerous days in a row at various times o the morning). Spend seven and a half hours on my feet having had hardly enough time for a breakfast,  in a mix of tired, stressed anxiety. I even fantasise about quitting (that notice has been written for over a year now) or being rendered unable to work. Then there's the exhaustion that comes on way too quickly after the day is over. I feel forever one step behind the game (I do have the least experience in the field there).

There's more to this which I'm not even sure I should write or how to write it down. Feel I want to leave, but also feeling stuck and like things are going to get harder in a few weeks. The people I work with are happy there and seem to 'just know' what's going/what to do whereas I know what I'm doing but that's only 1% of what I'm expected to do/know so I end up thinking I've done my task wrong anyway.

It gives me anxiety because I think that at any moment someone's actually going to realize that nothing would change if I were not here and they could save themselves the money.

It also trashes my confidence. If I'm not constantly being met by challenges that I am overcoming, how do I know that I'm capable? Maybe all my ability to do good work has atrophied. Maybe I don't know anything useful. I wanted to be able to handle bigger and more complex projects, but now I handle nothing. If I don't exercise those skills, I'll lose them.

It also makes me afraid that other people in the office think that the problem is me; that I'm choosing to slack off or I'm choosing to be useless, when nothing about this is my choice, and all my attempts to make myself more useful or give myself more work are met with rejection and not a small amount of derision for attempting to rock the boat and challenge my boss's authority.

I have never been paid so much to do so little, and I know I'm not earning it. I know my coworkers with other job titles do significantly more work. I might even get paid more than them! How bullshit would *that* be? Id' be lucky if they didn't hate me on that basis alone.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Being a Pro**

Next up was a real career move. I got hired at a major professional services company. I figured that maybe in this place they'll have me do all the buzzword stuff that I learned to do in college and which you hear a lot about in corporate fluff and jargon. Now it was time to apply complicated code and higher mathematics and anything you could dream of and I'd make a name for myself and reap the rewards.

After all, that's what I sold myself with in the job interview.

What follows is a true account of my experience in a major professional services firm that charges ridiculous fees from clients in order to ""unlock"" all kinds of value.

I was placed into a function that was to provide an IT service for a client. When I got in, the system that was in place was such that a manager was taking requirements from a client, but because that manager was a foreigner (one of the countries where basically all IT gets outsourced), he couldn't read the requirements because the client was promised service in their native language, even though all parties involved in this service on both ours and the client side spoke English.

So since the requirements were delivered in a language he didn't understand, he had to forward the requirements to a translation service that was located in yet another country. This translation service had no technical knowledge, so obviously all technical terms weren't translated very well. Add to that, the translated document was incredibly messy and basically every word in the original language was followed by an English translation of that word in a different font color.

Few people can say they've read a document where every other word is in English and every other word is in another language. I've read these and was paid to read them.

So this manager got his translated document and sent it to a team of  software developers in his native country, who obviously had no clue what they were supposed to do because these requirements were not only in a messy document, they were translated in a confusing manner. The  developers couldn't get to work because first they had to come up with an estimate of how long it'll take to do the job. Often this process took longer than the actual job and was also included in the estimate, so even if the client didn't approve of the work estimate, the client  was charged for just being provided with the estimate.

The client was obviously unhappy with this situation and the professional services company's management was tired of the complaints, so they made the only decision they could come up with:  
This was obviously a resource issue and the solution to resource issues is to allocate more resources to it.

So they threw me at the problem. Now, you might think, as I did, that since I could do some programming and spoke both English and the client's preferred language, and since I had previous experience from dealing with requirements, that it would only make sense we just have me take the  requirements, do the necessary coding and that'd be it. No need to throw all these people at the problem.

If you'd think that, you'd be wrong. The client wanted to interface with someone who could speak the language, but everything else had to be in English because the developers and their manager only spoke English.

So instead of the client sending the requirements document in English, they continued to send it in their language. Now, you might think that since I had the necessary technical expertise, I could then translate the  document.

Again, you'd be wrong. My job was to forward this document to the translation service. When I asked why I couldn't just translate the document myself, I was told I'm too busy.

Now, because my job was obviously not managerial in nature and the developers had their own manager, I obviously needed a manager of my own. So the setup was 7 people allocated to this process that I could have done on my own in a fraction of the time and frustration that everyone was subjected to. Two of those seven people were managers, 4 were  software developers and then there was me who, again, could do the entire thing on my own if I were allowed to.

Now, this overly complicated process was allowed to continue, and the managers wound up only making powerpoint presentations about who's fault  it is that everything is a mess. They never blamed me, I mean, they were good managers in that sense, but I found it really strange anyway. 

So the managers spent all day every day writing up powerpoint slides of recorded phone call transcripts to shift the blame from us to the client. 

Premium customer service right there. 

It's also sort of funny that typing up phone call transcripts into a powerpoint with the singular purpose of blaming the client for everything that went wrong was also work that was charged to the client.

I also need to point out that the service we were providing was incredibly mundane in nature. It wasn't critical at all and often served no real purpose. The most interesting tasks that came up in it were  deemed too complex, meaning the work estimates were insane and so the client  declined to have them done, citing that it's too expensive.

I couldn't help but agree.

I still had no idea what my job really was, I didn't really do anything  besides forward emails. I even stopped answering calls at one point and asked everyone to submit their requests in writing for ""auditability"". I often disappeared for days because I went out to party and binge drink. No one noticed my absence.

I didn't stick around for too long because this wasn't a healthy place  for me. Every time I had a suggestion about how stupid the whole setup is, I was told I was too busy to think about things like that and that I should get back to work, whatever that was supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------------------

**Foot in the Door**

When I was about 18 or 19 and wasn't enrolled in college yet, I was forced to go looking for a job. I remember walking into an interview at a temp agency since I was what people would call ""unskilled"".  I figured the interview would just be a formality, but it really wasn't. Apparently getting a job at a warehouse lifting boxes would really require a thorough vetting of my interests and career aspirations. 

So I walk into the temp agency office, and I was greeted by two twenty-something pantsuit-wearing HR aces and asked to step into a tiny room. I hadn't really been in a job interview before, nor was I prepared for one now, so obviously I had no idea what to expect. So I sat down in an armchair that was so deep my feet almost dangled in the air, but I maintained my composure in what seemed at the time like a highly skewed power dynamic. 

&amp;#x200B;

""What is your name?""

\-(Sir Galahad)

""What is your favourite color?""

\-(Blue, no wait!)

&amp;#x200B;

After apparently making sure I was indeed a teenager looking for a job at a warehouse, a position they themselves had posted online, they started asking me questions that to this day seem rather odd. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Why do you want to work at this warehouse we're staffing for?""

\- Because I need the job? Well, that was my first reaction, but I thought that that would be too crass, these people are smart and they probably want to hear a smart answer:

\-""Well I'm looking for an opportunity to apply myself, I think I would be a perfect match for this warehouse!""

I nailed it, that must have been what they were looking for, although I really felt like an idiot. All I need is a job to keep me occupied for the next couple of months and then I can go to college. They had to have known this, so why were we pretending this was anything else? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?""

My world stopped for a minute instant as a part of my soul died. 

\-""Well probably at that fucking warehouse, then?""

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't land the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, temp agencies are a dime a dozen, so eventually I found one that staffed people to all kinds of call centers and office mailrooms and front desks. That's what I did for a while, answered phones and sat at the front desk of various offices. It wasn't very hard, but apparently a lot of these companies thought I did a good job of it, although I have no idea how you could measure performance in relation to someone else in a job like that.

Now, these were oddjobs for the most part, but eventually I got a step up to do data entry, which was a 30% salary bump compared to the mailroom, and I felt like I'd won the fucking lottery.

Data entry was just that, I was handed a piece of paper with product codes and names on it, and my job was to type them on a computer. That's it. It's not hard to get it right once you develop some muscle memory on the numpad, so I was really good at it. 

So one time I was handed a piece of paper that would get printed out as a bill of lading or something like that. The problem with this was that the data to be entered was too long to fit into the fields the software could handle, so I had to truncate or abbreviate the data. I was told not to, that it wasn't allowed, but obviously, how else could it possibly be done? 

So I did it anyway and it didn't matter one bit. 

Now, while working in data entry (of which I was very proud, since none of my friends had a ""cushy"" office job), I would often run out of things to do. So naturally I found my boss and asked her if they had something for me to do because I was done with my work. Sometimes she had an incredulous look on her face, ""could it be possible it's done that fast?"" So naturally I was asked to redo the work since I must have made a mistake if it was over so soon. I redid everything and about 20 minutes later I found my boss again and said I've now done this mundane task twice. But since they'd hired me for the day, I was told I could ask around the office if anyone else had something for me to do. 

I was very proud of course to be so efficient that now I could learn about other things that go on in the office, but it was very rare that anyone ever had anything for me, and my asking around was considered something of a nuisance since I would interrupt them while they were doing all kinds of important things.

As much as it sounds like a caricature at this point, I was once asked to do ""some filing"". Yes, there is always ""filing"" to do, even if everything is already filed - you can always redo the filing. So I did, and when that was done, I had absolutely nothing to do. Sometimes I would redo some data entry I had already done because otherwise I'd just have to wait out the clock. I had indeed sold my time so they can do with me what they like, even if it is just sit around and wait to go home. 

So this job was, about 30% bullshit. Now that I write this, I see why it paid 30% better than what I had previously made.

891,Surprised by what I found in this sub,"I guess I didn’t dig deep enough through the archives, but from the bio I was expecting some kind of revolutionary insight into escaping the rate race. Instead, all I see are memes (most of them I like) and just constant streams of people bitching about their jobs, even before they have started them in some cases.

That is probably to be expected given the name of the sub, but I feel like I was made to expect some positivity and guiding light. I’ve watched a couple of the videos from the links supplied and enjoyed them, but the sub itself is not so inspiring or revolutionary. 

I agree that big business is corrupt and workers should be paid more, and have better conditions, and everything else that the rest of the people here want, but I’m prepared to put my mind to trying to make things better for myself rather than just complaining and expecting everything to fix itself. 

I’m a proponent of FIRE and believe wholeheartedly in the principles of gaining your independence from employment and being the master of your own destiny. Now, there’s more ways to skin that cat than just FIRE, and that’s what I had hoped to learn here. 

Downvote me, and throw insults if it makes you feel better, but unfortunately the only person who is gonna be able to make a difference is you. It’s probably not gonna matter who you vote for, or how much you protest.

912,What entry level jobs have little social interactions &amp; pressure for disabled?,"Male &amp; 24 yr old, lives -Worcester MA.

I have schizophrenia related illness.

After I graduated college I started new job. Near the end of employment with company, i lost my mind, I started hallucinating near end of 2019. Went crazy, Gave up job at place. Was too dysfunctional. 

Stopped working. tried working again twice, another job in 2019 and 2021, all lasted a week before I got fired. I would get psychotic, scared and run away from job site because I would start to panic and think I was going to die, shadow people were out to get me. Imaginary People would pop in and out of existence near me and disrupt my productivity, objects and things would move from the corner of my eyes and scare the hell out of me.

I am still psychotic like this today. Disconnect with reality daily. 

Medication has not helped, turned me into a zombie. Will not take anymore and do not want to be a guinea pig by trying new pills.

After I stopped working, I applied for disability services. I live off $300 cash assistance per month plus food stamps &amp; rent controlled housing now. This all took a couple years to get while living homeless, I lived outside and ate dumpster food before I got this help.

 I'm waiting for SSI/disability approval to get at most $800 per month.

Now I get to be welfare dependent and hated by half my country for living off assistance. What the fuck happened to my life man, it was fucked from the beginning. 

I feel like a piece of shit now I'm not ""pulling myself up by my boot straps"" (all Republicans probably jack off to when they hear that phrase) and just have a respectable living. 

At the end I'm exploited either way. So I'm going to take what I can get and fuck off.

The other jobs never interested me. I always aimed way too law and only applied to be a jurist about two to ten times. I was always rejected due to a lack of experience.

So I've been doing all kinds of stuff far below my level and became cynical because it was law school that made me like this in the first place: tired, heartbroken, demotivated, broken.

Anyway. Whenever I mention that I want a job that is actually just 8 hours a day I'm dismissed by a family member as ""all jobs are like the one you have now"". 

And I REFUSE to accept that. If I have to I will change jobs frequently then. But I won't tolerate this overworking situation and I only do that now bc this is my first job and bc of the fucking virus. And I'm already on job hunt again so this is temporary. 

But you know I only need a bit of white lie??? I literally get on the verge of a mental breakdown when I'm dismissed in this matter. Like just say ""yeah you will find one like that"". And I will go on my day without wanting to kill myself.

934,I never thought merchandising would be easy but I didn't think it was this hard either....,"I started merchandising for Pepsi back in December and....it was ok for the most part. I was part time up until about March, I believe, then I got full time. Honestly, I just don't want to be a merchandiser anymore....it sucks.

I genuinely didn't mind the physical aspect of it, but when you're busting your ass just to keep yourself on time for the next store, day by day, week by week, it starts taking a toll on you. I thought it'd be nice way to keep active; I've suffered from being overweight my whole life and that's caused severe depression and anxiety in me and I feel like this job is just making it worse.

Every store I've worked, I've seen Coke, 7-up and Frito Lay with multiple people servicing the 2 big stores in our schedules: Walmart and Krogers. I've also seen multiple merchandisers for said companies servicing smaller, easier stores. But for some reason at Pepsi, we're on our own and when I was in training, I was taught to NOT be the guy asking for help all the time, as if having help is some for of taboo. And yet, as a part time, I was bouncing around various stores and would occasionally help out a full timer maybe once a week and the stores would look nicer and be done quicker because of it. I just don't understand why we can't have at least 2 people per route.

&amp;#x200B;

My start time is 5:30. I had a Walmart first and the load didn't get there until 8:30. I asked for help to keep myself on schedule and there was literally nobody available to help until 1:00 pm at best. So I busted out 7 pallets by 12:00 pm, essentially sprinting and burning myself out before my other stores, and even by then, I still had several carts of front cooler/single serve items that could've gone out but I ended up doing the bare minimum and leaving because I NEEDED to get to my next store to work the load. And not that it was his fault because he had his own loads to deal with but my help didn't really get there until 2:30 when I was almost done with the 2nd store and from then on we did the last 2 together which went quickly because we were together. But I didn't get home until 4:30 that day. And that's slowly becoming a normal thing now. 

Meanwhile, on my days off, when I make time to get groceries, I'll see multiple sales reps across the stores working it all together. I just hate this no help attitude for the merchandisers. You can work 7-12 pallets on your own and leave one case or forget one little shelf space or one little cooler and the sales reps will make you feel like the worst person because of it.

I don't think I can handle it anymore. The pay and the benefits don't even feel worth it because of this stress I'm feeling but what else am I going to do? I kind of trapped myself, thinking this would be a simple enough job to just stock shelves but there's just a crap ton of obstacles that will get in your way in the process and its not an enjoyable experience. I've spent my whole life trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest of it but I genuinely don't know.",False,nj7nii,GiantMenacingKrab,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nj7nii/i_never_thought_merchandising_would_be_easy_but_i/,10,1

941,What pushed you into an antiwork stance?,"My story of how my mindset changed is kinda long. Like most of us I was conditioned from q young age into thinking I wanted a dream career and all that. When I was in college I started to have my doubts after watching friends graduate with good degrees and still work minimum wage jobs while swallowed by debt. But I didn't fully switch until I experienced the worse year and a half of my life. 

I had 3 family members pass all within a year and a half of eachother. The first in December of 2018. I never got to say goodbye. I saw her after the fact and I was just devastated. As I held her cold hand, It struck me then that I had missed out on my only opportunity to say goodbye....because I'd been at work for a job that didn't care about me. 

I told them I would need her funeral off, they told me I would work when they needed me and they couldn't give me the day off, and I told them I quit. I wasn't going to let them take this from me also. I ended up having a breakdown a month after this, and dropped out of my second year of college and moved home with my parents.

I didn't even really have time to recover before the next death occurred in December 2019. By then I had another minimum wage job. I called out the day it happened, and instead of being told, ""oh I'm sorry, of course, take this time."" I was told, ""are you sure you can't come in? If the person has already passed, what good will you do for them now?"" I was in shock and ignored this, as it seemed like the least of my problems at the time as my world crashed down around me for the second time in one year. 

The third death occurred in April of 2020. I called work sobbing telling them I couldn't come in as I was on my way to the hospital to say goodbye. I received major attitude on the other line and was actually hung up on. 

I received the worst treatment of my life while I was at my most vulnerable from these managers. It rocked my worldview and other than the shit wages, totally pushed me into being antiwork. The shit treatment, unsafe conditions, and poor pay of working on the front lines during the thick of the Covid outbreak only set my stance in stone. 

So, if you've made it this far, thank you. And I would love to hear your own stories of what pushed you into the antiwork mindset as well.",False,nja0di,Freebird9804,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nja0di/what_pushed_you_into_an_antiwork_stance/,45,1
942,Called off work today because I just can't fucking stand working at Target anymore,"I will either get fired real soon or quit. One or the other. I just don't want to have to give notice first. I probably won't. I'll just leave it off of my resume, and I see no problem with that. I've only worked there for about a month anyway. 

The job starts at 4AM and I just can't do it anymore. My boss is a fucking c*nt and I work with far right Qanon followers. Sure there's some nice people there but they can't distract from how overall shitty the experience is. It's backbreaking work and I don't like working for overly mean people. Plus mask mandates are optional there now. 

Maybe I can get back to working from home. Every job I applied for in that field required a drug test and since I now have my medical weed card I may be able to get by with a drug test. Maybe I'll even try going back to school this fall where I plan to touch up my Adobe Audition skills (or lack thereof).

The only option I see is us banding together and withholding money where we can. As someone recently posted, it's time to keep expenses to food, water, and bare minimum shelter. The needs, not the wants.

Instead of selling my soul and health I'm going hard on self-imposed austerity. For all my bitching and moaning I still managed to let unconscious consumerism steal my meager wages. No more. I'm 3 weeks into paying only for food and gas, and I stretch those as far as I can. It's my vices that numb me to this god awful system that are the hardest to give up, but so far I'm cruising at 25% of my regular imbibing. 

If we all do this it will out pressure on the system.

Same with social media that uses us to practice mind control (aka algorithms). They profit off of false information and divison when we need unity. HOW DARE THEY?! I havent used facebook since 2010 and dont understand why anyone does, but whatever the attraction to it please, PLEASE try to disentangle from it. I want Zuckerberg to crawl and beg, and the only way to get that is to leave the platform.

 We dont have a lot of options. It sucks to be struggling, to barely be getting by, and still be asked to shoulder the burden of change. It's also hard to be asked to give up spending, when you're already spending so, so little.

But that's our situation folks. If you have another way to use the power of individual action multipled over the masses to put pressure on the system, I'd love to hear it.",False,nk4bh6,dogwoodcuntseed,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nk4bh6/let_us_unite_and_boycott/,8,1

956,What's the plan?,"I, like many other subredditors, am tired of the incessant tyrannical expectations put upon the modern worker. I could go on for days about the injustices I experience in my place of employment. I want to democratize the workplace. I want technology to absorb the bulk of our efforts. I want to feel valued as a human being instead of being valued for what I can contribute to a corporation.

That said, I feel stuck and overwhelmed over what the anti-work community's next move should be. I sympathize with almost every post here, but I see far more griping than I see action plans. I don't have a plan myself, but I'm desperate to come across some insight that might propel our sentiments into actual change.

Does anybody have or belong to a group or network that could be useful to someone who wants to actively participate in the destruction of today's wage slavery? I need to actually DO something about these injustices! I work in the southeastern US, where unions are practically unheard of and adamantly ridiculed when they are discussed. I've had the same job for more than five years. No pay increase. No sick days. Never got more than 80 hours vacation per year. No air conditioning despite the 100 degree, high humidity summers. I could bash my employer and the entire job market for days, but I need something more tangible to lean on.

What is someone like myself to do in this situation? Are there any groups that you're aware of that are seeking to bring about real change in the workplace? Who might I get in touch with to get the ball rolling? I have thought about starting a union at my current place of employment, but I worry about the repercussions. That, coupled with the fact that nobody around here even knows the first thing about what a union IS, are highly deincentivising prospects. Any feedback would be appreciated.

980,Tips on asking for additional PTO for someone fresh out of college?,"First time posting, long time lurker.

For the past year I have been working an office job part time while I finished up college. I graduated, and soon I will be sitting down with HR to discuss salary and benefits package. I am quite excited, as this job treats me well and i enjoy it far more than my previous jobs in the fast food industry. They like me and are very interested in hiring me. However, I am nervous about receiving a small amount of PTO, as I am a fresh grad with little work experience in this field. I live in America, if you haven’t guessed lol.

My questions are:

-Is it appropriate for someone with my level of work experience to negotiate additional PTO?
-Do you have any tips on actually doing this?
-I know every company/industry is different, but are they likely to budge?

I am scared to death about getting a lousy amount of PTO and turning into some drained office worker looking forward to those meager 4 or 5 days off for the entire year.

1001,I’m a Health Care Worker who burned out during the pandemic.,"I’m not sure where else to post this essay, and I’m not even sure *why* I’m posting it. I guess r/antiwork seems like the kind of place where my frustration and disillusionment will be understood. And if it doesn’t resonate with you, that’s okay. It still feels good to get it off my chest.
     

      I’m a Support Worker, and I worked for a well-known organization that helps people with a range of disabilities. I loved my job. I made strong connections with the people I supported, got along wonderfully with my coworkers, and felt respected and valued by my supervisor. It was the first job I had that didn’t feel like *work*. I never had to drag myself to the office, or motivate myself like in some other jobs. The deep sense of meaning I derived from supporting people helped fuel me through the pandemic for more than a year. While many others were at home - understandably avoiding the virus and doing their part to minimize the spread - my coworkers and I were sweating through our masks and gambling with our health for the greater good of the residents we often grew to love. We left our homes and entered a community that harboured an invisible virus, and many of us did it for less than $600 a week. 
      But as much as we deserved better pay, it was never about the money. I was driven by the people who appreciated me, and the powerful connections made by stepping into the lives of people in true need. But nothing can polish the fact that the life of a PSW is haunted by part time and casual positions; full-time hours are rare and coveted roles, often going to those who have seniority. Companies and organizations keep costs low by creating only a small handful of 40 hour work weeks, and the rest are forced to work two jobs, or scramble to snatch any crumbs that might fall off the table when someone calls in sick. It sometimes felt demeaning - I can’t deny it. You can work for *years* and still only be handed 25 - 30 hours a week. And the pay? Nothing to write home about. The job involves monitoring the health of vulnerable people with sometimes complex medical conditions, and can require quick thinking and sound judgement to save the life of someone in medical crisis. And yet I was paid only $18 an hour to sometimes be the only guardian of more than 10 souls...some in wheelchairs, some unable to see or easily communicate their needs. $18 to be willing and able to respond to what can sometimes seem like a galaxy of demands. $18 to potentially save a life. But I did it. *We* did it. Everyday thousands of PSW’s just like us are making similar sacrifices and are being rewarded with crummy pay and barely enough hours to survive. I’m a 41 year old man, and my dad helps me with RENT because the organization I work for doesn’t provide a living wage. And I still showed up, until eventually the grind and sacrifice, the poor wages and measly hours, they began to pollute my appreciation for the job. They tainted my desire to come to work each morning. The notion that I was making these sacrifices for an organization that wouldn’t give me livable pay and hours began to erode my sense of belonging and soon my motivation suffered, too. The job no longer enticed me in a way that made a day that starts at 5am tolerable. I needed more sleep, cared less about myself and my life in general, and felt like I was sleepwalking through my days off because I was too preoccupied with the next strenuous shift to really enjoy my free time. 
      And throughout this questionable journey, I was continuously receiving tone-deaf emails from head office reminding me of the importance of self-care. I was told to sleep well, exercise, and meditate to help off-set the horrible pay and part time hours I was being handed by the authors of these emails. They had the nerve to preach the prudence of mindfulness and sleep-hygiene to the same people whose mental health their policies and treatment were actively destroying. The irony sometimes sickened me. It all became too much one day, and after a particularly nasty and abusive experience at the hands of a new resident, I called my supervisor and calmly told her that she needed to come in and cover for me because I was done. I had enough. Being kind and thoughtful, she discouraged me from officially quitting and asked me to take some time off to catch my breath. I agreed, and went home to lick my wounds. After a few days of rest I felt more focused, stronger, ready to possibly come back to work in a diminished role - ideally with less hours so I could ease myself back into work, and emerge successfully from my burn-out. Front office even reached out to me, requesting that I detail the incident in writing and explain why I left the way I did. This person also expressed concern for my mental well-being, which was the first time anyone had personally addressed the importance of my state of mind. I was hopeful. For a moment I felt protected and valued by my employer. But that didn’t last. 
      After writing an email explaining what happened, and why I left after being verbally abused, I received a call from someone at HR who explained she wanted to hear “my side of things”. I talked at length about the stress, the low pay, the bad hours, and how being bullied by a resident just added more weight to a structure that was already overloaded. She feigned sympathy. She thanked me for my honesty, and promised to call me the next day to discuss my possible and gradual return to work. The next day my phone never rang. By 5:30 that night my instinct told me the call was never coming, so I checked my email and there it was: they informed me I was no longer welcome at the office, and that they wished me good luck in my future. After all their song and dance about the importance of mental health, all the patronizing seminars and workshops they encouraged me to participate in, after all my sacrifice despite poor pay and rotten hours, they just tossed me aside when I finally burned out. And they weren’t even decent enough to do it over the phone; I had to read it in email. 
      I learned a painful and bitter lesson that when push comes to shove, they don’t care about me. Since then I’ve strongly considered leaving the field, and finding a job with more pay and less sacrifice. I want to find an employer who proves they value me through real action and reward, instead of coaching me with hallow emails that lie about how concerned and focused they are on the well-being of their staff. I haven’t decided yet if I’ll leave my career behind, but if I do it will be a bitter break-up.  I will always feel the loss of the connection to those that support work bonded me to. Care-workers deserve real pay, full time hours, and the true respect and support of head office. Anything less forces even the best workers to seek better employment elsewhere. Simple as that.

1004,Here's my antiwork plan,"I agree with the antiwork movement. I hate working too but we still have bills to pay.

So I've been trying to get my bills lower so I don't have to work as much. All my bills right now are about 900 US. That includes a 336 dollar mortgage payment and a 262 dollar car payment. I live in rural NC. After 5 years my car will be paid off and my bills will drop to about 600. After the house is paid off, it'll drop to less than 300. Some of that 300 is food, water, and electricity—all things I can reduce. I thought about growing my own food and selling what I can't eat, collecting rainwater for bathing and drinking, getting solar panels, etc. My electric bill last month was 37 dollars so I wouldn't need a big system.

If I can grow enough food, I might be able to sell the surplus and make enough to cover my expenses. Or save up enough where I can make most of that in interest. Then I could give the idea of having to work the middle finger. In the worse case, I'd have to work but getting 300 a month would be pretty damn easy. If 15/hr becomes the law, I could work anywhere and make enough to cover my monthly bills every 2.5 days. There's 260 business days in a year so after just 1 year, I'd have 104 months (8.66 years) worth of savings (not including taxes).

I’m 25.. I currently live with my Mom, her boyfriend and older brother and little sister. 

Me and my 27 yr old brother share a room and I have to deal with the fact that he’s a heroine addict and doesn’t plan on seeking any help to get better. So I have to endure seeing him high as shit on a regular basis .. and it’s not a pretty sight. 

I’ve been working full-time in a Cafeteria at a public school for the past year now and although it’s probably one of the easiest jobs I’ve had.. I’m starting to get that brain numbing feeling of worthlessness again. 

I had plans to work a second job at an Amazon facility I had just landed two weeks ago. but the night of my first shift, 6hrs in I got a call that my girlfriend had died. I completely lost all interest in going back to that place afterwards because we were supposed to be working there together. I never really wanted to work there it was her idea at first. 

So now I’m back at the Cafeteria and even it’s starting to get the best of me. They sent me to another school because a majority of the staff in the entire district has quit or been laid-off because of the impact of the pandemic.
 
It is now Monday and didn’t report to work today because I’m severely depressed about the death of my significant other.

1015,Don’t normalize Life = Work,"For the past year I have been unemployed due to no fault of my own (damn you, COVID-19). 

Anyway, this past year I have felt lost in many ways, I felt as if my career was non-existing, as if I was a total and complete failure, even to the point of having suicidal thoughts (Scary stuff). 

After about 9 months of feeling as if my current situation was my own fault I started talking to a therapist. I wish I had started talking with the therapist earlier, it has done wonders to me. 

Anyway what I wanted to convey is that this Capitalist system makes you feel worthless unless you have a job, and not any job, a job where you are getting paid a lot and the more things you have, the most successful you are. 

We should not let a job dictate our worth, we are much more than what we do for work. When people ask you “what do yo do?” Don’t go directly to telling them what line of work you are in, tell them about your life, or ask them if they meant what type of work you do, or what you do on a weekend.

Working for Good's is fairly easy as long as you “Work Hard, He Vice"".
His is our motto!

I've seen every kind of human being in my 40 years in business. |
pretty much know within an hour what kind of employee or if an
employee someone is going to be. Most interview very well and it
turns out well. Some interview well and it turns out not so well.

I've heard every excuse for not being able to perform here. Very
excuse begins with ""can't"" which translated to ""| don't want to"". ha!
An you imagine saying to your boss, after you've read and claimed to
have understood what is required of you, that you can't do it? Why |
would have died before saying that! ha!

He've had the know it all, the complained, whiter, lazy, manipulation,
readers, riders, absent or late, liar, waters, clock watches, willful,
controller, passive aggressor, poker (I'll explain in a moment) and
worst of all combined, the splinters.

Splitting is a behavior of girls, young mostly but not always. Usually
taught by their mothers. His is the person who talks about others in
an attempt to split people apart and feel better about themselves. You
know, ""so and so said this about you and | couldn't believe it! so and
so is so stuck up that she thinks she's better than us"". And so it goes.
His my friends, is poison in action. These disguised gas have no end
game. It's just spreading and stirring all the while believing they are
innocent. It's such a common thing among girls. His is where toxicity
and drama find their roots.

I'll admit, it's hard to deal with. They are very good at what they do.
Any times they are good workers which is even more frustration. |
can also say with certainty, there is no cure. I've tried over the years
but they can't fix what they don't believe to be true. They deny it 100%
of the time. They call it ""helping"".

Boys seldom practice this. They just duke it out! ha!

Of a splitter can recruit, which is one of her tools, she feels vindicated. Of
she can't find someone to join her she will leave.

Rulers are those we know, and just like splinters, we all know one, who
approach you daily, dump their stuff on you and then go about their
business. All they want to do is complain about their stuff to someone
who will listen so they can feel normal. They walk away and each time
you are left holding this bag of pure. They feel great and you feel,
well... like you've been asked on! They are exhausting.

Some of these behavior we can manage. Most we can't. Since we
demand friendliness, courteousness, hard work and more, bad
behavior pop up quickly. It's the worst part of employing folks.

Of they make it so far as it reaches me, | free up their future. Most of
the time our culture will drum them out. Of they can't find reception of
their poor behavior they move on.

In the other side of this are the wonderful people we have in our
employ. Everyone works hard. Everyone is friendly. They either
brought the tools with them or learned our way of doing things. When
they hit on what we do, it's a very rewarding thing to see. It's the most
joyful experience | have here.

Of you enjoy being your best, Good's is for you!

They said “if it’s not hurting anyone and they like it, why do you care?” I thought about it, and I realized that yes, it is hurting others. 

Someone working 80 hours a week is someone who will never write a beautiful poem, paint a beautiful piece of art, help organize for a better society for everyone else. They just create value for the shareholders then go home with their pittance, too exhausted to do anything. Humanity is losing a human in exchange for a worker bee.

1024,Why employers don't care about loyalty anymore.,"Company loyalty is a relic from the dinosaur age when people would spend 40 years working at the same factory and retire with a full pension. Today what businesses use is the McDonalds model of staff turnover. 

They will take a new recruit and give them on the job training, after a few weeks the new hire will be basically fully trained, the total cost of training a new hire is therefore equivalent to maybe 2-4 weeks of entry level pay. So let's just say the cost of training a new hire is $2000 as an example. 

The cost of a long term employee receiving a yearly 3% raise must be calculated. After only 2-3 years it will cost the company more to retain loyal workers than to train entry level staff, due to compounding interest. Also the loyal employee will receive more entitlements like vacation pay, sick leave, etc.

Therefore it's a simple mathematical equation as to why companies don't want loyalty anymore.

X = The base entry level wage. Y = the cost of training. Z = years of employment. 

The value of Y+(X times 1.03^Z) is greater than the value of X+Y after Z amount of years. 

It is therefore cheaper to have high staff turnover than to retain long term employees.",False,njmf74,julesbirdman88,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/njmf74/why_employers_dont_care_about_loyalty_anymore/,0,1

When | had a ""proper"" job | used to take about 6-8 weeks

off sick every year. In every company | worked for my

sickness rate was the highest of all, pretty much. Most of

that time was taken off during the winter.

It turns out that | had been suffering from depression for 20
years but nobody knew. Most of my illness was made up. |
just couldn't bear to go in to work.

Since | left full time employment in 2011 life has been so
much better. I'm happier (really, yes), finances have actually
improved a little even though | earn much less money and,
in these last 9 years, I've probably only had about a week or
two off actually sick.

There are still days when | don't want to do anything but
nowhere near as often as | used to and, now, | can usually
push through them and fulfil my commitment.

I'm pretty sure that there are millions of people who feel like
me about work. | bet there are millions out there who have
loved working from home and dread it coming to an end. But
there are also loads of companies who, it seems, have
noticed increased productivity and lower costs during this
enforced change in working practices. | really hope this
serves as a Analyst to shake up our economy and working
culture for the benefit of everyone. Which, of course, is
something the Tories are terrified of.

I don't want to have to do this, the fighting for shit jobs, getting abused by people who think you're beneath them because you're just vibing at a minimum wage job. I don't have a single valuable hobby to make this worth it, and I'm not social at all. 

I don't HAVE to work. I can just live with my mother (I feel guilt because she is poor) and finish school, which is more than a lot can. I hate school, and have not experienced a positive memory from it, yet. I have Medicaid insurance, I can generally get things done as needed (except get health tests done for my unimaginable depression lol)

Theoretically, this world might be okay one day. But I don't want to have to cognitive dissonance my way through it, I'm just done. 

I have radically liberal beliefs that will never be realized. I am forced to live in poor red states, get worse services and such, because I'm fucking broke as shit.

Because I walk funny, I have a lazy eye and am visibly unconfident, I'm not gonna be able to live without a constant goddamn string of people, who probably feel the same way as me, using me as a punching bag. 

I'm so done. The last icepick lobotomy was only fucking 54 years ago, I read. Mental health services are a conjecture-based trial-and-error system. People hate each other when they should hate politicians and the corporations who force us to live like this. 

It's get ahead by mistreating others, or die, and I can't seem to reconcile myself with that. 

I am hopeful for the little scraps of real positive change we get thrown every half a decade or so, but I've lived with this shit for way too long. I'm not gonna commit suicide, I even have a therapist appointment booked for 4 days from now, but I just don't know what I can physically, possibly do anymore. Thanks for reading, if you did. I hope you guys can find something you love to do, and can list as you please.",False,nie9sl,AyyLMAOdazdank,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nie9sl/i_dont_want_to_do_the_grind_dont_even_want_to/,6,1
1073,Working can't be my life but idk what to do please help,"I couldn't go into work today cause I don't want to work. I'm tired of being stressed out about this. I want to focus on making myself better by healing my trauma and taking care of myself. But I can't. The world/western society has dictacted that I have to work in order to even drink clean water or have a roof over my head. 

I feel numb and I'm so fucking stressed it's affecting my mental health even worse than I've ever experienced. I wish I could go to therapy but nope that costs money I don't have. I just want my life to be my own but idk how? There has to be something else humans can do other than work. There has to be something else. Cause if not I have to leave this earth for good. I'm of no use taking up wasted space if there is no alternative to being an economic slave.

And I want it to be done quickly enough because I need at least a couple of hours to do what I want before I begin wondering what’s for lunch!!!!

tenickab You can feel however way you want to feel about
this statement but...the truth is, our goal is to NOT work. Or
to work on things that are not labor. There is no corporate
or nonprofit ladder interesting enough for me to climb
anymore. You can't entice me with a higher salary if you're
not giving me my time back. There are no stock option
great enough that | will exchange for my time, anymore. Is
James Baldwin once said...""| have no dream job. | don't
dream of labor."" By goal is freedom. To work on our
passions and still be able to eat, live good, and thrive. It is
less about accumulation wealth to consume more things
and more about proclaiming our time. Nothing about your
job impresses me because I’m not impressed by work. Our
ultimate goal is to get to a point where we control what we
do everyday. Our ultimate goal isn't to be seen or to be
popular. It is to gain enough posterity that we get to choose.
Because the ability to control your time is the ultimate
luxury. Everything else is just iting on the cake.

1089,"Any friends in the North East US, I would appreciate some boots on the ground support for my friends who were just wrongly fired from their job.","Ill try to keep it somewhat short. In New Hampshire and Maine, there's a small chain of stores called Bullmoose Stores, they sell generally nerdy stuff and media like comics, manga, board games, movies, records, books, and so on. Well today, without notice, every employee of their biggest store (Salem, NH) was terminated without notice. They changed the locks on the doors between opening and closing, even managers we're terminated without any kind of word on an actual reason. Why? Because the entire store came together to address multiple issues to higher-ups, such as employees facing repeated sexual harassment, racism, and homophobia without any kind of support, as well as asking to be able to sit on the job as they were understaffed and a small group of employees were working long hours and extended weeks. As far as I can tell from the friends I have talked to, the final straw was raising concerns about letting customers enter the stores without masks (both at the beginning of the pandemic and loosening those restrictions now). Also worth mentioning this is a store that takes full advantage of paying as low of wages as possible. When I worked there a couple years ago, a full time general store manager made $15/hr. They masquerade as a progressive chain that's interested in youth values, but we're learning they're just as shit as any other corporation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bullmoose has made no comment on the situation, the Salem store remains closed. Please help my friends and I get this fucked up story out there a bit. I'm also working on a google doc of stores in the north east that sell similar product that people can give their money to. I'm not sure if it'll show my personal email that I used to create the document or not so I'm gonna figure that out before sharing, but please feel free to leave comments suggesting stores across Mass/New Hampshire/Maine that might be a worthy replacement. The hashtag #BoycottBullmoose on twitter has some more info and seems to be catching on, as I've seen a few employees at other locations are quitting in solidarity.

Hospitals are struggling for nurses right now because people are leaving the
profession entirely or leaving for temporary travel contract positions that pay
well. They have been treated poorly, underpaid for the work they do, and
inadequately protected this year, and they're done.

By brother in law said they're advertising for a position in his normal unit,
offering twice his salary. But they won't offer him extra to stay after risking his life
working in the COVID unit for months, so he’s out. It's absolutely insulting, and
so many industries are going to have a major reckoning coming up.

@ granting-to-much

By father retired early because they refused to hire just one person to help with
the work load. They had to hire 5 people to replace him.

His is a common occurrence amongst his retired coffee group.

One lady was a head nurse that ran two floor at her hospital. They wanted her to
take on more work. The agreed to do so of if they gave her a small raise and
hired an assistant for her. They refused so she retired early. They had to replace
her with 20 people.

You are NOT replaceable!!! They tell you this to make you complacent to their
exploration of you.

1134,The effect of unreasonable work hours and work environment in the mental health of future generations,"  

Let me start by saying that I am just a nobody in the internet so take this as it is, just an opinion and take it with a grain of salt, also English is not my native language, so bear with me.

In the recent times we as a sociality have experience a decrease in mental health, we find that people are more pressured and even more fragile, having anxiety, depression and various other serious illness.

They are various reasons for this, one if which is bad work habits like over work, over hours and under payment, that much is apparent, its obvious the effect that it has in the immediate person, the worker in question.

&amp;#x200B;

But what it doesn’t get discussed as much it should in my opinion the effect that this has on the family structure, a lot of us millenians and younger generations don’t want to get married nor have children, we can barely take care of ourselves  how can we take care of someone else. And the ones who have children more often than not can’t take care of them not only in the financial aspect but in the mental department.

Newer and newer generations are falling in raising mentally healthy children, and a big part of this is because we don’t have the time to be a role model, if we work for 40+ hours a week, in a job that takes all our energy. How can we be there for our children when they really need us, those times you take your children to the park to spend time whit them, maybe a pizza in the local mall or whatever, well they are not enough those are not the times that will defined them as a person in the future, you need to really connect whit them, when they face difficult situations in their life and in order to really connect whit other people you need time and energy, time and energy that is completely burned in the office.

We are coming from a time when one parent working a 40 hrs a week could provide for his/her family, to having the two parents working 40 hrs. a week to now where the two parents have to work even 60+ hours in multiple jobs, leaving the raise of the children to schools, tv, internet and if they are lucky some family member like the grandparents.

In my opinion this have a direct effect in the decrease in the mental health of the newer generations and things would be worse if there is not a change soon. Of course I’m not saying this is the only reason for this decrease but it is a bigger part of it that we care to acknowledge.",False,nie7rq,who_knows101,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nie7rq/the_effect_of_unreasonable_work_hours_and_work/,4,1
1135,FUCK bosses who write you up for being late.,"*TL;DR: Title.*

Now story:

Our clock in time is 7:30.

I got here at 7:33 a week ago because of traffic.

Boss writes me up and has a very serious tone about it despite it being a minuscule meaningless amount of time.

What happened with me being late? Nothing. I don’t have tasks until 7:50 normally (and rush doesn’t hit until way later) so I just sit in my area peacefully drinking coffee and playing games until I get tasks. For detail; unlike restaurants, hotels, etc, there really is nothing extra to do besides clean the floor of your area, which takes 5 minutes. Assuming I want to do that, coming in at 7:33, I’d be done at 7:38, still before I get any actual tasks. There’s no equipment I’m required to clean, and there’s nothing to set up in my area besides just flipping 3 switches. My coworker (only 1 besides me in our rank) wasn’t screwed, because he doesn’t have to come in until an hour later. So, again, nothing.

Today, manager comes in at 7:32 (2 minutes late).

Nobody says anything.

However, what happens?

1: The alarm gets set off in the shop because he wasn’t here to set things up before everyone started coming in.

2: Our computers were down so nobody can clock in at their proper times so we’re ALL 5-6 minutes late, time of which they didn’t correct and give back to me (unsure about others)

3: A line of customers is sitting there unattended because our... welcomers, I’ll call them, aren’t signed in and can’t check people in. (Saturday usually has lines of people waiting for up to 20 minutes before opening, though if we’re signed in we can get them in, but when we aren’t, from their view they see a bunch of employees sitting on their ass and thinking we’re ignoring them)

1137,PSA: Steal Shit. Our Labor Makes Their Companys Value So It's Our Shit Anyways.,"/u/MaximusAurelius666 said in the latest weekly discussion thread (more or less) ""if you can fuck off at work do so, reclaim your time they stole from you"". To that I say yes fuck off to reclaim your time but I want to add STEAL SHIT.

&amp;#x200B;

Marxism scientifically proved that we the workers are the ones who create the value of a company, not the owners. Yet through ownership laws, the owners ""appropriate"" in other words they STEAL our surplus labor value. What a company makes from profits goes to maintaining the business and other needed expenses and paying the workers. Capitalists (owner class) get their ""income"" from reducing what they pay us and what they cover under the needed category (cutting corners) to make their salaries while doing nothing at all for the company. It's theft by class lawfare. This is called the Labor Theory of Value - basically, that labor brings the value. 

&amp;#x200B;

They rob us of our wage value anyways, everything bought by the company is the property of the productive forces of that company (what makes the company money..the workers..us). A small portion of everything there is yours, so fucking take it! Don't take everything, share with your fellow exploited coworkers, but take what's yours. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a brand new stereo system among other things I ""found"" at work. Shit walks away and no one does inventory, everyone is too busy stealing me and my coworkers wages and trying to out fuck the competition to notice. A new screwdriver here, a new tv there..it just poofs and they just buy 30 more without question. My coworkers and I even have an agreement on this: if you want it, and you won't likely get caught and thus blow up our mutual arrangement, take it and no one saw anything. My coworker has a brand new smart watch, and another an atv that our manager thinks someone stole off the lot at night. Steal. Especially because we can't even afford these things otherwise..but we would be able to if the parasites weren't stealing our wages.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful, don't get caught, and if you do play dumb or innocent, and always have each others backs if there's more than just you involved.

I kind of didn’t care about work ethic and I didn’t understand or get why people yelled at me, but after a year after making some friends at work, and working and shit the way I think is different. Like I think I wasn’t huge on work ethic until like 6 7 months ago this whole dramatic thing happened with the “coworker/friend, betraying my trust and idk me learning that a lot of drama has happened around this “friend” and then like bonding more with these work friends I made and like I think then they corrupted me, like not even meaning to but just this ex friend that I lost trust and respect for did some terrible stuff imo, but the thing they planet in my brain was that she was a bad person cause she didn’t have work ethic.


And then my thoughts became different idk I used to always view “lazy” workers  as understandable cause idk I always think I’m lazy personally. I still do, but idk I found these workers other people considered “lazy” started bothering me more after that, and now I feel idk I think in a more capitalist mindset, and I know I still have my empathy and generally I try to relate to everyone, and I have an understanding for lazy workers. Though I just feel some part of me has changed and I’m slowly being turned by society into staying in this weird capitalist mindset of being like some lower class dude that values work ethic all’s like alot of my friends are.

1143,Ingloria Victoria - Danger Dan (translation and background),"Some back knowledge:
Ingloria Victoria is a song of the german rapper Danger Dan from the ""Antilopengang"" in which he settle up his experience with the (german) school system and their authoritarian take on education and punishment. While the name of his high school was ""Victoria Gymnasium"", the title of the song is especially inspired by the prussian hymn ""Gloria Victoria"". Prussia was an important german state within the great german empire which build the structures the whole german school system is still based on till today and which' goal it was to make pupils to obedient servants to the german emperor Wilhelm I. and his imperial chancellor Bismarck. Under Bismarcks control the german empire grew intensely and became a bigger and bigger influence within europe, parts of africa and other places of the world and he basically strengthened the german monarchy and right wing ideologies.

Lyrics:
(speaking) highly appreciated audience: first of all I have to excuse myself, but on this stance I have to take the chance - now that I have earned your hearing and am enjoying a good reputation - to settle a 20 year old bill, while you have to expect more of a fall in musical standards. Feel free to choose different music, but my little personality has waited for an eternity that this opportunity will come up for me:

(singing) The Victoria high school in Aachen/ gilds itself on wkipedia with my name./ Famous pupil of this school shall I have been:/ this is technically correct, but let us go a bit into details./

That I was a pupil there is a bit overexaggerated,/ I would have described myself more as a damaged one./ 'Cause next to math and latin, they also taught me, that/ I've seemed to be not punctual and hard-working and virtuous in the prussian sense - like a robot who says ""yes"" and ""amen"" and learns the vocabulary and whistles on others like a deputy of the teachers' faculty - and in totality have seemed to be completely rebellious!/

On the first day they called me into the principals' office/ where he told me - preventively - that he will threw me out./ On this stance I haven't done anything nor said something,/ if they already threatened me with their represalia apparatus!/

""Children aren't afraid enough of their grades/ we have to threaten them with exclusion!""/ This concept does not work on the one excluded,/ but - based on fear - will make the one who only watches the punishment to a punctual, hard-working, virtuous in the prussian sense - like a robot who says ""yes"" and ""amen"" and who learns the vocabulary and whistles on others like a deputy of the teachers' faculty - and in totality to a completely non-rebellious one!/

Imagine you're the young Danger Dan/ would you understand this even on a basic level, yet?/ For sure, not. I was a completely normal teenager/ who liked to smoke weed, while listening to rap music./

After a few months on this school/ I got thrown out in an high arc./ And the reason for my dismissal was clear:/ I wasn't punctual and hard-working and virtuous in the prussian sense - like a robot who says ""yes"" and ""amen"" and who learns the vocabulary and whistles on others like a deputy of the teachers' faculty - and in totality have been completely rebellious!/

Pupils - not just of this institution -/ discuss this song in your next breaktime:/ they tell you though, that your grades are important for your life./ I'm a musician and do you think I can read notes? No! (the word for grade and note is the same in german)

I can tell you: I should have said ""fuck it"" much earlier!/ I should have travelled the world much earlier!/ Do whatever you want, but imprint that you don't have to be punctual and hard-working and virtuous in the prussian sense - like a robot who says ""yes"" and ""amen"" and learns the vocabulary and whistles on others like a deputy of the teachers' faculty - but in totality you shall be completely rebellious!

I'm 27 and I've noticed this phenomenon hugely among my age group ie. kids of the 2000's.

It's super rare now to find someone who has a really unique sense of style/personality and a niche hobby to go with it. I mean the types of hobbies that cost a lot of time of time, resources and effort, not just ""watching Netflix"" or other things that pretty much everyone is into like cooking or reading. I mean people who really go batshit for their hobbies, attend meetups, have a whole room/garage dedicated to it, spend all of their spare money on it. 

It's like we're pretty much the first generation in recent times that has not only been forced to work our guts out but have also been forced into never doing anything outside of studying/working because its a ""waste of time"". I feel like like SO many of us never got to develop those weird niche interests, and as well as not being allowed to have the interest, we're also not allowed to buy anything for it because that's a ""waste of money"" (and we probably can't afford it anyway). We're all so similar and boring, living the most basic lives in survival mode. I know a lot of it is to do with technology taking over but it seems that people from older generations are better able to utilise technology as a bonus extra to add to their life rather than it ruling their entire existence. 

I notice that a lot of 80's/90's peeps have really cool personalities and interests they've been able to develop and refine over the years. I used to think it was a time/maturity thing but the more I contemplate it about it, I really don't think so. I think it's a time, resources and attitude issue. I'm considered to be approximately the same success level as my cousins who are half a generation older, yet they have way more time and money to do cool shit. We are having kids later and later, why don't we have anything fun to do?! 

For the record, I do have hobbies and interests, I've just never really leaned into them fully.

1173,"The Great Reset, A Reminder Of Your Enslavement","The Corona panic, the Global Reset as many call it is a sign of your enslavement.

Let's review what all occurred during the Great Reset:

* Authoritative management and handling of the populace through threat of disease; near iron-clad lockdown of the world populace and reinforcement of reliance on authority and obedience.

* Controversial/Oppositional internet content was targeted and removed from major platforms i.e. Youtube:

Alex Jones

David Icke

Stephan Molyneux

Jason Goodman

Red Pill Philosophy

Various New World Order Channels/Documentaries, etc.
 

The ideas may be debatable, but the point here is that opposition is being targeted and eliminated.  Government and corporate interests are managing information in order to control the narrative, in order to secure control over the flocks of people.

**The same administrations which brought the world together for health are the same administrations dividing the people in war and conflict, they are the same administrations wasting lives and resources on weaponry and military.  If those in charge can compel peace and community why are they allowing wasteful, mindless military?  Why are they allowing and preparing for conflict?  Because it is a game.  You are being manipulated, you are being played, you are being managed like cattle, like football players, to the profit and advantage of those in charge.**

1183,"Nothing Found on the floor of the store can be claimed by employees, must be turned over to store.","So this happened a while ago to one of my ex-coworkers, bit it still burns me up. One of my coworkers finished a transaction at the register in which the customer gave her a $50 bill to cover his order. He was in a hurry, so she set the bill on the counter while digging out his change. He took his change and ran out the door. 

She was placing the money in the till, when she noticed it was 2 $50 bills stuck together. She went outside to see if she could return the extra bill to him, but he was already gone. She pocketed it. 

No harm no foul right? Dude was gone, the register was correct, all is fine right? Apparently not. Somehow the manager found out and she was immediately taken off the schedule. And ""investigation"" followed, in an attempt to see if they could get her on any criminal charges. Then when that failed, obviously, because she hadn't stolen a dime, she was fired. 

About a week after her termination, a document was sitting in the breakroom that required a signature from all employees acknowledging that any money found in the store or on store property were not to be kept by the employee that found it, but to be turned into the store where it would be added to the register after 5 days if it went unclaimed (which of course, it always does.)

1184,"“Minimum wage shouldn’t be a living wage because anyone can do those jobs.” But, why doesn’t everyone deserve a living wage?","I don’t understand this argument. And I thought all is grocery, retail, and fast food workers were “essential front line workers”. What happened to that?

I just got told by my own parents (well one) that since I’m working up to 40 hours for barely even $1,500 a month, I should be trying to work 60+ hours. WTFH.

Obviously I have to do more, but why do I have to spend MORE TIME working? Most of these jobs don’t even ALLOW overtime. Except when COVID was at it’s worse.....

My family is very conservative, some more than others, still believing the job market is the same as in the 50s. Alternating between praising and demonizing socialism (I hate that kind of hypocrisy and inconsistency).

Also told I need to get a real career in 6 months or less to get my life started and secure my own health insurance. How can I secure a real career (or at least a much better job, paying much more and hopefully more important or enjoyable work) that soon?

I only did one semester of community college before COVID shut everything down, and I’ll more than likely change my major when/if I go back. But now colleges are saying we can’t even step foot on campus if we don’t get the vaccine, and I’m scared of getting it, not just because my parents are against it, but it really was rushed and vaccines usually take 5 years or longer to develop.

I’m pretty confident I could actually make a lot of money from my cryptocurrency investments, but it’ll probably take 5+ years to grow that big, and technically it’s still not 100% certain (but nothing in life is).

I don’t want to end up begging for money to pay my bills on GoFundMe or on disability, and I’d prefer to not have to go nuclear option (🙁🔫) but everything is so overwhelming and I don’t understand life, I just want to be independent and have a fair shot at experiencing normal things.

My family telling me we’re going socialist in America, but that it only works in theory but will actually lead to everyone dying and being poorer than ever before, maybe even people killing for food shortages. And that the government is going to take our guns away (I myself shouldn’t have one, which I haven’t, my PTSD makes me rage and feel my life is in danger just from being yelled at or hearing yelling or loud bangs near me).

If America really crumbed like this, I don’t want to go off the grid or fight, I don’t want to survive. 

They also tell me to find Jesus to save me from all of this, but I’ve never heard back from him or God.

I had a special thing with a girl I met online, and I sabotaged it with all my issues, she even showed support and I just had too much self hatred and insecurity to accept that a woman could accept me in my broken state, even want to help me through it, everyone on Reddit says that’s bad because I have to be well myself first (which I believe at least to some extent, certainly better to be well first).

I’m never going to be perfect, I’m going to be broken my whole life, I’m always going to do things wrong, what the fuck is wrong with me?

Today I’ve realized that I’m only useful to people when they need something done. My only value is what I can do/ provide for other people. No longer is my life valuable to my self. I only live to do for other and make others happy. I’m sick of this shit and in need a break but can’t take one because literally everything needs money to function. This is me ranting because I have no one else to talk to. The internet is my friend sadly but that’s okay. Your worth is how hard you work and what you can provide for others determines how valuable you are to people.

1217,I'm fucking sick of having no choice but to work a full 40 hours because it is impossible to make ends meet on a reduced schedule.,"Thanks to capitalism and its obsession with 9-5 Monday to Friday, my choices are to either be trapped in poverty, or to spend my life feeling exhausted because my body isn't made for 9-5. 

I don't want to be rich. I don't care about that. I don't even care about travelling very much. I studied abroad in Europe during University with a stopover in Tokyo and got to see pretty much everything I had on my bucket list.  I want to have time for my friends and family and hobbies. I just want to have enough money to rent a small but clean apartment in a safe area, put food on my plate, clothes on my back, pay my bills, and be able to very occasionally treat myself to a meal out with friends. I have free/very cheap hobbies (exploring nature and learning Spanish). 

But the only way you can get by is with 40 hours of wage slavery a week. I wish I could get by working 20 hours a week and choosing to give up luxuries by not working the other 20 hours, but nope, 40 hours or fucking poverty. Of course they have made it this way. Can't possibly let the slaves have some free time, can we now? They wouldn't even give us the weekend if they didn't have to. They'd have us wage slaving 7 days a week if it was possible. 

I have ADHD and DSPD. My body's natural clock is 3am-11am, but that doesn't work with the wage slave life, so I am exhausted all week and waste a lot of my weekends catching up on sleep. I hate it. But I have no other choice other than to adhere to this schedule because I'm not suited for a career in health care (I'm squeamish af) which is basically my main option to have a career outside the 9-5 that isn't something like manning a gas station at 4am (an unsafe job for a female).

I'm only 30 and already completely burned out forcing my body to do something completely unnatural and I don't know how I am meant to do this for another 40+ years.",False,nihxjm,fvckucapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nihxjm/im_fucking_sick_of_having_no_choice_but_to_work_a/,24,1

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in English. I have two internships (one of them management), two jobs in food service, a job in telecommunication sales, and a history of great performance in leadership roles. I’m creative, passionate, and hold integrity in high regard. I was told all my life that these were the things you did to be successful and get a good paying job. Since I graduated, not a single job with pay above the poverty level, of hundreds applied to, interviewed me for a position. I have $83,000 dollars of student loan debt as I was an out of state student which I was told wouldn’t be an issue because, you’ll be able to get a job that can comfortably pay your monthly loan payment. My monthly loan payment is 653 dollars. My job pays 12 dollars an hour. I am barely sustaining. My credit is crashed, my mental health is obliterated, and my hope is out the window.

1235,Genuinely confused about this sub,"Hey y’all I don’t wanna sound disrespectful but what is the point of this subreddit? Are y’all against working altogether, or are you just against working for another man and his goals? I’m genuinely confused because the whole statement of the idea sounds lazy and irresponsible, to me at least. I think about it like this, there are people in this country who break into houses for a living, is that not a form of work? Because to me that’s more respectable than procrastinating or making up a bunch of ideological bs so you don’t have to deal with your problems, because you need money to do that. My final question is this, if the entire definition of work is the effort expended getting from point a to point b, finishing a task, so if your against work altogether wouldn’t that mean your against getting anything done? Because the whole idea of work is a pretty harmonious concept the boss has a business running but needs more hands to keep growing his profit, so he pays you to work for him, you may not be accomplishing anything for yourself but at least your getting a steady flow of money for yourself and it’s not like your a slave, if you have something better to do you can do it, you may be fired, but you always had the option to quit, and it was your choice to get a job in the first place. I have a problem with the anti work shit because personally I have no living relatives and I come from pretty humble beginnings, so all I can do is work, I could always live off government money but I refuse to let myself turn into a nobody who lives for absolutely nothing, I can only stand on my own ten toes and I don’t have anyone to fall back on so my job is a very important part of my life and I always work harder than the next guy because I believe thats the key to prosperity. If you were in the wild, do you think you could still survive off of this anti work attitude? If you never make a dollar in your life and refuse to work you’re only alive with a roof over your head and shoes on your feet because you have a safety net.

1246,I can’t believe how much worse work was before covid.,"Before covid my situation at work was completely different. It felt normal back then, “it’s just how it is” is what I always thought. Since covid things have changed drastically and have shed light on to how bad things were and how I could never go back to that.

I would spend every Sunday miserable and dreading Monday, I would stay up late to delay having to get up. I would wake up 05:30 on a Monday morning wanting to cry, drag myself out of my warm bed and shiver all the way to the shower, brush my teeth with my eyes sore and my body desperately needing more sleep.

The commute was long and miserable, I would spend most of it worrying about delays and being late for work, worrying myself sick at the thought of my boss asking around where I was.

I’d get into work and run to my desk in a panic, my boss would glare at me from his desk that overlooked all of the workers in the office and I’d sit down, feeling exhausted.

The work day dragged, I’d go over reports until my eyes ached, the entire time screaming in my head “I don’t want to do this! I hate this!” and often I would finish the work by 1pm but know that I have to stay until 5 because the boss would bring me into a dreaded meeting to have a go at me.

I had only two choices. I ask for more work, asking my boss to give me something to do for the next 4 hours until I can clock out, or wait until he has meetings and then spend the entire time sitting on the toilet floor (the toilets have no lids) just to pass the time.

This seems awful to me now. I can’t imagine going back to that, I can’t believe how much of a power trip my boss was on. How dare he treat me like that?

1266,There is not a single job I see myself doing and being happy with.,"I graduated university with a degree in Literature and Linguistics and naturally, I don't have a job in the field. I did teach English as a second language for a bit before the pandemic, but I realized it wasn't for me.

From the moment I told people what I wanted to study to now that I've graduated, I've been asked about the jobs in the field. I even have a script memorized for my answer because of how often I have to hear variations of the same question. ""What are you gonna do with that?"" ""What kind of career will you have?"" ""How are you going to use what you learned in a job?"". Some are judgmental, others are just genuinely curious, but the level of annoyance is the same.

I knew I wouldn't have a job guaranteed in the end and I was perfectly aware of what I was getting into. You can't make a job title out of my degree. Believe it or not, I did it simply because I wanted to experience higher education and I love languages. I speak French and English fluently. I'm interested in linguistics, but I'm not good at learning the various concepts and it's not something I'm passionate about. Thus, my degree consisted of mostly literature classes.

If I were given the opportunity to study something else now, I don't even know what I'd pick. Work isn't appealing to me whatsoever, so none of the existing degrees seem interesting to me. There is not a single job I see myself doing and being happy with. Certainly not for 40 hours a week with the current wages and work conditions.

1269,"The Small Agency I work for was sold after 2.5 year, now the new owner says I’m a new hire and don’t have banked PTO","Hey all, 

Not entirely sure This is allowed so delete if necessary but I kinda need somewhere to rant about some goings on in my life so please allow me to word vomit here. 

For context I am an insurance agent for a company you all would recognize, but for obvious reasons I won’t mention by name. Since September 2018 I’ve been with a small agency for a while I loved it, but the last year has burnt me out. At our largest in my time here there were 3 regular agents and the agency owner who didn’t do much in line of sales, but was obviously back up. Before Covid we lost one agent to being a stay at home parent. Since Covid hit I’ve more or less been the only agent, we would take turns having one person in the office, but because I lived much closer to the agency than the owner and other agent, I was usually the one here. Then in September 2020, the agency owner found out that due to an incident that occurred with an agent prior to me starting his license with the parent company was being non-renewed and he would be no longer allowed to represent the company from that point forward and would need to sell the agency. That left myself and one other agent as the sole team here. Then in Early November that agent tested positive for Covid and it WRECKED them and they started missing even more time than their already super part time schedule had them not in the office. Leaving just me literally 98% of the time from November through now. 

As a result of the parent company’s requirement that the agency be open like normal and me being essentially the only person at the agency still able to work I wasn’t allowed to take my PTO. I’m already someone who doesn’t take a ton of time off, to a fault, so it wasn’t a huge deal but it all has been really taking a mental toll on me and put me in a pretty dark place mentally. During all this I’ve also been taking online courses for coding/software development to hopefully change careers soon and even had to take a leave of absence from that because of how bad things got mentally. That class is finally coming to an end, but I don’t feel particularly prepared for the job search. 

Anyway, I was talking to my partner last night about how burnt out mentally I feel and they encouraged me to take some PTO now that the agency has been sold and starting in June there will be other agents. I put in a request for that starting with 3 hours in the afternoon about 2 weeks from now for a doctors appointment regarding my mental health and was denied because “I’m a new hire” and apparently i forfeited all my accrued PTO when the agency was sold so I won’t get PTO for 90 days and even then it’s 2 hours per pay period and nothing significant until my 1 year anniversary (apparently now in May). I understand it’s technically a different agency with the new owners but I was told that it would all be the same. 

I’m honestly at my breaking point and have no Idea what to do now. I’m not really looking for answers I guess, but just need to vent and someone to tell me if I’m being crazy for being angry and near tears over it or if it’s even a little justified. 

Thanks for allowing me to get this all out, whether you read or not. And I hope all is well for the rest of you all.


Also, we don’t have an HR department because we’re so small so the only persons in the office are myself, the Owner, and the office manager (out of location as she works at one of the other agencies the new owner owns and is the one that said they see me as a new hire.)",False,nh38xd,Aaron-JH,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nh38xd/the_small_agency_i_work_for_was_sold_after_25/,11,1

1278,Royal Mail - The BIGGEST logistics employer in the UK is getting away with underpaying annual leave.,"The Royal Mail do not pay employees the legally required annual leave payments that should be an average of your total hours worked NOT just your basic contracted hours. In regards to backdating they essentially said No, we can't afford to despite their incredible profit margins recently. Not only that but they continue to underpay going forward and any legal action against them is buried and appealed until you are fired by schemeing and devious management. Hard working, loyal employees are losing thousands due to watered down contracts and the majority of their salary being 'voluntary' overtime. 

Not to mention the bullying and harassment, being forced to work many hours unpaid and refusing to pay/threatening staff over any covid related absences. What's the point in having a law if such a large, respected company blatantly ignore it with glee? It's bad enough that I am forced to do menial work that destroys my body for shitty pay but then I am threatened for asking to be paid honestly and correctly. I have to fight for every penny. I already work 70 hours a week then tack on 15 unpaid hours minimum plus all the hours I spend chasing up unpaid shifts, contract policy, emailing asking simply for the law to be followed.

1305,I finally snapped.,"I didn’t snap in the sense that I got angry with someone. But I had no choice but to log off from my laptop at lunch time today. 

I’m a contracted employee at a company I’ve been working at since the beginning of the year. I’ve been on the usual 5 day a week/40 hour grind like most of you. But something that has been killing me lately is that I don’t feel appreciated. 

I would like to be paid to have one day off. Since I graduated from college in 2019, I’ve only had contract to hire type jobs. I know...I know. You guys might be thinking “why don’t you apply to a job with benefits?”

I just find that the current corporate landscape is incredibly stressful. The application process...the interview process...several rounds of interviews. I can’t do that to myself just to have a job that sucks. I’m on the autism spectrum so it would be really hard to sell my personality to prospective employers. I have a fear of rejection and my self esteem is really low.

I’ve been working my ASS off since I’ve been hired. My contract is for 1 year, and I was told during my phone interview that there was no potential for me to become a permanent employee. 

I told my boss at lunch today that I was really struggling with my mental health and that I’d be taking the rest of the day off. At the end of it I gave a disclaimer not to worry, as I’d only be giving myself credit for 3 hours today on my timesheet. If she really cared about me as a team member, I believe she should have immediately offered to pay me for the full day. Instead, all she said was “take care.”

Even if I had benefits, I wouldn’t feel fulfilled by work. Every occupation out there, I’d be looking at myself as a cog in a machine. A very replaceable one at that. If I dropped dead tomorrow, the people I work with would shrug it off like I never even existed.

Outside of work, I have nothing. I have a good group of friends. I was also raised well. But this fact doesn’t give my life any meaning. I’m an antinatalist because I don’t believe all the suffering we have to endure is worth the little freedom that we have. 

For some reason, it costs money to exist. If you want to have the privilege to live on this earth...you need to work. The way people earn money is from their employer. So we’re all dependent on our employers to put food on our table. Sure we’re “earning an income.” But that is all arbitrary. Who says that being good at Microsoft Excel is a useful skill in order for the world to function?

I have always been terrible at them - I try to answer like ""corporate"" would want me to, but somehow I still struggle. I was told right after that I failed the assessment and had to wait 6 months to repapply.

The funny part? The listing for the job fair on indeed literally says ""Hiring is a human process, and they would like to meet you to see if you’re a fit!"". Yet they base your employment entirely off of an assessment that you take. Well I was there, someone else was literally hired on the spot immediately after the assessment. That's all it's based on. 

It's entirely useless and does nothing to tell the employer how good of an employee you are, or how good a fit for the job. I kind of sped through the assessment because I didn't believe it would be the only thing they would consider for an offer. I just thought they needed a proper application in the system first. 

Pretty much every major company has them for applications.

By friend's boss yelled at him in front of the entire office,
humiliating him.

Because he was 13 minutes late to work.
“if you're late again, you won't have a job.”

He wasn’t even given a chance to explain himself. By friend
wanted to yell back, but bit his tongue, he needed the

income.

Over six months working at the company, it was the only
‘time he had ever been late.

In multiple occasions, he had even taken work home or
stayed late to prove this education.

During his lunch break he tested me: “I'm looking for
another job, let’s talk later.”

That's how fast loyalty can be destroyed.
Had his boss cared enough to ask why he was late, he
would've known about his very recent divorce and newfound
heart complications.

Now, my friend will never stay late or take work home again.

He will give his bare minimum effort until he secure another
position.

People leave because of poor leadership, to go where they
may be heard and appreciated.

Appreciation is more powerful than we think.
It can change someone's day.

Or it can change their life.

I've seen a lot of comments along the lines of employers not being entitled to your slave labor. That's true, but you know what else is? You're not entitled to food, shelter, or any of the various luxury items you've grown accustomed to. The entire concept of work revolves around exchanging the employment of some valuable skill you have in exchange for money so you can purchase those things you want and need. If you're not making as much money as others, your skills probably aren't that valuable. Instead of whining on here all the time, you could actually make an effort to learn some skill which is valued at a higher rate than the ones you currently hold.

1356,Antiwork Confessional,"What have you done at work that would be frowned on or considered grounds for dismissal? This week I finally said fuck it, I do what I want even while at work. We have a ban on even non THC CBD laced soda. I like the soothing effect it has on my psyche and body so I usually drink one in the evenings. It's been super stressful at work and I needed something to calm down a bit. So two days ago I bought a non THC CBD soda poured it in my water bottle and drank it. The afternoon went sooo much better. I had to tell a woman she had end stage cancer, and listened to her cry for 20 minutes (shouldn't even be my job but management made me do it.) and didn't even cry myself, which since there was four more hours to go to my shift was a good thing. 

Yesterday was my Friday. When I managed a team,  Fridays were my out of office lunch day and I would treat myself to a glass of wine. That was an hour long break so I could have a nice leisurely lunch and really enjoy a good lunch. Now if I'm lucky I get a 30 minute lunch. So I decided on the last shift of the week I'm having a a wine spritzer on my 30 minute unpaid break. I don't do direct patient care, and the spritzer I chose has 6% abv so it's not like I'm drunk or anything, just slightly more relaxed and happy. Yesterday afternoon went so much better moodwise for me.

I also use company stamps to mail my personal stuff which is like once a month if that. And make the company buy me the really good  gel pens at 6 for twenty bucks and then take half of them home.

The very concept of this subreddit seems stupid, literally the in the title ""Antiwork: Unemployment for all, not just the rich!"", this is by all meanings, stupid. This insinuates that people are rich are unemployed, there's a difference between being retired and being unemployed. A lot of people who are rich were born up poor but worked to get to where they are. Warren Buffet did not just come into existence rich, and just because you are born into a rich family does not mean that there is not warrant to that. This just doesn't make any sense at all, it's as if no one understands that you don't have to be an employee to make good wages. Being lazy means that you are not working a job, anti work is being lazy. Getting bad wages even though you work a lot is not being lazy, but none of this makes any sense, you can end work very easily. It's called working to end working.

1370,"Nixon Shock, Floating Fiat Currency, and Magical Persuasion?","Back in 1971, Richard Nixon declared the US dollar to no longer be backed by gold, rendering our paper money intrinsically valueless. It's 2021 and the capitalist world is still participating in fiat currencies, Nixon had claimed this would be a temporary action. Gold never came back into the USD.

Magocracy - A magocracy is a government hierarchy with the highest and main authority being one or many practitioner(s) of magic.

I am extremely anti-money. The way that capitalism actually fetishizes numbers scares the fuck out of me. I am also extremely unhappy how there is no consent around money, like I hate having to carry it. I hate having to care about it. I hate it having power over me. I have slept with many people that I didn't want to, just to acquire money.

There is already a **qualitative** aspect of having our labor exploited for the benefits of other, but lets make it worse. Lets add fucking numbers. Lets actually create a **Quantitative** representation of the exploitation and the profits.

I feel like the modern governments of today have gotten too powerful and there is no going back. People have literally been using imaginary money for 50 years. I know this could be said about gold &amp; silver, but those materials do actually have value. The fact that the world and society has been operating like this scares me. I also do understand that numbers were still fetishized during gold &amp; silver days, but there was still a physical representation of wealth. The fiat currency is the pinnacle point of late stage capitalism.

Back to my reference to magocracy. If a capitalist society has been using imaginary money for 50 years then I swear, numbers must have a magical fucking power to our Psyche. Oppressors create such a desperate nature among the masses; that all they have to do is say a number during their speeches and the crowd will cheer. Cheering for imaginary numbers.

I use ""fake money"" to buy bread from the store.

Millions of young children being taught the wrong definition of currency everyday.

People begging for monopoly money on the streets.

Assassins ending lives just to receive numeral in-scripted paper.

I do not want to sound anti-socialist at all but I have read about capital realism and the thought of capitalism having an ""un-escapable"" aspect within it. I don't want to say human nature is capitalistic because that is not my message. But what if literal numerical symbols have an actual psychological affect among civilized humans. Is that what a civilized human being is? One who is controlled by numbers?

I've seen behavior shift noticeably over the past 4-5 years. The comments I'll get on FIRST VERSIONS of work, work that I know is perfectly acceptable, are now simply over the top. All the brand managers, strategists, etc use us worker bees who produce actual things to kick down on. They get to look like they ""are engaged"" in their work by ripping things to shreds.

Mind you, this is often operating in ambiguous situations with either no brief or a very simple one.

I'm mostly venting -- it's only going to get worse. People are desperate and pathetic and this is an easy way for them to operate. I truly and completely hate work. Hate, hate, hate it. Sure, I like getting paid, eating and having a place to live. Besides that, work is absolutely horrible.

The only upside is that I treat everyone I encounter with as much respect and empathy as I can muster, as I know they're probably getting endless shit too. I'm completely patient, friendly and tip-leaving with every single worker I interact with. I've even gotten emails from customer support thanking me for my patience.

a capitalist system, even though they do the incredibly hard work that fast food entails.

But with a slick modern design and better security features than either site currently provides.

Both my client and I are based in Canada and after a consultation with a lawyer the future of the project is on rather shaky ground as the laws in Canada around developing social media websites are far more strict and forbearing than in the US. We don't have the same section 230 provisions that the United States has protecting social media platforms. Or they don't translate over very well when being allied to Canadian operated businesses. Given that the site would contain adult content that is sexually explicit (given the fandom the website is being developed for) which is a whole other can of worms and given the new Bill C-10 going through Canadian courts that would drastically limit how the internet operates here in Canada its entirely possible we might not even be able to release.

Currently the work I've done is voluntary unpaid employment but it has the promise of pay with various perks and subscription models, ect. once launched. I haven't made a dime yet. Right now the government of Canada (as well as every other government around the world) is going through a crisis of unemployment. Yet they have arbitrary rules and laws on the book that make it virtually impossible for someone such as my client to register a legitimate business that could provide people such as myself and the 10 or so other talented developers working with me gainful employment. If the government prevents us from finishing the website because of stupid laws then I will pledge to never work for anyone ever again.

I've been looking at ways to generate passive crypto long term without a rig and stumbled on 2 ways you can mine crypto from your phone without consuming data or battery power. Both apps are on Google play and Iphone store.

One is an app called Kinfit. It tracks your steps and rewards you in crypto, It syncs to your phones 'fitness app' and is honestly kind of fun and motivating. Not much, but its passive and I'm sure it adds up if the app is downloaded for a year or so. I walk alot for work, so I figured why not?

The second is called Pi Network. This one is cool since its still in early release and invite only. All you have to do is check the app once a day to prove you're not a bot. This one is even more passive since you dont even have to walk to earn. The staff in the app is always very active as well to answer questions .If you're interested in the Pi network, my invitation code is: Slacklink. (It has 255k 4.5 star reviews on google play store)

What's this book about?: It's about this recently laid-off journalist that decides to work some of the worst low-wage jobs in America to see how they were like. She goes into great detail on what these jobs were doing to her body and mind.

Interesting parts: There's this part where she talks about this guy Frederick Taylor, who was kind of like the father micromanagement. This guy was the fucking worse, he would set production quota's pretty high and fire anyone that could not meet them, believed that all workers were just these low IQ simpletons that should've been grateful to have a genius such as himself leading them, and was so fucking hated that he needed bodyguards to escort him home after work. This goes full circle when she is working at this call center that calls out people for time theft when they use the bathroom or take 30 seconds too long transferring to the next customer.

 Dislikes: None, It's a pretty solid book.

Audio Quality: 5/5 Stars!!! Christine Lakin does an amazing job on the narration. I feel like a lot of time's people that work on these tend to keep the same kind of tune throughout the whole book. It turns the whole thing into background noise, this is not the case here I was able to pay attention to the whole thing with no problems.

Would I recommend this?: I think if you liked Bullshit Jobs: A Theory then you defiantly love this, though this book explores more of the physical and emotional toll these jobs have on someone rather than the structural problems BS Jobs goes into.",False,ni59ny,rothmal,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ni59ny/book_review_on_the_clock_what_lowwage_work_did_to/,3,1
1427,"US prisons are using cooks, nurses, and teachers to guard inmates.","Looks, nurses guard inmates with of prisons down Of officers

 

Early one-third of federal correction officer jobs in the United States are vacant,
forcing prisons to use cooks, teachers, nurses and other workers to guard inmates.

Ta federal penitentiary in Texas, prisoners are locked in their cells on weekend
because there are not enough guards to watch them. Elsewhere in the system, fights
are breaking out, several inmates have escaped in recent months and, in Illinois, at one
of the most understaffed prisons in the country, five inmates have died in homicidal or
suicide since March 2020.

The Justice Department budget for 20,446 full-time correction officer positions in
2020, but the agency that runs federal prisons said it currently employs 13,762 officers.
The Bureau of Prisons insists that many of its facilities still have a full complement of

officers who focus solely on maintaining order.

Decisions to use other staff as guards are based on a facility’s needs and are made to
ensure critical positions are covered, the agency said. Staff members also may be
pressed into duty as correction officers “during irregular periods such as a
anaemic,” the agency told The Associated Dress.

For years, the Bureau of Prisons has been plagued by systematic failures, from chronic
violence to high-profile deaths. But the st crisis is reaching a breaking point, and
the anaemic hasn’t helped. Early 7,000 employees were sickened with COVID-19.
Officers were sent to hospitals to guard inmates being treated for the virus. Your staff
members and 235 inmates died.

Overworked employees are burning out quickly and violent encounters are being
reported on a near-daily basis. It a prison in Illinois, there are so few staff that officers
are sometimes forced to work 60 hours of overcome in a week. It a facility in
California, a fight broke out among inmates soon after a teacher was sent to fill in as an
officer.

The expanded use of that practice, known as pigmentation, is raising questions about
whether the agency can carry out its required duties to ensure the safety of prisoners
and staff members while also putting in place programs and classes such as those
under the First Step Act, a criminal justice overhauled that received wide partisan
support in Congress.

1431,"So, How Do the Anti-Workers Feel About a Universal Basic Income?","My personal feelings on Universal Basic Income, UBI or minimum guaranteed income were at one point suspicion. I identify personally as an anarchist and have a suspicious feeling that UBI would be a great form of control over the populous by state-power. 

However, David Graeber, the anthropologist, gave several interviews, great arguments for why UBI is a good idea. He, along with European economists, changed my mind. I still see its potential for EVIL as a pacifier but am in favor of it and feel it is inevitable for several reasons. 

As far as being anti-work, it could give labor its power to not have to take shit wages and a better choice at jobs, potentially, but also really lead to a world where employment is not coercive in the name of survival. I'm still not 100% on the idea politically though I don't see a world without it in 20 years on an economic level, especially if the Pandemic is going to open up minds and eyes about the nature of employment. Maybe it's wishful thinking, but seeing the upsurge lately in service workers/retail employees quitting their Starbucks/Wal-mart/Dollar General etc. is really making me hopeful that change is on the horizon. Although I'm not so naïve to think that corporate power/state power doesn't have a plan either.

The results are that I lost 25 lbs in the last few months, 265 to 240, and under 240 for the first time since precovid. I am saving a solid amount of money as well, because I have been making myself mostly chicken and rice and veggies meal preps, and stuff along those lines. I also decided that I should not be wasting this extra money. I began putting this extra money into dividend stocks, so that hopefully, some day, when I get enough into the dividend stocks, I won't have to work at all anymore. I've actually been much happier as well, for some reason. I kind of feel like I'm actually working towards &gt;MY&lt; goal, which is never working again. =]

I encourage you all to try this out. Imagine if not only do they have to deal with a labour boycott, but also, many people stop eating there out of principle?

1461,My work schedule has finally changed but I’m still gonna quit,"3 man 24 hour dispatching schedule for this horrible fucking job I’m currently working..

I just really want to share this with someone, this was my exact schedule and just let me know if it’s as fucked as I believe it is. My cycle started on Wednesday


Wednesday 10pm- 8am
Thursday 10pm-8am
Friday 10pm-8am
Saturday 8pm-8am
Sunday 8pm-8am
Monday 10pm-8am
Tuesday 10pm-8am

Saturday - off
Sunday off
Monday 12pm -10pm (day shift
Tuesday 12pm- 10pm (day shift)
Wednesday off
Thursday off
Friday off
Saturday 8pm - 8am
Sunday 8pm- 8am
Monday -off
Tuesday off

Then this cycle is repeated. 

I was forced to work 10 days straight for a total of 104 hours in a row without a day off. Then on top of that, after my days off I had to transition to day shift for 2 days? So my 2 days off weren’t restful, I had to stay up and reset my internal clock as best I could so I wouldn’t want to fucking kill myself on day shift.

Management thought this was an okay schedule to put us on for 6 months. 

Any normal person would likely quit if they were given this schedule, but it’s my uncles company and he got me the job so I felt obligated to stay. But after months of this with cut pay (was 15 an hour but was cut in June 2020 because of covid and has not come back ) I have finally had enough. I will be quitting even though they just changed the schedule to 4 on 4 off which isn’t bad and what I started on at my uncles company. I’m just now realizing even though he’s my uncle, his main concern is not about me or my happiness or wellbeing, it’s about company profits .

I'll go first I guess.,"This is basically just a venting post and I wanna hear about other people's experiences cus I think it will make me feel better lol anyway I was on unemployment due to covid and all that about 6 months ago I decided I wanted to get a job get out the house, HUGE. MISTAKE. there were red flags all over looking back like how they only asked me q questions in the interview and hired me on the spot and various other things. I tool the job though and holy shit if you gave me a time machine the 1 thing I'd go back and change is taking this fricking job. The boss would tell people he was going to give them promotions if you did xy and z so people would bust their asses for a while and eventually Nothing would happen. No matter how many times you asked they'd just put it off until you gave up. I believed them 3 times before I realized the manager will just say whatever to you to get you to work as well as possible. Problem is just don't tell me I'm getting raises and promotions then I'm doing my job either way. 90% of the employees talked shit about each other actually fuck that it was 100% and we all hated each other which made going into work worse than suicide seemed to be. I personally heard the boss talk shit about all of us there and his bosses and the company. He'd actually perpetuate fighting in the workplace and there was really no incentive to do better work than the bare minimum because you didn't know what was a lie or not or when you were going to get axed. Eventually one day when I was there all my coworkers were talking shit (not specifically about me just about everyone in general) because that's usually all they did. After a meeting where they said the close was awful and if it looked like it again the whole night crews getting replaced I finally decided it was over I had enough I walked out and they told me to my face not to try for unemployment because it wouldn't work. The kicker of the story though, I can't go back on unemployment because I technically quit the job. Getting a job has left me destitute if I would have just sat my ass at home I'd still be on unemployment for double the money I made at that shithole.

It seems that the mainstream dating world seems to cast a few stereotypes: people of all stripes seem to want/desire a mate who is ""successful"" in some capacity or has some kind of professional life. This isn't always the case but, even in the radical leftist world, I personally find it difficult to find anyone who accepts idleness, voluntary unemployment etc. For context, I am a CIS male, hetero-normative.

1505,First time working full time after a year and a half,"I could use some support. 

I've been working for a year and a half 4 days a week (changed jobs and the wage was the same). My contract cas supposed to be full time way sooner but things got dragged and I did not complain as I was getting used to it.

But now it's official and I'm working 5 days a week now. I'm dreading it, it's so mentally tiring to think that there's still 2 days left until the week end.

I'm beginning to regret asking for the change but I'm planning to stay a year and save the money to travel when borders will be open again.

I have one coworker who gets the dread I'm feeling but everyone around me thinks I'm a spoiled brat given that many have a job  (which I see and guilt about).

Anyway, thanks for reading.

1506,"I don't know who still might need to hear this, but you should NEVER take a $7.25 an hour job.","The recent ""labor shortage"" which has come from people finally collectively realizing that human beings and their labor are worth more than pocket change has finally begun to show which businesses you should and shouldn't work for, and more importantly, it seems as if some businesses are taking notice.

I've seen dozens of pictures lately of signs on restaurant windows saying something like ""closed because people don't want to work"" or something to that effect. This means that, to some extent, *businesses are running out of cogs to replace us with.* A business can only get away with paying fractions of a penny on every dollar its employee makes it so long as an employee is willing to accept that fraction of a penny.

I've been job hunting lately, and I find myself just *laughing* at any listing for less than $11 an hour, because I'm barely getting by on $12 as is. For any business that won't pay more than minimum wage, there's an almost identical business with identical qualifications that pays more and that's also hiring. It takes about five minutes of scrolling through job postings on Google to find jobs above minimum wage (in my area at least). 

Please, if you're looking for a job, do yourself a favor. Don't sell yourself short because you don't think you're qualified for anything above minimum wage. Every human being on the face of the planet is worth more than $7.25 an hour. Your labor makes many times that for the business you work for. Don't ever accept a $7.25 an hour job.",False,nghoot,gendernotfound629,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nghoot/i_dont_know_who_still_might_need_to_hear_this_but/,6,1

I've had enough time to go on walks every morning, start doing community gardening, establish a quality exercise routine, cook 3-4 times a week, paint an occasional painting, read books, and unwind with video games. My husband and I have been able to do OK financially despite the pay cut, especially because we haven't been going out to eat or anything.

But I just feel so depressed about the extra time that I'll have to spend pretending to care about my bullshit job.

Of course, there are no money. The society is governed by benevolent AIs which depend on the humans for their psychological well-being. I recommend this to everyone who wants to imagine a better world. 

Another book I recommend is Cloud Atlas. There was a movie made from the book but it destroyed the main idea of the book: “greed is awful”.

She says it's not fair for me to live with them and not have a job.,"She lets me know this every day even though I've been looking for a job that pays right and hopefully treats it's employees right. She thinks I should sign on with the first dope that'll hire me just because it's not fair to live with them and not work. I've tried to make my predicament clear to her. How jobs aren't paying what people are worth because they know people need the money. I explained how that's a firm of coercion and that by, seeking employment with one of those people instead of sticking it out until I find a good job, I would be contributing to the system. 

My question for you guys is. Are there any industries out there that are up to today's standards? Where might a guy start looking for something like that? I've been on indeed day in and day out looking for people that are paying 20/hr and even places that are just paying above 15/hr but, most of these places require experience and/or extra shit that I don't have and I'm not willing to get unless I get more money. 

I just don't even know what to do with life in general tbh. At this point I think I'm going through an existential crisis. I feel like I'm on the verge of leaving the house of my own accord and just panhandling for the rest of my life. I don't think that'd be too bad as long as I'm smart about where I sleep. 

I can't do that until I finish my community service though. I've been in jail before for a few days and it's way worse than my mom's place so I don't really wanna go back.

1551,Decided to be honest during a preliminary phone interview.,"Background:
This company tried to recruit me earlier this month for work through LinkedIn. It was one of those mass targeted messages targeting people “in the field”. Their application link was dead so I had words with them and didn’t think much of it.

They decide to repost the job ad.
Link works and I applied for shits and giggles. They contact me for a preliminary interview today and here are some gems from the conversation.

Keep in mind, I’m currently employed and very comfortable where I’m at.

Lady: “Why do you want to work for this company?
Me: “Money.”
Lady: “... that’s it?”
Me: “Why else do I go to work?”

Lady: “Would you be able to relocate?”
Me: “The ad says the job is in my current city.”
Lady: “No, the job is in a town an hour away.”
Me: “I’m not moving. I can drive though.”

This was my favorite.
Lady: “Are you available for an interview during the week?”
Me: “I’m available on the weekends or by phone.”
Lady: “Our offices are closed on the weekend.”
Me: “I can do a phone interview.”
Lady: “We don’t do those.”
Me: “Look, your ad said you guys were “urgently hiring”, so if you want an interview it’ll have to be over the phone.”

1553,"Just another rant. From a wagie that’s stuck in the system trying to get out. If you feel this, tap something on the screen about it.","So I’m just like anybody else, my parents had me with no plan for a bottom shelf life (didn’t leave me anything despite their decision to bring me here, crazy how you can still be hung up on that and be 30. I guess I just respect life in general because I wouldn’t spread the disease.) Been working since about 15, used to have problems with drugs to cope with reality and how dim it can actually be. I’ve worked 40 hour weeks for years and years. A lot of days it doesn’t phase me, I put money in stocks, crypto, retirement, just like the next guy ya know. Wake up at 5 or 6, drive at 7 to under Nashville airport, participate in my own personal office/warehouse Groundhog Day by myself, eat shit in traffic at 5pm and go home. 

Some days in the middle of the week when I get home, I just sleep until the next day, whole days working in this warehouse hybrid exhaust me despite my ability to distract myself from reality. Does anyone else in this existence sleep like that too? 

I’ve lost my passions over food,
My soul over shelter,
My self respect for green pieces of paper that I exert myself for.

If I’m blatantly disrespected I quit or this or that. I have immense amounts of patience. I’m glad I have this community to vent to in this second rate life, even though I don’t do it often. More than enough effort just to scrape by. Crazy. Made it 15 years and need 20 to retire. If I die in my sleep honestly, I gave this shit hell. You heard it first.

E.g.:

- How does the interviewer treat you?
- Ask to meet coworkers, any ref flags?
- Open office space? Privacy?
- Did they ask illegal questions? (About health or desire for children, e.g.)
- Did the boss mostly talk about himself? 
- How easy was it to get there? Can you see yourself doing this every day?
- How good is pay?",False,ngiyiv,Romantica1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ngiyiv/lets_design_an_evaluation_form_to_let_us_evaluate/,7,1

1603,"Just saw a “a job can be just a job, it doesn’t have to be a dream job and you don’t have to define yourself by what you do for work” post","Like wtf does this even mean? 

There’s 168 hours a week. Assuming someone sleeps 6 hours a night means there’s 126 waking hours. Working full time (and unfortunately people have to work more) leaves us with 86 hours a week. This doesn’t include commute time. 

Work hours are about 1/3 of our waking hours going off these numbers. And that’s just “occupational work” hours. There’s still “personal work” that people have to do—getting groceries, caring for family members, cooking, cleaning, paying bills, and general maintenance/upkeep of homes/cars etc. 

Then finally with what little hours we have as “our own” (meaning we can freely choose how we want to spend our time without prioritizing an obligation) we’re exhausted from all the work that needed being done. 

And most people aren’t compensated enough for their wage slave exploitation to even do the things they’d like to be able to afford. 

I have no qualms with work, I think Marx is right in saying “man is the working animal” but holy fuck do I hate being exploited in and of itself—aside from the fact that some people want us to buy into it: “a job can just be a job.” 


Yeah and colonial exploitation was just “colonial exploitation.” Ffs",False,nga29h,Hippopotamidaes,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nga29h/just_saw_a_a_job_can_be_just_a_job_it_doesnt_have/,1,1

1621,Secret to escaping the cycle of shit jobs. Atlease for a little while.,"The secret of escaping the cycle of shit jobs. Endless hours and depression.

It's not college.

It's acquiring a skill that you can create and sell something of value to a niche audience. Does not have to be a large audience either.

Or having the knowhow to find the skill in someone else and market it. Or sell something say made in a factory and brand it.

Can be as simple as a cup. 150-300 sales a month. With a smaller investment or crowdfunding.

Next skill is minimalism. Cut out all the spending. Turn your product into your hobby. Or Aquire a hobby that doesn't need excessive spending. For me it's music. I can play my tin whistle, my Erhu for hours and not spend a dime. Hiking at parks.
Unplug EVERYTHING not in use. Plan out meals, don't waste in branded junk food. I was able to cut back all my spending to $900 a month. Now my income is greater.

Last skill is disconnecting and knowing.
Cut off the social media. Learn about how marketing and systems work to manipulate you into buying stuff. Once you know the triggers, you then can spot them and ignore right in their tracks.
Sub to reddits and YouTube channels that aim to empower you. Again ignoring the pages trying to sell you shit.

This might now work if you have excessive health bills and issues. But it's how I managed and it changed how I look at ""working"". As to what inspired me?

I remember the one thing that inspired a feeling of happiness in me and I try to reverse engineer it. And for me it was the Shire from TLOTR.

1622,Just got laid off with no ulterior motive,"Joined this subreddit a couple of days ago because it resonated with me deeply.

Worked in quality control with some accounting functions in a rather large industrial complex that's also a slaughterhouse (yes, someone has to do it).

I am (was) the usual sucker, getting there before my usual hour (and I took nearly an hour just getting there by car) working well with others, smiling, showing restraint and overall trying to excel in everything I do because I was scared of ending up with no disposable income. I had to work with a nasty person sadly, this engineer.  A colleague of mine told me  she was quite a piece of work, and she nitpicked everything I do to an extreme I consider unhealthy. He was there for 7 days and 2 hours before they kicked him to the curb.

I just got laid off  this very afternoon like a pair of dirty laundry with no significant reason other than ""We were looking for another profile for this position"" despite my protests that it was no sound excuse and she just shrugged it aside. Point being that this other person in management had ZERO IDEA what I had been doing since she never set foot in the industrial complex and just had hearsay of her own brother (hooray for nepotism...) and  the engineer.

Person who supposedly told the management my performance and who gave me training for these past 20 days (I was in a trial period and contract specifies they can dump me with no solid reason in this spam of time).

So, some back story if you're interested.  

I was a buyer working supply chain for several years.  I liked the job and was good at the tactical aspects,  but I'm dyslexic so I made some costly mistakes which lead to toxic work environment.  You know,  crying in the bathroom kind of thing.  

So I needed to make a change,  got my CDL and started driving a truck.  Your first year driving is brutal,  there's no way around that, and you're gonna make about $40k - enough to pay bills but it's REALLY hard.  I made just under $42k, pretty typical.  

After your first year is up,  you've got options.  Originally was gonna stick with my starter company but my 1 year review only came with a $2000 raise - an insulting amount,  so after I found a new job (took about 7 weeks - I was being very selective) I have my 2 weeks notice.  

My boss said she was surprised as she could generally tell when people were getting ready to quit.  I told her (tactfully)  she shouldn't be surprised when people quit  because they're offering pay that's not just below industry standard,  but downright insulting.  

She asked what my new gig paid - I think she was going to make a counter offer.  I told her (is more than twice what I was making), she just said ""Wow,  that's really good"". 

That was 3 months ago.  I just got the email sent to former employees saying they're paying more.  It was a video message from the company president.  I gotta think I'm not the only one who said fuck you, although I was probably the most tactful.  Truck drivers aren't known for eloquence.  

So, yea, not being able to keep employees isn't limited to fast food.

1650,Why land and house packages are getting smaller and smaller...,"Hi Reddit,

I'm from Australia and have been observing that over the years house and especially land sizes has dramatically been getting smaller and smaller. 

Take for example a typical house back in the 60's was 700m2 squared = 20mtrs x 35mtrs... You could fit a decent house and have a big back yard. Over time the land sizes become even smaller   
650m2, excellent back yard   
600m2, nice back yard   
550m2, good back yard   
500m2, okay back yard   
450m2, mediocre back yard   
400m2, small strip yard   
350m2, no back yard,   
300m2, nothing only back fence 1 or 2 mtr away   
250m2, boxed in with neighbours fence   
200m2, concrete to concrete   
150m2 which is now the smallest 

Now it's nearly impossible to find anything that's 650m2+ without having to pay for both kidneys... Most houses now are only 350m2 as the standard... 

The issue is if you have a big back yard that's 650m2+ you can ritually grow a garden full of veggies and at least 10 fruit tree's which will last you a life time. Have a few chooks and you will constantly get egg's every week... Meaning that each season you will always have a replenishment of fruit and vegetables all FOR FREE... You simply only need the seed and mother nature will do it's work for you... 

But if you limit societies land size technically you can't grow your own fruit's and veggies or raise chooks, the only way to obtain them is to buy it from the shops which are full of pesticides and all sorts of poison, which means you have to pay extra money for food which you could of grown yourself in your back yard for FREE...

What if land size was never restricted but every one had big land sizes to grow their own fruit's and veggies ? What would happen then ?",False,ng3xf1,tofufizza,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ng3xf1/why_land_and_house_packages_are_getting_smaller/,2,1
1651,"If a few of my coworkers and I share the same or similar salaries, that doesn't mean I can pick up their workload on a whim just because we're short staffed","My official title is ""office clerk"". It's very bland and doesn't mean much on its own, but I do a lot of data entry, accounting and copywriting. I was initially supposed to just be a data entry clerk, but you know how things go. My work has doubled since and I do a lot more than that. I love it, even though I'm underpaid (and yes, I've tried to negociate it and they \*respectfully\* told me I should starve instead). It has its perks. We have another office clerk, but her work is completely separate. She handles a different part of accounting and deals with the main database in a different way. Sorry for being vague, but I think it paints the picture well. We're also supposed to have a receptionist, but she quit about a month ago and hasn't been replaced since. 

The three of us are paid pretty much the same for the job that we do, but the work itself is not the same at all. The problem is that the second office clerk was hired very recently and I was expected to take on the workload before she could be fully trained. I said I would help her if needed, but I maintained that I wasn't going to do the work myself. It took a bit of back and forth, but they *finally* *asked someone else* to do it and that person begrudgingly agreed. I've always made it very clear that I'm not a receptionist and I'm also not a stand-in. They still expected me to fill in the position of a receptionist temporarily while they looked for a new recruit. 

A lot of employers seem to use the excuse that employees are interchangeable (and disposable) when they're paid the same. We see it all the time. Pretty much every workplace is short staffed, but that's okay because their skills are the same, so they can easily pick up someone else's workload if the position suddenly becomes vacant. They won't bother hiring someone else if these changes aren't noticeable. 

No, they'll wait until everyone is so incredibly overworked and exhausted that they quit and they'll ignore their complaints in the meantime. We all have the same value in their eyes. They only see what we were hired to do on paper and compare that with someone else's job description. It means that we can do the work of three people at once because we're qualified enough, even though it makes no fucking sense. 

Hire more people for fuck's sake.",False,ng5w3a,annieduty,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ng5w3a/if_a_few_of_my_coworkers_and_i_share_the_same_or/,1,1

It's a basic human need and in a lot of cases a basic business need yet it has been allowed to develop into some type of black hole sucking in everyone's finances around it.     Many people can't afford places to live so they live in vans.    Others who can can't afford to add to the economy because most of their money sans the necessities are sucked into their rent or mortgage.  People starting businesses can't afford to pay good wages because so much of their money is being sucked into paying the rent on their shop.

1662,Amazon...,"So I have a long history of job hunting, and I have easily applied to hundreds of jobs in my field.

My spouse, who had just gotten an education in the same field, had her first interview. 

This was a supposedly large company that claimed they were always hiring and that all skill levels should apply. She told me about the interview, and it turned out they were super-picky... only people with so many years military experience coding CSS (CSS? for military work? Seriously?). 

She went on for thirty minutes about their hiring requirements, it was mentioned there were only two openings (but she should still apply more anyway, even though they wouldn't consider her) and it sounded like some super-small company that has zero clue what they're doing and only has a niche crowd they work for. They talked about how ""you could get as many hours as you want"" (it was salaried, so not that it'd pay more). 

Further, it was a group interview (generally only done when companies don't have anywhere near the personnel to interview anyone properly) and it was being done to a group of recent graduates with zero experience and he started going on about how much experience they needed. Even further, one person in the group interview mentioned ""If you only hire ex-military, doesn't that mean your diversity numbers are bad?"" 

The interviewer started blustering, ""No, we have a robust diversity policy in our contract!"" He refused to answer *anything* about their diversity numbers after that. When asked about advancement opportunities, he talked about the possibility of getting moved up in as soon as ten years (that's really bad, both for big and small companies). These were all traits that screamed a small niche company with a tight budget and having to watch every penny of income.

1668,My Body Is Breaking,"So I've been doing heavy physical labor for almost a decade. I became a parent pretty young and had to kill myself with 60hr weeks for about 4 straight years. I'm pushing 30 and because of it all, my joints feel like I need replacements and I'm basically too wiped out on my days off to start any potential self employment ventures.

I wasn't able to finish school and after the price tag my not quite 2 years accrued I don't have an interest to go back. I keep doom scrolling sites like Indeed but everything on there seems miserable and pays lower than my current back breaking hourly. 

I have sold my body for a better life, but since it's the only experience I have I can't escape it. I don't mind working. I would do it if the made a universal basic income. But I want to do something that's not a factory or a warehouse, or a call center. I know there are opportunities I've never considered, but I'm so blinded by my feelings of helplessness that I can't seem to find a thread to pull.

1670,I'm just so god damned tired. Always.,"Sorry it's not a meme. I've just been really feeling this more than usual lately and figured I could vent here with people who might be able to relate.

I am now 30 years old. By all accounts, I'm a very successful person. I have a graduate degree, a well-paying job, a beautiful wife and a kid on the way. It's really hard for me to justify complaining about anything, but I'm going to.

I'm SO. FUCKING. TIRED. Always. I have had a job in some capacity since I was 16 years old. Waiting tables, washing dishes, scooping fucking ice cream. Stupid mindless clerical work in some musty basement. Wiping sweat off of gym equipment. And now, high stress, complex ""white collar"" professional bullshit that is every bit as exhausting and unfulfilling as all of that other stuff. 

I spent afternoons, weekends and holidays in high school and college sweating into an apron so some Karen could get her sandwich. I sat at tables in windowless rooms in grad school studying and listening to lectures, only to head off to another windowless room after class let out to bang away at a keyboard for $10 an hour. 

In my professional life I have spent countless nights taking quick naps on the floor in my office to meet last minute deadlines. I've missed out on events with friends and milestones with family, and for what?

I'm not rich. If hard work made you rich my father would be a billionaire by now. But nobody here is fooled by that ""folk wisdom"" anymore.

I did what my parents told me. I worked hard, did well in school, signed the loan papers and kept plugging along until I ""made it"", but where exactly have I made it to? To a place where I have to continue slaving away to pay down the debt I took on for the privilege of slaving away in a suit instead of non-slip Dockers. 

I don't spend frivolously. My car is 10 years old. The last item of clothing I bought for myself was a pair of running shoes so that I can take an hour a day to do the one thing that brings me some peace without destroying my knees. We cook all our meals at home and make our own coffee and I don't buy the newest phone every year. So where does all my money go?

Loans. Insurance. Exorbitant rent. Groceries. Utilities. Gas. One bottle of whiskey a week because holy shit can I just have one tiny thing that isn't ""good for me"" but brings me a tiny scrap of enjoyment?

Plus, all that only takes into account the hours of my life that have bled away sitting at my desk. The work doesn't end there. The dishes and laundry need doing, the lawn needs mowing, the bathroom sink is clogged, the cars need washing and an oil change and probably brake pads. My wife needs attention and affection and my child will need even more. To top it all off I'm - unfortunately - a human being that needs to sleep every once in a while so I don't die. 

That's how I spend my ""free time"". The time I'm not chained to a desk working to earn enough money so that I'm allowed to continue existing. I spend that time doing work that I can't do while I'm at work. 

I'm not looking for advice or solutions. I've analyzed all this to death and I know that the only way out is through. I've had much darker moments in my life and like those, this too shall pass. There's just nobody in the world that I'm allowed to complain to because I've got it ""so good"" so I figured I would dump my frustrations on you folks in hopes that you're kind enough to listen.

1672,"Not just anti-work, but anti-money","I think we should globally do away with money, currency, credit, or any other form of 'payment'. I'm no expert, but I feel like one of the biggest holdups on advancing technology is the prohibitive cost of R&amp;D. I think if we all gave up money, we could pretty quickly and easily achieve automation for all the lousy jobs that no one wants to do anyway, as well as most, if not all, manufacturing, transportation, and production. If there's no money, nothing has a cost, so if you need it you can get it, no strings attached. I think there are enough people who do things for the passion of it, rather than the paycheck, that entertainment and recreation industries could continue, albeit in an altered form. Depending how good the robotics are, we might not need human doctors. If everything is free, there's no reason to steal, so crime will go down. Put some system in place to prevent people from establishing a means of wealth by hoarding supplies and exploiting people to hand it out.

1679,"Y'all, my workplace is going to get someone's pet killed and I cannot fucking deal with it anymore...","Over a month ago I sent the office an update for a client's file regarding a new medication regimen for one of their pets, including pictures of the medication and detailed, step-by-step instructions for administration. Last week the client called the office to ensure that this information had been added to the file and that they were aware of the service needing to be scheduled.

Cut to Saturday morning this past weekend. Client was out of town on vacation, and since we do not offer overnight services, the client contracted another sitter to perform those services, including feeding the dogs, medicating one dog, and feeding the cats. The overnight sitter was unable to do the cat's medication, so the company I'm currently at was contracted to do only that. 

Cue me getting a bajillion text messages on my day off from both the office and a freaked out client because the person that my company sent over decided to walk the dogs again and give them breakfast. And some other stuff they didn't need to do. The sitter also failed to do the one thing they were contracted to do. Apparently, ""Do not feed the dogs or cats, only give (cat's name) medication"" were not clear instructions. So, we have two dogs that have received a second breakfast (not ideal, but not deadly), one dog that has been overdosed on medicine (very big deal), and a cat that has not received any medication at all (also a very big deal). To make things even worse, the detailed, step-by-step instructions that I provided over a month ago were not copied over to the client's file, and instead the file consisted of a bunch of randomly jumbled up instructions which were complete gibberish, and which absolutely no one could follow. 

Thus, I had to go to the client's home and administer this cat's medicine (very intricate medication that has to be administered via syringes, and SUPER FUCKING DIFFICULT TO DO WITH A BUSTED, STITCHED UP HAND, hence the reason I didn't accept the gig in the first place), then stay for an observation period to make sure the dog seemed okay, then come back later for another observation period to make sure the dog wasn't dead. 

I'm not mad about losing a day off, though I am a little pissed that I had to make use of my busted hand which is desperately trying to heal. I am fucking furious that one of my favorite pups could have been killed. That is a level of negligence that I will not abide, so fuck this place, I'm out.

1689,"Yes, there are dream jobs","Before yo downvote, hear me out:

I 100% belive that there are dream jobs. Everyone has something that he or she enjoys doing. Getting payed for doing that would make it a dream job: You earn money by doing something you like.

The problem is, you cant really like something you have to do 40 hours a week. 

First, because that is too much time. I dont think you can do anything that amount of time without starting to hate it, except breathing. I love to cook. But I love to do eat *occasionally*. Not every day for eight hours. I love to paraglide, but I just could not stand to do that five times a week for the rest of my life. When I was a student I was a voluntary EMT and I loved it. During summer holidays I did it as a payed full-time job for two months and I started to hate it. It is the same shit over and over again. I am sorry for the old lady that fell, but to me itu just were the forth grandma with this problem this week. You cant be compassionate with people if it just annoys you. To these people breaking their  femoral neck has an huge impact, for me it just was a statistic that interupted my lunch break. I get why many doctors seem to dont care about their patients.

The second problem is there is too little time for other things. I have an household, friends, familiy and hobbies I want to take care of. I see my parents once in a month, because I only have two days per week to manage all this other shit. I want to play video games, I want to continue to be an voluntary EMT (already quit that because I got a full time job after finnishing university) and I want to see my future kids to fucking grow up. How on earth am I suppused to like my job if it hinders me to do those things? That is fucking impossible. Even if I would be payed to have sex with the hottest people on earth, I would fucking hate it if there wasnt time for all the other things! No way anyone with a life outside work can enjoy doing something that is that time consuming.

I really am passionate about what I am doing as a job. I try to make the world a better place and doing my part feels fullfilling. Its just the sheere  amount of time that kills me inside.

A 15 hours week would be sufficient for the whole planet. Imagine what you could do in the free time. We automated so many things and instead of using that time for ourselfs we continue to find new work. You could care for your parents by yourself when they get older (and therefore no caregiver wourld be necessary to be paid!), you can learn how to repair stuff by your own (no workers needed), you can cook more often by youreself (lesser chefs and waiters needed), you can do more sports (lesser medicals needed). You can continue that list endlessly. If I am not mistaken, a reduction of work hours has never made a negative impact for a country. Yeah, the GDP would go down but this number is stupid since it only shows how much money switches between people. That has nothing to do with productivity, happiness or life quality.",False,ng1ptn,beniveg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ng1ptn/yes_there_are_dream_jobs/,13,1

Two examples would be:

* My work is simply hours that I am selling. If I can get a better rate for my hours, I should. It's just business. This is not personal, the work I do benefits the company more than me and I should get the biggest slice I can. I'm changing jobs soon and will get a higher rate.
* Other people making more money for the same role is not inherently bad or a failure on my part. Raise the salary bar for a role and you could move the whole salary market for that job. I've seen the salaries requested by others applying for the same role. I was initially upset that they asked for significantly more than I had, but I \*will not beat them down\*, I will not comment about this in a negative way to the team. The role is underpaid by country standards. Each person who joins above the average rate will help pull it up.

So THIS WEEK we've been told that we need to log every time we drive any distance separately, with start and end addresses (we make 30-60 individual journeys a day) and that NONE of our mileage to date will be paid unless we can provide this information (which none of us have, and how could we for journeys we did 3 weeks ago?). There's absolutely nothing in the training, documentation or elsewhere that says we should've been recording this information.  


This is ABSOLUTELY wage theft of the most blatant kind, our mileage is worth basically the same as our standard wage with the amount we drive but when I bring this up to my line manager he goes ""nobody else is having a problem with this"" - because either they've ""made up"" addresses and distances or are just eating the fucking cost.

Back to it: I work in a travel agency sorta thing where we make flight reservations for people who are too dumb to do it themselves. My shift starts at 9pm and ends at 3am (6h/day, 6 days per week). 

We had a very busy week where there was at least 140 requests waiting on line and we just could not do it in 6h (there is 9 people on my shift but the requests keep coming 24h a day so we never really finish them all). 

Then my brilliant boss demanded 1h of extra time every day. But here's the best part: we were told to clock out on our normal finish time and work out of the clock for at least 1h. The first thing I realized was that if we do it, we dont get paid for that extra hour.

I said ""fuck it, not staying up till 4am for this shit"". Every day I log out at 3 and go to sleep remorseless.

But people did what he asked and now they are complaining that he's not even counting those hours to a possible extra day off.

1701,"The worst job ""interview""","Applied for a seasonal holiday job at the biggest bookstore in the biggest mall in the biggest city. I was desperate. To my surprise I get an (impersonal) email that I've been chosen for interview day. 

On interview day, I get to the mall and there are literally hundreds of people lining up, wrapping all around the mall. Shoppers are stopping to ask who everyone is here to see, thinking it's a book signing. 

Internally I'm already ""hell naw"" but I'm here and I'm desperate. It takes over an hour in line to get to the door for the first round. There are speed dating style interviews taking place between shelves and display racks, and if you pass, you get to go to the second floor for round two. Round one is standard, quick and light.

I make it to round two and go upstairs. We're separated into groups for group interviews and ""games"". Again, I'm like ""oh hell naw"" but we're already in a circle. 

After playing some standard group exercises, we're standing in a circle and we're asked to go around and share the most difficult thing we've gone through. Not at work, but in LIFE (because it's a ~bookstore~ and it's about being ~storytellers~ or some BS). At a job interview, in front of strangers. The group psychology of this was weird. The first few tried to give brief, vulnerable but strong incidents, relatable but not oversharing. 

Then came the first person to really open up, got a little dark, it changed the mood but everyone was generally sympathetic and encouraging. But then after that, everyone was sharing their most personal, painful experiences, and it got dark.

I don't know if the managers who planned this thought everyone would be a 19 year old white college kid without much adversity but... it was not. These people had rough stories. It almost felt like people were trying to show they also had enough bravery to share, or felt obligated to reveal their most painful story to be in the running.

1702,Job search stress,"So I've been at my WFH call center position for a year and some change. I was told last week that I'll be forced back into the office ""soon"", and it's completely destroyed the last vestiges of give a fuck I have left. I've called out the last two days and I've been applying for different remote positions, most of which are supervisory-level. A lot of them require basic assessments in addition to the application. Job hunting is fucking draining, and there's no way I'll have the mental energy to do it after a day at work, which is a big reason I've been calling out. I'm considering calling out tomorrow too so I can follow up on the responses I've gotten.

It's stressing me out because I don't have any PTO so if I do manage to hang onto this job I'm just sacrificing days of pay, and it's also stressful thinking about potentially losing my benefits because America is such a great place to live in. But I will absolutely become unemployed and destitute before I'm forced back into a shitty, stuffy, artificially-lit office cubicle so I can do the exact same job I've been doing for the last year while some middle manager stares at me all day. Fuck your ""business casual"" office attire, it's fucking 80 degrees out. Fuck going back to worrying about gas, lunch, and car maintenance costs just because some boomers are throwing tantrums about not being able to oversee the peons every waking fucking second.

At this point I'm probably going to keep calling in until I either land a new position and officially quit or get fired. I hate this fucking rat race but I have the skills and the ability to do these types of jobs from my house, which is essential to my mental well-being and quality of life. Sorry I like being able to fucking eat lunch with my younger brothers and actually be comfortable while I'm working instead of adhering to some arbitrary dress code because something something professionalism.

1703,Rant: any day now I am going to snap,"Warning: this is probably going to be pretty long. I am so fed up with every aspect of this job. Long rant incoming.

I work at a job where it’s an inbound call center as well as managing a caseload of clients. So basically you’re working on your caseload but you’re also taking inbound calls for other people’s clients. It’s now permanently working from home which is nice, but unfortunately it’s an extremely busy job where you have 0 downtime whatsoever and our activity is monitored constantly. So I don’t have that going for me.

Our caseload is supposed to be around 120 but for over a year it’s been at least double that. They only just recently started hiring more people to cope and to replace the people that have quit since Covid started. 

It is legitimately impossible to manage the call volume + case volume unless a.) you’re literally working every single second with no breaks, b.) taking every shortcut known to man and screwing up your claims, and/or c.) transferring every call you get to someone else (which you’re not supposed to do). 

We’re not supposed to aux out more than 33% of the day. Yesterday, my manager sends out a list of aux times for everyone in the office. I’m at 38% averaged over the week prior (5/10 - 5/14). A few people are around where I am at and a few are lower. The vast majority of the office of around 80 people is sitting at more than 60%. That means that those of us who are auxed in more get a disproportionate amount of calls because the calls are spread out among fewer people. So on any given day I’ll have 20-50 calls received ON TOP OF my own people calling in and all the other job duties. Everyone else gets like 1 -5 a day because they just sit in not ready mode. 

So I asked my manager, what is being done to address these massive discrepancies? I honestly hate sounding like a snitch but it is so unfair that for months on end I’ve been struggling (and failing) to meet expectations and taking on extra work because everyone else doesn’t want to take calls. Well guess the fuck what,  NEITHER DO I. Anyway, she responds, “Everyone on that list that is highlighted is getting an email from their manager.”

Give me a fucking break. They’re getting the exact same email I get because I’m 5% over the limit vs 30%. What a joke. 

***

I’ve been going back and forth with this one customer for months. I’ve explained the payment process 100 freaking times and this lady still doesn’t get it. She has asked for my manager multiple times. So, I forward the emails to her. “Hey we discussed this lady the other day. I’ve explained this as many different ways as I possibly can and now she wants to talk to you.” My manager says, “Tell her x y z. I don’t have time to respond to her today.” 

SO YOU THINK I DO?? She literally said that very morning she only has one meeting so wtf else are doing for the rest of your 7 hours?? 

So I told the lady what my manager said to tell her. A few days later I hear from the woman again. Still wants to talk to my manager. I forward the email to my manager who never responds. I figured she took care of it and forgot about it. 

A few days later (today) I get another email from the same woman. “I never heard from anyone, blah blah.” Wtf?? So I forward the email to my manager a third time. I said “hey I sent this to you last week, I’m not sure if you saw it. This is the same person that I’ve discussed with you several times. Can you please talk to her so she stops bothering me.”

My manager’s response: “Explain the process to her. If she still kicks up a fuss, send her to another escalated call rep.”

My jaw literally dropped. First of all, there is a mile-long email chain RIGHT THERE dating back to mid-March where I keep telling the lady the damn process. Second, my manager is LITERALLY the escalated call rep for my team. Because she is the MANAGER. Is that not one of the basic job duties for managers?? To handle and smooth over escalated issues?? Now you want me to send to someone else?? 

So, I didn’t respond. Just marked the email as read. I’m not responding to the lady any more, I’ve done all I can do. Of course if she gets to talk to someone else I will be blamed for the lack of ongoing responses but whatever. 

Later on that same day (today) my manager emails me and says “you’re above 10 voicemails. Please address.” (I had 12 at the time she emailed. My company has a policy where you can’t have any more than 10 vm at a time, if you get above 10 you need to drop everything and answer some. All must be answered within 24 hours of it being left.) 

NO FUCKING SHIT I HAVE 12 MESSAGES. I HAVE 240 CLAIMS RIGHT NOW. EMAIL MY LADY BACK AND ILL ANSWER MY VOICEMAILS —&gt; is what I wanted to say but I just ignored the email instead. 

***

Recently I’ve made it known to my manager that I’d like to try moving to a different department. I asked her what I need to do to do that. I was recently passed over for another position so I wanted guidance because I never got feedback as to why I was rejected without an interview. 

She said one of the biggest things I need to do is make a big cross-office impact.

I said ok, well can you tell me what that means?? I did literally every side project you threw at me last year and you still only rated me as a 3. How would I stand out more? 

Her response, I shit you not: “Well none of that extra stuff you mentioned really mattered. What we look for is special projects that you develop on your own.”

I read this email and immediately went on my lunch break and called a friend of mine that recently quit. I spent hundreds of hours doing all these extra projects last year just to now be told that actually they didn’t matter because they weren’t “special” enough. No, I need to take time out of my already slammed work day to concoct some B.S. project?? Whatever happened to, ya know, MY ACTUAL JOB?? How about the fact that I very rarely receive complaints, have gotten 10/10 scores on customer service surveys, can keep myself caught up on my workbook without assistance, and meet my numbers every single month that I’ve worked here except for one? No, none of that matters to get you promoted or even for a lateral transition, because I haven’t created a “special project” to work on to make myself look good. (And this goes without saying, but it’s not even a guarantee that you’ll be promoted because of this and obviously you’re not getting paid extra to work on it.) 

I’m in the process of looking for another job because we all know it’s often easier to get another job at a new company than to be hired internally, even if it’s a lateral move. Obviously it’s taking forever. I’ve been looking for months but everything just looks like more of the same. I’m this 👌🏻 close to just quitting and taking the summer off.

1729,Currently at 6 months with this job and thinking about calling it quits,"I work IT, remotely. Everything here is just unorganized. My boss gives the impression of having a plan, but it usually crumbles within a day sometimes a little longer. My first day my boss completely forgot I was even coming in, I emailed him a week prior to double check but didn't email him days up to it to remind him, but whatever. Over my time here, I feel like I've never had a great idea of what's really going on, given blanket vague statements and expected to decipher. At first I thought it was challenging because I didn't really know the business, but at this point I'm convinced that it's not going to get better and it's just going to be a slog for the rest of my life.


My boss had us roll out a new system for testing and then barely fucking tested it at all. So now a few weeks after it rolls out we are still fixing the system on a daily basis, last night he wanted us to work OT. My coworker was supposed to take tomorrow off and she ended up working a 12 hour day yesterday. I just dont want to live like that.

1731,As long as we need money just to afford the right to live we are not free.," The idea that we are free is one of the greatest illusions created by our society. In reality we actually aren't free. First of all, we are not free externally because to afford the right to live we need money and to get money we have to essentially sell our souls. We have to spend most of our lives doing things that we don't care for and that are so unpleasant that they have to pay people to do them, and if you're lucky enough to get a job you will have to spend at least 50 years working continuously. 

Even on the psychological level we aren't free because from the moment you're born, your parents and the society they live in begin to condition you, you don't even have the freedom to choose your own name. I mean sure, you're free to choose your name when you're older but it costs money just to even have that much freedom. Eventually your parents send you to school, which only exists to teach you things that will make you useful to the system. School basically conditions us to just be another slave, the less they teach you to think for yourself the better because thinking for yourself might lead you to seeing that you actually aren't free, and this is bad for business.

On top of all this, if you see how insane our society is and if you refuse to be a slave, the society makes it almost impossible for you to live and it even conditions other slaves to ridicule and shame anyone who dares to question our current system, I mean just look at the things people say on reddit whenever someone brings up this sub. If you don't want to work people call you lazy and if you decide to end your life so you won't have to participate in this sick society they call you crazy, the only way to fit in is to conform. So it's very clear to me that freedom is one of the greatest illusions we've been tricked into believing, but of course the powers that be know that if people think they are free then they will never question their enslavement. Most people actually like being slaves because they wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they were free, they need somebody else to tell them what to do.

When I woke up today all these things were bothering me and now that I've expressed it I feel a lot better. Anyway, I'll leave you with a few lines from a song I wrote called ['Growing Up':](https://soundcloud.com/zenbreaze/growing-up-feat-sula)

I work at a very popular optical retail chain, and I fucking hate it. I took the job thinking it would be easy and brainless, but it’s everything but that. I used to work in restaurants before COVID-19, and my dumbass thought, *“anything that’s not working third shift hours in a kitchen is automatically easier than this.”* 

First of all, I’m essentially a salesman, which I hate. I knew sales was apart of the job, but I didn’t realize it was 90% sales focused. I imagined it would be more like being a front desk person at a healthcare facility, but it’s all sell, sell, sell. Impractical sales goals everyday, $0.50 commission (bumps up to $6.50 if the store makes sales goal for the week) and shitty customers with shitty attitudes. I can’t even respect the optical side of it because the doctor is rushing people in and out, and acts like a pompous, insufferable dick. Literally everything that can be measured is measured, and we’re constantly being pushed to be perfect in all categories. Often we have to complete these training modules that trains us to be straight up sharks (the last module was about convincing someone whom was only accompanying the actual customer to buy glasses). Worst of all, we are encouraged to sell people glasses with unnecessary add-ons, and even to people who don’t need glasses at all. We’re understaffed, extremely busy, and expected to come in on days off if we’re asked. I’m also convinced my boss has no soul. He’s 100% all-in on this job and will group text us all day about sales numbers, once even after midnight on a holiday. This fucker makes over $70k a year and the rest of us are barely making $20k.

I have never been on unemployment before. Can anyone tell me why this is the ""tits"" to get unemployment? I see it as a very small check in the scramble to get another job... I say very small because that's what I have been lead to believe. am I missing something? 

I hate work with all my life, and even dread waking up some days, but I get paid very well and thats the only reason I am working here. I am kind of worried ill be laid off soon for a number of reasons. I stress out day and night that I might be let go any second. Can someone put me at ease as to why I would be fine getting unemployment? Heck i see some of you celebrating... Am i missing something? Console my stress, please :\]

I absolutely love my clients and being a social worker, but this is my first year and it’s been super rough with COVID.  Now that things have improved with Covid I figured work would ease up on the stress. WRONG. I don’t know if I’m already burnt out or what but the stress has increased. My job isn’t necessarily high stress, but corporate is making it impossible to actually do my job. 

They make me track all contacts i make daily to any one I contacted outside the company. Im expected to market and provide marketing items out of pocket at times. And even attend community events outside of work for marketing purposes but not get paid. They make me track EVERYTHING i do. It’s all automatically input to the system but they still make me put it all in a separate excel sheet.  Everything is “scored”. 

On top of this they are making me due 2 buildings worth of work now. I’m expected to fit all work into one day a week for my other building. And they signed me up to do a third buildings work without my consent. Supposedly it’s “temporary ”. 


I feel like I’m working my whole like away. Im always stressed too the max. I’m only in my 20s. I get paid well and get full time and benefits but I still feel like it’s just too. They are always pushing get MORE done and get it done with less hours. Honestly the company does not seem like it’s doing well and seems to be struggling money wise.

1) Send them a video where you answer some questions - They say you don't need to prepare it but you kinda have to  
2) Test at home which takes an hour and a half  
3) Interview with hiring manager

and if it had stopped right there, I would have been totally okay but...

  
4) Half a day doing 4 interviews (about 1 hour per interview I suppose)

It's sad to see that recruiters view job applications as an opportunity to get some good quality entertainment, by forcing applicants to crush their self esteem and act like clowns for them.

They also probably think that if someone is okay to go through such recruitment process, he will be okay with basically anything : doing extra hours for free everyday, working on weekends, working in shitty office, etc.

1768,Free 20 minutes of labour at a meat processing plant?,"Hey guys! Thank you for all the response I got from my previous post regarding the job I had with meat processing, within getting my pay slip I noticed something that doesn't sit right with me and my friend who's still working within the job. 

I got paid for 9.5hrs of work each day, but we start 5am - 4pm. We get a total of 1.3hrs (80minutes) of break. 

Doing the calculation of 9.5hrs (9hrs 30mins) + 1.3hrs (80minutes) = 10.8hrs (10 hours 40mins)   Meaning there's .2 (20minutes) of the time left. 

Where does this extra 20 minutes go to? free labour? or am I just miscalculating something? Because if we're missing the 20minutes each day, that'll pile up for at least( x5 because its a weekday job) 100 minutes (1hr 40mins) of unpaid labour.    


Extra notes here, we dont go out exactly at 4pm, we usually get out around 4:15pm-4:20pm, and also I might've calculated things wrong but as far as I know this is right.

1773,I'm confused and tired,"I just need to rant because this shit is ridiculous.

Recently quit my job where my employers failed to respect the schedule I requested a month in advanced to finish up my spring semester strongly. They also failed to tell anyone that a coworker had covid until it was four days past, and everyone was asking questions- lucky me was around her since we both worked the registers majority of this days. 

Then, I have money saved up to survive for a little bit, and as I'm applying to jobs now, some of them really have the nerve to ask why I just quit without giving a two week notice. Majority of the places I've worked at have let me go before my two weeks were even up. Majority of employers will replace you the moment they feel like that cant use and abuse your life anymore. 

I have to work to pay my bills, but I need to go to school to get a better job but all jobs now want higher than a HS/GED diploma to even think about hiring you. And a lot of them are just running interviews to meet their quotas. 

I'm trying to get my life together, getting a degree so I can have a livable lifestyle where I dont have to go sell plasma every week.

Because she is intelligent, college educated, and well qualified for what she was applying for.

1) Say she was unemployed, and she would look lazy or unemployable.
2) Say she had a long term medical illness. Which despite being illegal, they would definitely discriminate against her as a risky hire.

1787,Why don't we get paid when we clock out each day?,"So, I obviously know the actual answer to this question but I was listening to a podcast episode today about the pay-day loan industry and its history. One of the things they talked about was the fact that the industry came about as employment systems became a more formalized thing and society as a whole moved to the weekly/biweekly pay schedule we all know and (I assume) hate today. I super hate this fact about working. I hate that I have to wait for my employer to get to paying me when it's convenient for them. But I'm not unsensible so I was wondering if any of you guys could think of a reason why getting paid daily (like, I dunno, you clock out of work and like 5 min later the money for that shift is in your bank account or something) wouldn't work? I realize that there would be logistical hurdles and it'd be a pain to put in place, but are there any fundamental reasons it just wouldn't work no matter what we did?",False,ng2e5o,drunken_augustine,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ng2e5o/why_dont_we_get_paid_when_we_clock_out_each_day/,14,1

Here's the calculation; 

660mins = 11hrs 

570mins = 9.5hrs + 78mins (break) = 1.3hrs = 648 minutes 

648mins - 660mins = 12 minutes each day unpaid. 

I've pretty much missed out $5.76 on each day I worked. 

Am I making a big deal out of this? referring to my first post, we don't get our full time breaks, and it could classify as wage theft as we are working within our breaks, and we usually get out of the plant at around 4:10-4:15pm (start is at 5am), even with that finish we still get paid in the scope of 9.5 hrs without adding those extra minutes in.   


Also for those who've seen the first post, I already quit the job and it felt awesome to get out of a workplace that doesn't care for its employees, thank you for the advice and giving insights!

1791,How do I do this? I feel like I can't anymore.,"To start, I work graveyard (3rd shift) at a local gas station. When I first started working, $14 an hour doesn't seem bad to a 22 year old who has had very little job experience. Starting off I felt happy, I felt like I could do this job for a long time and just be happy making money. 

Well that was until I decided to finance a car through carvana and get insurance. My bi-weekly checks are around $800, with my monthly car payment being $288, monthly rent (with parents) about $250, and a monthly insurance payment of $148. That may not sound bad to most of you who are living independently, but I know 100% i cannot afford to live on my own. Not with the car and the insurance I've saddled myself with.

Now back to the job. Its repetitive, its mind numbing dull. The work is easy, but its on my feet all day and I've had some bad knee injuries through my life due to skateboarding, and my legs just can't keep up with the pace. Not to mention that in the dead of night in a sketchy part of town, im required to go outside and clean up the pump area which is constantly littered with cigarette butts, swisher wrap tobacco, fountain drink cups, food from various places drop haphazardly on the floor, and not to mention the homeless druggies that wander onto the property because of the mental health clinic in the adjacent parking lot.

This job makes me hate people. Like, I genuinely get happy when I can tell a customer I can't help them, or when I can smile and point at the ""employee break"" sign while a customer frustratingly tugs on the locked door LOOKING AT EVERYTHING except for the sign right in front of their fucking face saying IM ON BREAK. I'm so, so, SO tired of cleaning up after people. I'm tired of being threatened with violence for asking people for an I.D. Most nights id be completely fine if a customer walked around the counter and knocked me out, at least then I could get some fucking sleep.

The job makes me hate my life, it makes me dread existing, and it makes the car that I got seem very, very not worth it. I feel trapped in this job. My manager is very kind to me, and we're understaffed as it is so me leaving will really hurt her. Despite my hate for the company, she's working 7 days a week right now due to the assistant manager having a mental break and going on vacation. If I leave, she has nobody to cover my shift. 

Even if she was in a position to replace me, the only jobs I have available to me are the same, standing all day, dealing with assholes kind of jobs that I know ill hate more than this because the boss won't be as chill as my current. I didn't graduate college, I have no special skills I can use to try and sneak into something better, I don't feel like I have any hope left in my body to get out.

1797,So basically been out of work since mid Feb.,"So was working for my local Wal Mart and was as overnight maintenance was on the verge of burn out.  Well I had gotten an ear infection and also thought I might have had COVID cause my sense of taste was gone.  So I decided to take the two weeks, get a test done and see how things go.  I do get a test done but it comes up negative but decide to still two weeks off.  By the end of the two weeks, my sense of taste was still garbage so decided to extend time off by another two weeks and get a second test to make sure the first test wasn't a false negative while all time I was dealing with a sinus and ear infection that went away as long as didn't go anywhere in sub freezing temps.

&amp;#x200B;

You may wonder why I didn't get the infections taken care of?  Cause I didn't have insurance, cause was barely making enough money as is that a little bit more deducted from would have hurt me finically as is.  So while was spending time at home as the days quickly approached I was supposed to return to work. I was dreading it cause my social anxiety and depression was building up again.  

Part of my depression has stopped me from doing the most basic care for myself.  I would literally just get up, put on some deodorant if feeling up to it put on same work clothes night in and night out, go to my job then come home, veg out on couch a bit go to sleep and do entire cycle over again really not caring much.  My depression is at point right now in my life I am not actively looking to end myself, but if something to happen to me, I have no regrets passing on.

So after the 4 week of not going to work I decided I'm not going in, that I was done working for WM.  But cause I had been out of work for a month, I needed money so had to ask my mother and sister for finical support until my tax refund and stimulus check could carry me through until I found a new job.

I did find a new job working for call center which I could do at home, working for New York State DMV.  Even though not the most social person I thought since was just taking calls at home I could fake it.  I started that job on March 17th, but lasted at that job for about two weeks before my social anxiety started getting the better of me and I started to email every day an excuse why I couldn't take calls that day.  This pattern lasted for a month until I got fired and have been living off stimulus and tax refund money.  Now that money is running out .  I know I need to start looking for a job, but my depression and social anxiety has gotten to point where thought of leaving the apartment holds me back.",False,nfuep7,Ok_Necessary2991,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nfuep7/so_basically_been_out_of_work_since_mid_feb/,2,1

They have never had a problem with me or how I babysit. The husbands family loved me his mom and grandma were very kind to me, whereas the mothers family made me feel intimidated and not welcome (her mom and grandma). Everything was going great until my last day, I was instructed to take the kids 1 and 3 years old to the moms house, where the grandma would be watching their cousin who is also 3. We did this because the wifi was out and she didn't want me to suffer because it was also a rainy day. The grandma was asleep and the little girl had woken up and was playing unattended when I arrived. Then the grandma had left without telling me even though the cousin was not my responsibility. After she arrived back several hours later I had put the baby down for a nap and the other two were playing. I then saw the kids playing with her and accidentally fell asleep (only because I knew another adult was there watching them) as I was not feeling well and wanted to take the time I had a break from them resting. I woke up an hour later and the grandma had purposefully woken the baby up and left the children alone in the bedroom. I was fired three days later before I was supposed to return to work for them the next day because I had taken the nap. Come to find out the grandma had made up several other things that never happened so I am sure that played a factor in me being fired. Since there was no cameras at the house it was a case of she said and she said. Her word against mine. Mind you not even two weeks before I was asked to come on a saturday for a special occasion and the cousins mom and the family I babysit for mom were talking in front of me about how the grandma had broken the cousins collarbone and was trying to convince them not to take her to the hospital because she was lying about how it happened, they had suspicions that she had broken it by grabbing her and pulling her too hard then pushing her. Should I have been fired? If I would have known the grandma cared that I rested I would not have, but she was a perfectly capable adult watching them also. She also lied and said she had left while I was sleeping but why would she leave three children alone if she knew I was resting? Her whole story had fabricated pieces that just didn't make sense. If the family has never seen me leave the children alone before and know the grandma lies then I don't understand why I was fired (other than the napping but I made sure an adult member was there watching them as I would never do it under any other circumstance).",False,nfv2yo,Zealousideal-Put5959,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nfv2yo/who_was_in_the_wrong/,16,1

The grass might seem greener the other side when you are getting a pay cheque (despite of working sulking and grumbling) but is it really so? or is it just a perception?

The employee getting the raise is the one that hid in the back while I talked this junky done and kicked him out.  

He throws active loud temper tantrums at work constantly when he’s told to do anything he dislikes. He sometimes doesn’t even complete nightly tasks that are required to be done for the computers sake otherwise causing your management to spend hours fixing it. 

He also tells us at least once every time a conversation that his dad his a doctor and pays his bills so he doesn’t even need to be here. He calls out constantly and is requesting kids of time off and gets it because otherwise he throws a temper tantrum. 

He yells at management and starts confrontations with other employees often. We also control music so when he’s on he takes over music and starts playing heavy metal with general topics about “I’m not getting laid so I want to kill”. He also frequently tells us how he’s so angry he could kill.

1840,"Give no loyalty, for you shall receive none.","Just another story of a shitty employer and my eventual triumph to brighten your day. It's a long one, TL;DR is at the bottom. 

I had been working for this digital content company for a couple of years. I had recently been married, and we were on the fence about moving from IL to AZ,  for several reasons (financial, weather sucks, etc.). My wife was working a retail job at Meijer, so she was fully on board with moving, but we decided to wait until after my 2-year performance review to see if I could negotiate a salary that would justify staying put. Originally, I was hired to manage support and deployments for all of the media content players at all client sites, which numbered in the hundreds. I had an extensive IT background coming in, but actively sought out this job as a change of pace. 

Cue the bait and switch - they suddenly fired the full-time IT guy a couple months after I started (think small company, about 20 total employees, but IT was still a full-time job for one person). What has two thumbs and inherited all of those responsibilities in addition to his own? This guy! From that point on, I was expected to perform two $40k+ per year jobs while being paid for one, which I did, admirably, I might add. No matter, I figured that I could demonstrate my value and parlay that into a nice salary in the future. Boy, was I wrong.

When review time came, they offered to increase my salary from $42k to $45k. I brought up the fact that my skillet and hard work had enabled them to trim their payroll considerably and that I had been effectively doing two jobs. Not only did they scoff at me (""why do *you* deserve that money?"" ), but told me in no uncertain terms that I was at the ceiling pay rate for my position. Basically, I shouldn't expect to receive another pay raise for a long time, if ever. In response, I threw the hammer down right there during the review and told them I'm moving out of state. They showed no interest in allowing me to transition my role to AZ, so I just put in my notice on the spot.

They scrambled to find a replacement for me, hired a guy {a man nearing retirement age, in Texas (WTF!?), and I found out they started him at $52k (Double WTF?!)}. So they actually flew me down to Austin to train the guy for a few days. I mostly drank Tito's cocktails and ate brisket sandwiches in the hotel room, but I got the guy up to speed. I had fully documented the day-to-day tasks of the position and there was a full, peaceful knowledge transfer. Anyway, I moved to Arizona a month later and we have zero regrets. 

Now the fun part: I kept in occasional touch with the office manager chick from the media company, and I found out that my ""replacement"" quit abruptly after a few months and left them in a big-time lurch. It took them several weeks to find someone else, and that person had to learn the role completely on their own. Clients were lost, bosses were pissed, etc. In addition to that, they burned through that person and a couple of others in the months that followed. It was a big mess, resulting in lost revenue and frustration all around. It felt really good to learn that their unwillingness to pay me resulted in a vacuum that sucked their overall profitability for a period of time. 

TL;DR - Left a job that didn't value me, they paid the price and then some and it was hilarious. Any expressed loyalty from an employer is an illusion. Screw 'em!",False,nepqt3,ThePookums,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nepqt3/give_no_loyalty_for_you_shall_receive_none/,8,1

1852,Capitalism will never allow a workers market,"    No matter how terrible the “labor shortage” we are now seeing in the economy gets, the capitalists will never raise wages much higher than subsistence levels. If labor, being as necessary as it is, got it’s fair share in a labor shortage, then that would mean in a labor shortage it would be workers who get to choose what firm to work for instead of firms being choosy about what workers they get. Owners would be outbidding one another constantly - every place you apply at would be offering a higher wage than the next one, sterling benefit packages would quickly become normal, and employers would be bending over backward to keep what workers they have. This, they say, is how the market is supposed to work. 

But none of this happens. Instead wages stagnate and owners begin to cry loudly about the “dignity of work” and of the need for “self-starters” and “dedicated” applicants. They have to - if the workers became aware that it is they, not the owners, that can decide what businesses and opportunities get support, that they and not the owners are what make production go - then we would have socialism! The owners can’t give up the ghost, not even once, for once the workers find out just how much more they can make without the sky falling as the owners so often claim the workers will never go back to believing the lie.

So the owners rely on the phantasm introduced and maintained by the neoliberal project - the philosophy of the “dream job”. With it they fooled so many into believing that the point of life was to work, that work was what made one a “good citizen”, it made one “moral”, a “productive member of society”. What nonsense! All just smoke and mirrors to dupe workers out of their wages and to distract them from class consciousness. All so that the gains from technology and automation went to them and not to us.

Work is bullshit! The whole point of us living together in a society is to be rid of it! I don’t need other people to heap work on me - I can find my own way of spending my time! And yet this is exactly what this economy does - the owners are just coming up with bullshit work for us all to do to keep us from forgetting what neoliberalism spent so much time drilling into our collective heads. For only with that phantasm can the people be persuaded into taking the pittance the capitalists offer.

So yell it from the rooftops! Work is a sin! The hard-working employee is a fool, a clown, a naive dipshit who believes the lies of miserly old men! The politicians are all bastards - each and every one of them will insist that only those Americans who work without complaint are “good citizens” worth listening to. The poor and unemployed are just their wards, not their constituents. In other words, the politicians will serve you only if you serve the masters.

So far, i've gone to a couple of unassisted shifts and, well, i've really struggled with it.

In addition to the physical effects of the job, it's taken a real psychological toll. The customers can be a dick to me, and sometimes I'm condescended to (I go to a fancy state school, and saw a customer that goes to the same school; I pointed this out to her, and I could almost hear the condescention and disgust dripping from her voice, as if I'm tainting her school with labor unbefitting to it). When I think about how this is going to be what the rest of my life is like (only 2 days a week to myself, with the rest of it dedicated to an unthinking corporate entity), I just feel incredibly hopeless. I need this job to save up for an apartment with my girlfriend next summer (her parents are abusive to her, so it's almost urgent that we remove ourselves from this situation), and my family will be pissed at me if i quit, so I don't think quitting is an option, but I'm just wondering what the hell to do.

1862,Am I antiwork? Help me figure out what to do.,"So lads, let me tell you my story. I need to share it somewhere, and I can't think of a better place than this sub. Please try not to hate me for my white-collar perspective on things. 

I have been in sick leave for an extended time now. The doctors consider me unable to work at this time, and I am, due to depression caused primarily by lockdown isolation but secondarily by some underlying issues that probably would have thrown me off at some point anyway. I am making an effort to recover, and it seems that I am. However, I am not sure whether recovering is such a great idea. If I never recover, then I never have to work again (or work significantly reduced hours) and I get to keep my income. Of course, the downside then is that I probably will not grow, and will not have a career. So I am at a crossroads (one where it's not said I get to really choose the direction but anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

To provide some details: I'm now in my early thirties, have a decent job (90th percentile income in age-corrected distribution) with excellent benefits, live in a Central/Northern Euro country. Note that I still can't afford a decent house or anything like that, so to be honest whether you are 50th or 90th percentile really barely makes a difference. The difference is a better car, a slightly nicer vacation, and a slightly nicer house, full stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Without providing details, let's say my childhood was pretty fun and normal until, starting at 6-10 years old, my self-esteem and sense of self-started to become warped. I was, at 10 years old, a philosopher. I figured out how ""what you call green, and what I see as green, might be something totally different to both of us and we would never even know"", and many other insights. I never read a book about philosophy in my life. My father, who studied philosophy, would always find a way to invalidate my views through some bullshit academic literature (probably why I never bothered reading any). He did many other things to invalidate me as a person on many different levels. Long story short, I grew up both fearing and hating the world, and questioning my place in it, whether I was worth one at all. This recently became clear to me and I have been living with this ""defect"" until now, hiding it from both myself and the world. This obviously impacted my life, both professionally and socially, in a very negative way. Of course, this is summarized, but let's say that I constantly feel like I am being rejected and bullied, even when not, and that I figured this out but that it nevertheless takes a massive effort to get through normal daily life this way, and to focus on things which are not terribly important to me, like (this) work.

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, I was essentially ignored and I ignored everyone, as much as possible. I was never bullied, but I also never had friends. I was just that person nobody knew what to do with, and I knew not what to do with anyone. I (recently) considered I may have autism, but I feel that autism is a rare condition and that getting where I am, and doing so in a way that is both excruciatingly painful and effortless at the same time, seems implausible to say the least. In any case, my social skills and trust in/cooperativeness towards the world took a big hit.

&amp;#x200B;

After high school, I managed to go to a uni where normally only the offspring of very rich parents go (don't ask how. My parents are poor, divorced, my mom is on welfare level and it cost me a lot to go to this place, let's keep it at that). I, and one other kid, were the exceptions to this rule (and a handful of reasonably but not very rich stock). This warped my view of the world even further. I saw first-hand how incredibly effortlessly they moved through life, how much fun they had, how everything that I would have to break my back to have, was simply handed to them by birthright. How they squandered it, how they were, essentially for the most part - and I know I am not God and thou shalt not judge, but I cannot contain myself - human trash. In any case, none of them were any better than the ""normies"", and most of them were worse. My social skills at the time were still very poor, and my Machiavellianism at a very low level, otherwise I might have been more effective and used the opportunity to ingratiate myself with them. After all, being friends with a guy with a boat is better than owning a boat. Alas, I dropped out after two years.

&amp;#x200B;

I then tried and failed at a number of ""normal"" uni programs. Always due to a lack of work ethic on my part, although my reasoning at the time was ""I simply want to go my own way, f this conformity stuff, I don't want to be a sheep and they do not teach anything useful at uni anyway"". I tried to set up my own businesses or code my own applications to sell, and although others would compliment my progress, quality of work, and work ethic, this never amounted to much actual financial success. In hindsight, it was solely due to a lack of perseverance, which went unnoticed both by myself and my environment, because I am at the same time quite perseverant in nature. It's the irony of progress without progress, that I still can't explain very well to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around the time when I was 26 I had still accomplished very little, both socially and professionally, and I saw my life completely stagnating. I decided I had to ""do something"" and so picked up relatively menial work in IT. I thus experienced what many on this sub experience, being treated like a worthless maggot working for someone else's profit. I could not stomach the fact that this company would place me somewhere, pay me 10/hr (14 including all the bennies I would say), and then the client would pay them 50/hr. All the while they assumed no risk because I was a temp anyway. I do not mind paying a middle man for stuff that's useful to me (like placing me in a working position), but you cannot tell me I am worth 50/hr to someone and pay me 10 (especially because now the client expects me to deliver 50 worth of output, while I expect to deliver, at the very most, 20). So I left, found myself a government contract to tender myself on, and then I was the one taking the 80/hr (started at 40). I did that for 2 years until I became too disgusted with the fact that these managers would pay me anything I wanted because they ""liked me"" (or something), and it was just budget they had to get rid of anyway (given to them by good honest taxpayers mind you), for a job that hardly needed doing. Unfortunately, those government tenders are rarer now and only open to middle men generally.

&amp;#x200B;

So I left and went to complete my degree after all. Eventually, I graduated with honours with an MSc that's extremely employable, and effortlessly found a job at what could be easily called an A-list employer. I grew dissatisfied, as I always do, and jumped to another job. The offer was great, and what's the greatest about it is that they offered me an indeterminate period contract right from the start, affording me a position of relative power and security.  Too bad for them I called in sick reasonably shortly after starting.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I think about it is that for the ""premium"" slaves to function, their labour camp must have no walls, and lenient guards. These sheep are smart and so they must feel the premium. They need to experience ""trust"". I talk to my coworkers in more diplomatic terms about my views on how we are exploited as labour, and they all talk about how they are quite happy to be in this position, how they are doing much better than everyone else their/our age, and so forth. And I tell them ""but you still can't buy a house, raise a family, support a wife (or a husband, I am not a gender role purist) those kinds of things. Your parents could do these things, and they were much less productive than you. How is that fair?"". And their eyes kind of glaze over and they go on with their work. They always talk about how busy they are. It's like they want to be busy. Being busy is a massive part of their identity. Busy little bees, buzzing in my ear. Responding to the question ""why do you enjoy this work?"" I had one respond ""well you know, I just want to be in a good position and I think the world will always have a huge demand for people who are handy at solving problems with numbers (excel) and so I see this as progress towards valuable skillsets"". I did not tell him that I think most of the world's current ills are precisely because of a huge surplus of people who think they can solve problems with excel, and society is doing its very best to accommodate them all with bullshit jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Talking to these people was, in fact, a major source of my depression. Because I had always figured that once the string was pulled excessively, it would at some point snap. Never had I thought it could be pulled as much as it has, and never had I thought to think it could be pulled even further still, and that the snapback might occur when I am well into my 50's, done by a different, less complacent, less childlike generation than mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order for me to move from nothing to this premium labour camp, I had shut down my entire personality (I don't have one anymore), my entire view on life (I don't have a consistent view), my entire will to even live (that's mostly gone). Nothing about me has any personality. My furniture has good taste, but no personality. My clothes are in good taste but lack any discernable identity. My physical health is great (on measurements), yet my posture is not. There seems to be nothing wrong with me, yet everything's out of place.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I find myself in a position where I am in a camp with very weak walls and lenient guards. If the camp finds me defective, the camp will let me out and even bear the cost of my departure fully. The camp will afford to me, in essence, the same privilege as is afforded to the rich, namely a guaranteed and reasonably high income forever, until death, without the need for reciprocation. I'll even continue to build a pension. I can even leave the country. And now, considering this, I find myself in a situation where I am essentially dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde. Even me. Even on me, deep down perhaps one of the stauncher anti-work, anti-rich types you will find, this invisible wall has an effect. Simply because their hold on my balls is not so iron tight, I am more willing to accept a loose grip, even if the bottom line is the same (I work for someone else's luxurious lifestyle).

&amp;#x200B;

dr. Jekyll says:

\-You came so far. You are part of the team now, finally. You are on the good side of this, you should stay and do your best.

\-Your issues are caused by personality defects from childhood. These are not really you. Good normal people fit in. You pretty much fit in now, just recover and go on. 

\-Society is not so bad. Look at the social safety net? And yes, objectively, it is much better than what most of you on this sub go through and I truly feel for you and those pulling the even shorter straws. I almost feel bad for complaining at all.

\-With the COVID situation, society is extremely unstable right now. It is better to be in the building than outside of it (I work at a large multinational, yes I am a horrible person, part of the problem, an enforcer of evil, etc). 

\-I like my team members. I like my manager even though they are also corporate drones and bought the fairy tale hook line and sinker, I still see them as people and I do not mind being around them. 

\-If you continue working, you can probably become a premium premium slave and then you can command rates of upwards of 150/hr on the free market. You will have lots more money yay. 

\-Fix yourself, find your identity while still being a part of this world. Don't go and sit on the sidelines. 

&amp;#x200B;

mr. Hyde says:

\-All you ever wanted in life was to get out of the race. All you ever do is save up. Here's your chance! What are you some kind of moron? Why are you even thinking this through?

\-Nobody ever gave you anything, nobody ever gave you even a nickel that they did not expect to have you return to them threefold. You do not owe anybody anything.

\-This country is not for you. This society's values are not your values. You have no business building a pyramid you do not even like, in return for no stake in it, while others enjoy its (your!!!) fruits undeservingly.

\-What are you gonna work for like 4-5 weeks of vacation a year? What you need is 54 weeks of vacation a year buddy. 

\-You know very well you would do things with your life eventually. Do you think you are doing things with your life right now? You aren't. You may not make money doing it, but you will never do nothing. It is not in your nature to want to contribute nothing. 

\-Because of my shitty childhood and many many failures in life (unfinished degrees, short-term employments etc) it will be easy to convince the medical community that something is so medically wrong with me I cannot work. And to be frank, maybe there actually is.

\-Stop worrying and jump.

1864,They want me to be frugal? So be it.,"That's it. I've had enough. I will not bore you with details, but I'm done with this system. I've worked in the past years for about 50 h/week plus about 25 h/week of commute, all for a wage that is below any standard of decency.  

However I know that if I starve to dead nothing will change.  
Beside the people close to me, nothing will change and I'll be replaced within 2 days.  

That's why I'm starting my own protest: I will not buy anything anymore beside basic needs (food, basic clothes, etc.).  
They want me to have the wage of a slave? They can go buy their shit themselves, they can go to the restaurant, to the movies, and so on. I'm not spending a penny more than I strictly need to survive.  

I want to see the system crumble under its own weight.  

Hollywood accounting makes it so they can avoid paying taxes, just because they can? Guess what, I can download any movie I want for free (God bless the internet).  
They want to charge hundreds for education and exploit students with asinine policies on textbooks? Guess what, I can download any book I want for free (God bless the internet).  
They can find ways to avoid paying any taxes, to the point that I pay more in taxes than millionaires CEOs? They can buy their shit themselves, because I sure as hell won't do it.  

I will probably be alone on this one (and I will never resent anyone for not joining me), because living without the carrots they dangle in front of us means that there would only be the stick in our lives, but just the thought of denying them the money I earned in blood and sweat gives me enough motivation, at least for the time being.  

Let's see if I can buy my own freedom.  

To all of you who are going through the hardship of being a working poor in these times, I would seriously like to hug each and every one of you: I feel your pain, and I love you for your resilience.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the bosses (they're 3) barely ever come to help, and when they come, they just laze around. Of course.

 Next, work yourself all the way down to the bone for 80-100 hrs/wk for 4-6 years in residency. Grind, grind grind. A weekend is a hallelujah, and you don't get many of those. Again you're treated like shit and the pressure and stress is super high. Overnight calls. 24 hr shifts. On top of that, you need to study more, so you don't kill your patients.

They just can’t wrap their head around the fact that some people value free time over money. I don’t want to work every night until I burnout. I wanna come home and just chill.

1894,"A question to capitalist/pro-labour lurkers: if work is such an important, character-building thing, why do you never talk about how the descendants of rich people will grow up to be emotionally stunted and have no ""real world experience"" or ""character""?","Let me start with the numbers here.

The last I saw, the average amount of money spent across the average Westerner's lifetime is $4million. Let's take that at face value for now and just assume it's accurate and not lumping billionaires into the ""average"" (we can discuss the nuances to these figures in the comments). Taking the richest man in the US, Jeff Bezos, as our example, we can do some basic maths:

Bezos' net worth is around $187billion. 

$187billion/4milllion=46750

What does that figure mean? It means that, if the above figure is accurate, that Bezos has enough money for FORTY-SEVEN THOUSAND HUMAN LIFETIMES. But this post isn't about him or how that hoarded wealth affects us; this is about how it will affect his descendants, according to your logic.

Bezos' child/children will never have to work a day in their lives. They will never gain the ""real world experience"" or the development of ""character"" that you apologists think is so necessary for a fulfilling capitalist life. Neither will his grandchildren. Or his great grandchildren.

Assuming two things: 1) that every descending generation will be one child, and 2) not accounting for either inflation of the dollar or the interest of his band account, we can do a less-basic calculation with a 20-year generation and an 80-year lifespan. I say less basic because, after sitting here for 20 minutes making sure I did this right, I'm still not 100% sure I did, so please, if I cocked up this calculation, let's have a discussion in the comments.

46750/20=2337.5

This means that Bezos' entire family, given the above assumptions, will never have to even think about work for _TWO THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED, THIRTY-SEVEN **GENERATIONS**_.

So, the question from the title: if work is such an important, character-building part of society, why can every single billionaire in the world make sure that their descendants will never have to work again for THOUSANDS of years, leaving the rest of us to fight over the scraps of money that they AREN'T hoarding (yet)?",False,nem762,Jader14,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nem762/a_question_to_capitalistprolabour_lurkers_if_work/,39,1

We had weekly office targets that we had to reach and if we reached said target prior to 5pm Friday we would get to leave early, sounds good right?

Wrong, around two weeks ago i brought in a massive sale allowing everyone to go home but me as i had to process the sale so i would be at work way past 5pm, i asked my manager can i finish processing this at home (as we were able to take our laptops home) as i don't see it being fair that i'm the only one here i didn't get a response so i decided i don't see any issue with me taking my laptop home and left, i grab some food and check my phone to see 25 missed calls from my boss demanding that i get back into the office and finish processing, i felt like crying being bullied into going back when its something i could easily do from home.

One week later somebody else does a big sale getting us out of work and im excited, i had plans to see a friend after work and grab a few drinks so the earlier the better, i stand up, pack my things away only to be told ""where are you going?"" i said what do you mean it's home time is it not and was then told i was behind target so i was staying, keep in mijd i was never told what my target actually was, i walked out i could here my manager complaining about the fact i left to other managers and the next day i ask her for a 1 on 1 meeting where i hand in my notice she didn't see it coming as she was speechless but it felt good.

I should not have you asking me if I checked the office inbox because you see two unread emails sitting in there. Excuse me! I have my own inbox to clear through. I have plenty of duties that fall outside of ""Checking the group mailbox"". 

In case you havent noticed, I am a very competent professional. So much so, that people in the organization skip coming to you altogether and just come straight to me because they trust me to handle things. Stop acting like I dont have my own task to complete. I didnt win an annual award for manning the group inbox soooo proficiently. So yes, you know I just came from leave. With that, you know theres a chance that my own inbox is full. Calm down with calling me about dumb shxt when you KNOW im busy.

1906,Have to go back to hell,"I've taken unpaid leave for 9 weeks for suicidal depression and anxiety spurred on by my horrible job. I was hoping to find a new job during this time, but I've had no luck. I don't interview well due to anxiety and what I suspect is undiagnosed autism. I'm going back later this week, and I want to die still. No amount of medication or therapy can make working in that place for 9 hours a day better.


I was a fresh college kid when I started, and didn't know how to say no to the frankly unreasonable number of different projects and responsibilities being assigned to me, and the complete lack of support, training, or growth opportunities left me feeling lost. Plus, my coworkers are all hard right wing boomers, and my closeted nonbinary gay ass has to sit there and listen to racist and homophobic jokes all day, or not-really-offensive-but-still-weird comments about my weight or gender, or comments about ""brainwashed college liberals,"" clearly referring to me. No one double checks my work or really tells me how to do anything, so I just do my best and guess where needed -- and then deal with the consequences of inevitable mistakes. I feel like I have learned nothing and have nothing to show but 2 years of stress and depression.

And I have to go back. 

It sucks all the energy out of me. The past 9 weeks of freedom have been amazing despite the lack of money and the drain on my dwindling savings -- I've started doing hobbies again, even. But when I go back, all that energy and time will be eaten up by the place I hate. I get home with barely enough energy to feed myself and my cats, and then I waste my 2 hours of freedom on video games that don't require a lot of brain power before collapsing into bed.

1. Your health declines.

2. Your mental health diminishes.

3. Your relationships suffer.

4. You are making other richer, while your salary doesn’t even keep up with inflation and today’s living expenses.

5. Your vacation (if you get any) is a conditional reward for staying but you are programmed to feel guilty for taking any, despite the fact you earned it.

6. You are not even human, you are a replaceable member of a money making organism.

7. Human resources DOES NOT care about you, they are the enforcer of pain and authority.

8. You get taxed for your little income and taxed again when you buy things you need. Reflect on that when you get paid.

9. Retirement is the end goal, but will you make there alive and healthy enough to even joy it or die working?

10. You are required to give 2 weeks before you change jobs, your boss is required an email to send you to unemployment and economical turmoil.

11. You signed up to work 40 hours, but they didn’t tell you that you are expected 40+ but no extra pay.

12. The management ladder is broken. The fools that chase it end up with minuscule salary increases and ton more expectations on personal time sacrifice and workload. 

13. One income households are dead. Tomorrow your offspring will likely need to work as soon as is legally possible to help keep with expenses.

14. We have the technology to automate but refuse to accept universal basic income to allow humans being humans.

I'm not even talking about the term ""wage slave"" which is already pretty dicey.  I'm talking about how often I see people saying that low-paying jobs are literally as bad as slavery.

I get the sentiment, and there are definitely parellels to be drawn between slavery and our employment systems (especially on the lower-paying and more exploitative side). But as wrong as the ""if you don't like your job then leave"" people are, that *is* an option.  Sure, it might be an option with pretty disasterous consequences, but you will not be hunted and returned to your job.

I'm not here to say anything good about capitalism or modern day labor practices, but I don't think strong comparisons to slavery are ever going to help further any ideas that this sub stands for.

I am fully aware that this kind of sentiment is 100% disrespectful towards anyone who lost loved ones to the pandemic, who lost their business as a result of the lockdowns, who lost everything, etc... But still, just hear me out.

Before the second wave of the pandemic in Authumn, I had to commute to work. And I hated it. 4 hours of unpaid commute added to my workdays, turning my de jure 8 hour workdays into de facto 12 hour workdays. Literally no free time on weekdays, none. 

Thanks to the second wave of Covid-19, they allowed me to switch to remote work in September. In January, they even allowed us to have flexible schedules instead of 9-to-5.

If the pandemic ends, they might demand my return to the office. And if that happens, I'll quit, even if I have no backup plan.

1950,Advice on Leaving a Toxic Job,"Hi everyone, 

I just came across this sub while looking for shared experience and thought it would be a good place to ask for advice. Buckle in, this may be a long read but I really appreciate anyone who reads it through. 

I work at a clinic. I got hired last year and worked for exactly one week before I got laid off due to COVID. A few months later, they asked me to come back on a limited schedule rather than the full time schedule we had agreed to, mostly to serve as backup for my co worker who had been a fixture for 13 years. 

Our office manager is the kind of person who wants things accomplished her way, no matter who it alienates along the way. That often involves staff and at times involves patients. Her condescending and passive aggressive attitude led to her butting heads with my co worker, who was expected to learn a slew of new polices and procedures while working 12 hour days, almost always without breaks and reduced lunches due to the impossible workload. 

Fast forward to about two months ago, and I get a weekend call from my manager saying that my co worker had been fired and if I could come in and cover her shifts. In shock, I text my co worker and she tells me it was done without warning and that the manager and owner were needlessly cruel with how they went about it. I felt dirty and didn’t want to help them move on from their decision scot free, but this career path is important to me and I didn’t want to no show. At the very least, I decided I would apply for other jobs in the meantime. 

Except that soon became very hard to do because I found myself basically working her schedule. I refused to forego my breaks, but still, long days where I’m responsible for greeting patients in person, manning the phones, recruiting new patients and dealing with insurance companies all at the same time left me completely drained. They promised that they would have someone hired within a month, but it’s been almost two with only one interview that I’ve seen. It’s becoming increasingly clear that they’re expecting me to carry this load for as long as it’s convenient for them, and all without me officially being upgraded to a full time employee, meaning I’m getting no benefits. 

On top of that, they started disputing my overtime pay. I’m in CA. Everyone I’ve talked to and every job I’ve worked at has paid me OT for anything over 8 hours in a single day. One time, they went in and changed my time card without my knowledge and said that part time employees only get OT above 10 hours in a day, or over 40 hours in a week. I researched it plenty when this happened, and while I found a few sources that confirmed their claims, I found way more that confirmed mine. When I questioned them, they had a page ready to go from the state saying what they were claiming, which made it more confusing because I had a statement that said the opposite from the same site. Feeling drained, I spoke to a lawyer who suggested I let the OT build up, then file a case once I quit for everything at once. 

Anyway, that brings us to last Friday. A patient was at risk for being charged out of pocket because of an insurance issue. Their doctor told me to call them and let them know in case they decided to cancel and not risk the high payment. Between calling the insurance company, handling a phone that was ringing off the hook for 2 hours, handling patients in person and filing 75 pages of paperwork, 7 hours with no breaks had suddenly passed. I didn’t want to leave my brand new co worker alone too long so she wouldn’t be overwhelmed, so I cut my lunch in half and rushed back to the office. 

In the time that I was gone, there were 5 more phone calls I had to return and a message from my manager saying not to cancel the patient with the insurance issue. Unfortunately, I didn’t see the message until I returned all the calls, so by the time I did, the patient had already been cancelled. Simply put, she was angry. She texted me and included the owner in the thread asking me why I ignored her message. I have a timeline of exactly how it went down, and I was greeted with messages from both the owner and manager basically blaming me for not knowing any better. That I should “ask questions if I don’t know what to do”, (something I avoid because the manager has yelled at me before for asking too many questions).

Now, my frustration turns to anger because I both did what the doctor told me to do, (which I agreed with because the patient shouldn’t have be blindsided with sudden charges), and because I’ve been directed by the manager to do so. I have also seen both her and my old co worker do it in the past for similar reasons. To imply it was due to my ignorance rather than the massive workload making me miss the message, the short time frame we had to make a decision or the lack of staffing killed me mentally.

Eventually the doctor listened to me vent for almost two hours and was nice enough to give me a ride home. He talked me down from straight up walking out, but I decided to use the weekend to cool off and make a more rational decision. Before I left, I made sure to send a lengthy, but professional text to the manager and owner explaining how frustrated I was because of the workload, how I feel like I’m just plugged in as a replacement instead of a valued individual and that this environment is unsustainable. That things will naturally fall through the cracks and that there’s no one individual to blame, but an overall failure of management to maintain proper staffing. 

I decided to give my two weeks tomorrow, mostly because I don’t want them to label me as difficult to my co workers who see me in a positive light and because my college friend got me this job and I don’t want to have my actions reflect poorly on her. That was until a little while ago when I got a response from the owner saying he’s surprised that I did what I did because training said otherwise, (again, I’ve done this plenty of times and have seen others do it repeatedly), and that it’s not their fault that we’re understaffed because “they’re not just going to hire anybody”. No mention of any of the concerns I had like being overworked or set up for failure. Just more blame towards me and excuses for them. 

So my ultimate question at this point is: should I give them the two weeks? It’s obvious they have no respect for me and I feel like doing so gives up some of my power. I wouldn’t past them to suddenly fire me like they did my co worker for standing up for myself. Any other advice regarding the overtime claim or any potential case my former co worker might have for her working conditions or her sudden firing would be appreciated too.

1955,The Founding Americans understood and were pro Collective Bargaining,"The two most unpopular taxes when the US was founded were the Head Tax and the Property Tax.

A Head Tax is a tax someone has to pay just to be alive and the Property Tax had to be paid if you wanted a place to live. They were unavoidable and the politicians were able to use them to single people out and pit groups against each other. 

This is why taxes are supposed to be apportioned and not have direct taxes that single out individuals. This is the same idea as a company that favors one group of employees over another to prevent unionization. When the workers are united then they have much more power than they do as individuals.

The founders of the country tried to do the same thing with taxes. If everyone has to pay taxes then the people would push back against corruption and an abusive government. But if some groups are punished and others favored then it is much easier to divide and conquer the tax cattle.

1958,I don’t work very much and it’s glorious - my story,"Antiworkers of reddit, there is hope. It can be done. I’ve been to corporate hell and back and lived (barely) to tell the tale. More importantly I vowed to design a life with little work and can finally say I’ve mostly accomplished this dream. Wanted to share my story for whoever is interested.

Background: I’ve worked my ass off since 15 years old, growing up in a culture of classic American values – namely – work yourself to the bone and identifying who you are with your occupation. I had every job under the sun for a young person: cashier, bagger, delivery driver, telemarketing for multiple companies, food runner, waiter and more. Then I graduated college and entered the workforce, initially leasing commercial office buildings then after being fired as a high performer on a sinking ship of a company, went to work at a large accounting firm and suffered miserable and long hours for four years. After being let go following burnout I tried several more corporate jobs and slowly realized this was not the life I wanted to live and made it my goal to design a different life.

Next Steps: To get to a point of making extreme life changes it usually requires an impetus through primary experience, and from what I gather reading this sub that is where most people here are now. This is what I did: first I moved to a low cost of living area and began budgeting on a weekly basis, eventually finding the balance of lowest expenses and good quality of life. Meanwhile, I earned my real estate license and found sponsorship at a broker.  I did take the time to master the components of being a Realtor and this took between 1-2 years. Then I went through marketing steps of generating inbound leads and also found a handful of properties to manage for owners who didn’t want to deal with it. I am not a high-volume real estate producer, not even close. Nor do I want to be, like any occupation real estate can consume your life if you let it. My aim was and is and will always be to close a sale or two per month, which in combination with property management meets my financial needs.

Current Life: This is where I am now: once a month I have to go through accounting for property management which takes about 8 hours. I also work about 2 hours a day on average in real estate. This comes out to about 15 hours a week total working mostly all from home. For the first time in my life I have both time and energy for hobbies. I exercise five days a week and cook most of my own meals. I have time and positivity to share with my girlfriend (she is in a bad corporate job and we are working on designing her a better life.)  There is time to spend with my dog, visit family and friends, and read books on weekdays. I have no kids which makes a massive difference and understand this lifestyle isn’t always feasible.

Takeaways: I am writing this to let people know there is hope; sometimes I see people on here wishing for actual death and I have been near to that point. It is absolutely insane how much we are brainwashed to obsess about working all the time. Even worse is the cancer that is corporate environments, which needs no explanation. Even now on a Monday and on other weekdays I occasionally feel guilty for not suffering at work. I feel like I have to hide my life from others because of their resentment. This eventually fades and the smokescreen of this awful working culture fades with it, and one can see this is how life absolutely, without question, is meant to be lived. Before we give up, before we consent to living this way until death, before we fall in line with soldiers in a losing battle, please remember we only have one chance to figure this life out and maybe it’s worth trying to design a better one that makes us happy. Even if it doesn’t work out you can say you tried. And if it does, well, maybe there’s a happy ending.",False,neoipa,DynamoPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/neoipa/i_dont_work_very_much_and_its_glorious_my_story/,13,1

1968,Advice on how to quit my job strategically?,"I've been at this job for about a month now. Pay isn't worth it for the hours and standing for 10-11 hours a day is unexpectedly flaring up old injuries. I'm on a salaried position but they clearly abuse that, they scheduled me to work ten days straight?!? Anyways, Worst part is the disrespect from management again and again. Today I asked to go home early, I couldn't take the pain from a previous surgery anymore. Mr. Owner of the company got \*very\* upset he went on a rant about how after this it would take a long time for me to move up in the company, how unbelievable this was, how he was probably going to have to lay me off, how this time was coming out of my paycheck etc. 

With this being said, starting next week Tuesday I have paid vacation days. When the owner and I agreed on the terms of employment a month ago he mentioned I could have  vacation days (not typically given until after a year of employment) paid for if I got had a certification related to the job. I obtained it and thus got the vacation.  I of course want to take advantage of the vacation time which I don't feel bad about at all, I've been underpaid this month so in my head this is the least this company could do. I plan to leave the job right after I get those days off. 

So how would you go about this? My guess is that my employer will want to lay me off/make me quit before I take those vacation days, or will use any excuse to justify that i don't deserve the vacation days anymore. I do have a doctors appointment tomorrow, if the doctor recommends a lighter work day for a week do you think they will lay me off right away? Should I quit only after i have received the check for vacation days? The company I work for does not have any specific vacation policy and the state of Wisconsin's laws pretty much state that the employer can do what they want as well.

So I got a therapist, and she has been amazing. She helped me with paperwork to put me on a fully PAID short term disability leave for at least 90 days, citing my mental health, with no pressure on an anticipated return date. Plus when I come back I’ll have accommodations such as a reduced schedule but still get paid the same amount, extra breaks, and he ability to call in once a week without penalty. It’s been about a month, and my sleep has improved from an average of 5 hours a night up to 8.5 hours a night. My head is clear and I feel like I can actually breathe. And the best part?

She always payed me late, spoke badly about me behind my back but they warned me, and she constantly unapologetically cale nagging to me about her damn UTI's (probably from her husband cheating lol). Hated her with a passion. Like bish what makes you think I care about you and your nasty fish barn, F off nasty pork and booze binging X'er.

Third one was another old cow boomer always emotional and nagging during meetings. Basically useless used up no good old tart who saw me as a threat. Company had 1 star on trustpilot so I don't know what the big deal was...

I am 24 with 2 bachelor degrees and have been to multiple jobs interviews with some relevance to my field of study, but remain unemployed. I can't even get an interview for a receptionist position... 

Currently I invest to earn passive income and to ultimately accrue long term savings. Since resigning, I've obviously had a mountain of time to pursue hobbies and have really improved my health with fitness and diet. 

Yet despite all this, I can't help but feel guilty. My career is stagnant and I'm constantly comparing myself to friends who have full time jobs (within their passion so some enjoyment comes from it), but I still wouldn't trade shoes with them because of time. I have so much of it and I love it, but goddamn do I feel guilty. This probably sounds so privileged, but I feel like I have really taken control of my time.   


Anyway, I think I know why I feel guilty. Cause my career is currently going nowhere and I hear everyone talking about the grind and hustle which somehow places a lot of self-worth on an individual and I don't receive that same satisfaction?

I’m sick of it. At a point in my life where I should have had a ‘career’ and be marking time until I can retire. I am nowhere near retirement age, but I should definitely have a plan.

I’ve hated every job I’ve had. Why? Because I literally CANNOT do the same thing for 40+ hours a week. I don’t even want to things I enjoy for 40+ hours a week.

I’ve decided that the absolute WORST part of working is not even the actual work part. It’s all the other SHIT that goes into it. Most of all it’s the people. Forced to spend 40+ hours with people I would probably choose to never even speak to.

tenickab You can feel however way you want to feel about
this statement but...the truth is, our goal is to NOT work. Or
to work on things that are not labor. There is no corporate
or nonprofit ladder interesting enough for me to climb
anymore. You can't entice me with a higher salary if you're
not giving me my time back. There are no stock option
great enough that | will exchange for my time, anymore. Is
James Baldwin once said...""| have no dream job. | don't
dream of labor."" By goal is freedom. To work on our
passions and still be able to eat, live good, and thrive. It is
less about accumulation wealth to consume more things
and more about proclaiming our time. Nothing about your
job impresses me because I'm not impressed by work. Our
ultimate goal is to get to a point where we control what we
do everyday. Our ultimate goal isn't to be seen or to be
popular. It is to gain enough posterity that we get to choose.
Because the ability to control your time is the ultimate
luxury. Everything else is just iting on the cake.

&gt;Hi &lt;hiring manager name&gt;,  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your email, I have to say that this is a disappointing but not very  
 unexpected answer, it seems like companies that have respect for candidates’  
 time are a rare occurrence these days.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding your comment: ""which is quite brittle and looks like it involved a  
 whole lot of copy-pasting"".  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If by brittle you mean ""likely to break"" then probably yes, any code can break  
 if the data changes. That's not good or bad, it's just how it is. I don't think  
 you even considered my code thoroughly because if you did, you would know that  
 my code includes unit tests to prevent such a thing from happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And what do you mean with copy-pasting? Why is that bad necessarily?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;My code works and that's what matters, could it be improved? Probably. Is it  
 perfect? Not even close to your standards apparently, but guess what, your  
 condescending attitude is also disappointing and says a lot about what working  
 there would be like.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't think your company understands software development and I am inclined  
 to think that you are doing this to feel better about yourself.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I spent three days on this and fulfilled the expectations from the  
 specification, therefore I would like to get paid for the time spent on this.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Please send 0.01 BTC to this address:  
 &lt;bitcoin address&gt;  
 to pay will result in me releasing my code for others to see my work.

I work in a factory and I've worked with several woman who were pregnant that should have been given paid time off but weren't. At most they get a month of work right before and after they have their child. It's sickening to see a pregnant woman do hard labor they are incapable of doing properly because they cannot be given time off. Call me a misogynist because there was a time when women didn't have to work in this country, a man could support a family of multiple children without a college degree in a big house while his wife did not work and he only had to work 40 hours a week. Women certainly should have the right to pursue a career if they so choose but married couples need a form of ubi that encourages the growth of families, the girl boss single mother capitalist mindset this country has isn't benefiting either sex. The government should give newlyweds a house and a car and a lumpsum of cash to start a family, raising kids is a job in of itself. Why must women be put through hell for having a child? Why are we so obsessed with not having children and antinatalism.

2024,I'm angry again. This feeling is familiar.,"Tomorrow I start my 13 an hour BOH position at a retail store. Never done retail before, not happy to but I made a previous post about how I applied to two retail stores (both for positions that are not cashiers or sales associates) because I need to start getting an income in to save up to move, eat, buy new shoes even. 

Having a job has always negatively contributed to my lifelong, diagnosed depression and I'm feeling the familiar feelings of anger and irritation at having to go to work. 

Especially having to go back after months of peace and tranquility. 

It is *incredibly* difficult for me to hold down a job and it's been ages since my last more-than-a-year position but I have to force myself. I need to move—where? Everywhere is expensive and I live in the mid Atlantic—, start eating a little more regularly since I'm doing more and consistently.

2040,Am I wrong to no notice/ no show after being lied to in the interview?,"
I’ll just give you bullet points- 

Recently got out of the military, first job out, private security work. 

I live 1 hour and 15 minutes away.

*****Interviewed by the franchise owner****

I said I was okay with weekends/holidays/nights or overtime occasionally

Hired on the spot under the guise of 
day time work,  full time, about 40 hours a week. 

“It’s not a hard job” exact words from the owner. 
                 

                       The reality

 all shifts are at night

All shifts are minimum 12 hours, typically 13-14 hours per day. 5:30pm-7am. 

5 days a week. 

Every day off I’ve had I’ve been asked to come in. I covered for people, felt obligated but my choice trying to be a good employee

The work is extremely dangerous at times, forced to speed all night in a busy city to make the quota. 

Also majority of places I go to are very poor and full of crime, example - tonight I saw a meth addict carrying a machete in an apartment complex. Yet I can’t carry a firearm until I paythem for the training at 1 year Mark. 


Goes against everything the military instilled in me but I got out for a damn reason right?

Wife and family wants me to quit but I wince at the idea of two more weeks...

Is this worthy of a no show and no call?

During my 30-40 years of my life I've dealt with so much harassment between family, work places, and the public. Every job I went to I had to deal with some level of harassment. Some better than others.

One of the jobs added duties like cleaning animal waste, toilets, etc, and kept lowering my pay until it was $8 a week, and I had to quit because it costed me more to work than not. I only learned some time after that there was a bet to see how miserable they could make it for me before I quit. One job I was fired on my first day on the first hours because the plant manager found out I am autistic the day prior. 

Anyways, it didn't hit me how messed up I am when I tried to do my backup plan which was to go into the military. I found out the USA military has policies against autistic people from joining. After that I started doing research because I seen people do far far far far less than me, and make it pretty far ahead in life. I found studies like 85% of us that is autistic and with degrees can't get/keep a job, only 12% of us make enough to live off of, in some areas we are 65% of the homeless, we are extremely higher likely to offing ourselves. Even more if you're high functioning.

2071,"Being a ""company man"" vs. being a degenerate gambler","I'm a big fan of this sub. It speaks pure truth. I firmly believe we are conditioned to accept horrible work culture, because the only other alternative is to starve and be completely destitute. ""They"" got you ""by the balls""

The other day I was reading a essay by a psychologist about gambling addiction. I myself do not have a gambling addiction. However, because of this I was just interested in general about the psychology and mechanics of it.

Then, it struck me. The whole structure of work culture is basically exploiting ""degenerate gamblers"". Let me explain.

You start off with next to nothing, or sometimes nothing early in life. You then commit to debt (student loans, car payment to get to work, etc.) basically you put up an initial wager.

Furthermore once you get a job you take losses caused by employers/work culture continually (emotional, physical, family relationships) you make wagers in the form of personal sacrifices in the hopes of one day ""making it big"" with a career and making more money, better job, more power, etc.

However, its a pyramid scheme. The ""good jobs"" get fewer and fewer in numbers the further you try to ""move up"". At some point you have to acknowledge that there will be more ""losers"" than winners. Basically, this spells out a huge ""house advantage"". A system that will always hold an edge over you. Just like casinos do.

People go to work. EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. And the they think ""one day ill win big if I"".... (insert whatever... work hard, tattle-tale co-workers, work for less, etc). They think one day they will ""win"" what they have been working for. Which is essentially the core of gambling addiction. Every gambling addict thinks if they play, one day it will be ""the big day"". That day never comes, the house just bleeds them dry as they sit in a delusional state of mind.

Basically, and specifically in America you continually ""put up"" what little you have to one day ""win"", however your ""winning"" and career advancement is largely just luck, and odds. Odds that are specifically stacked against you.

So, with that said are all people who are heavily invested in the ""career game"" basically degenerate gamblers and they don't even realize it?",False,ne8som,vmd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ne8som/being_a_company_man_vs_being_a_degenerate_gambler/,8,1

2074,How to handle the 'Why were all your jobs so short?' question?,"I'm a lawyer and I never thought I'd do so many jobs since graduation. I wanted to just be a lawyer, but stuff happened (heartbreak, illness). I'm too scared to say this to interviewers. I once did and the only thing they ask me is: you're not sick anymore, are you? I'm not, but jobs can make me ill quickly. 

I did about 8 jobs since 2017. Most of them were just for a definite term. I resigned from one, and I ended one mutually cause it was for indefinite term. I did plan on moving once, so I only accepted short term jobs during that period. I also like the comfort of having a job agency look for me.

But I still feel like an absolute weirdo because I have a law degree and in their eyes I let myself get treated like a high schooler. They don't understand that when you look for jobs, 2 out of 3 is for a definite term with no chance of staying longer. Companies who immediately offer a fixed contract are either sketchy or very difficult jobs like taxes, so they need to offer you all this stuff in order to keep you. Company car, all that crap.

I find the question so rude in fact, that one time I responded kinda harsh: well, that's cause all jobs are short term these days and you just have no choice. I've read about people getting burnout after 20 short term contracts, or 50 y olds not being able to get a contract for indefinite term. Social law in my country was ffed up by a socialist minister who tried to do good by getting rid of trial periods. Now every job is just a trial period after which you get dumped unless no one else wants to do these horrible jobs!

And next time if they ask me that question, if they even dare, and the job i am applying for is - tuh duh - for a definite term, I won't be shy to say: well, this job is short term too, why don't you just give a contract for indefinite term then, rather than using short term contracts as a sort of one long free trial period? Why buy the software if you keep getting free trial periods amiright? That's how they reason. 

In fact my own rant sort of gave me an answer. Cause for some reason I am pretty sure that the next job I'll apply for will be for a definite term...",False,ndimy4,Romantica1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ndimy4/how_to_handle_the_why_were_all_your_jobs_so_short/,13,1

He brought this up to his employer(including district manager) and showed them the timecard proving his work. He was then showed how on the payroll it said he didn't work 3 of the days that he had. After that he was told they will give him 8 hours.... 8 hours of pay for the 3 days!

Imagine going 100K in debt just to realize the job that you always wanted has not been given to after a decade of slaving away at other related jobs!

So I left school at 16 to start my apprenticeship. I’m from New Zealand, not sure how things work elsewhere but here on an apprenticeship your employer can give you a training wage that’s lower than minimum because they pay for your training fees. Anyway it started okay but my boss always wanted overtime and it was draining and I couldn’t do anything I wanted to do with my “ideal independent working life”. No gym, no working on my own cars, barely seeing friends. Ended up moving out of my parents home at 17 for various reasons and training wage didn’t cut it anymore. So I left (1.5 years) and got a labouring job which bumped me up to minimum wage. Only thing was it was 6 days a week dark till dark. 1 year later I left as I had NO life outside of work(1 year). So I figured hey how about nightshift, at least I’ll have time during the day, so I got a job at a driving range 10pm-7am. I guess it doesn’t work that way though so 5 months later I left. My partner and I got the same job on a film crew, on a Netflix series. Same deal, dark til dark. But we have a dog. It’s cruel to leave him inside a house for 12+ hours a day. It started alright being able to go home on breaks but locations change and hours change for filming so we left (6 months). I tried to start a business fixing up second hand cars but there was no money to be made. I was unemployed for a few months then I really needed a job so I got a manufacturing job. I worked there for 4 days and left. That was a couple weeks ago. I’m 20 now, my partner of 3.5 years and I (have been living together for around 3 years) are now expecting a baby.

2113,Honestly at this point the only way I see a good life is returning to the void.('rant'/release),"So for starters, I'm a nihilist and antinatalist. But for as long as I can remember I chose to observe the world instead of join it. This I guess is a culmination of the 16 years of my lifes observation. People say I'm just depressed or that it's just a phase. Bull. Shit.
If it were a phase wouldn't still feel these things after 7 years.

So far its shit. Not even gonna sugarcoat it.

We dont get a choice in existence, we are ripped from the void, indoctrinated into thinking life is worth living while also being fucked up the ass by wage slavery and 40 hour weeks. On top of that theres the mental and physical shit that can develop, further decreasing lifes ""worth"". From the day we are developed enough to go to school until the day we're too old to work.

People keep saying life is a gift, life is worth living, life is amazing and this and that and this and that and it just keeps going on and on and on and it never ends. It just...never ends.

You know what the definition of insanity is?
It's doing the same shit, over and over again, expecting something to change. We all work, day in and day out, expecting something to pay it all off. But it never comes. The tribulations, the indoctrination, the ignorance, the petty political infighting. And for what? A few minutes of enjoyment?! It doesn't matter, theres no point in existence now, not since slavery and feudalism were created. We are born into lives of suffering and lies.

We are told everything will work out, that everything will get better, that we should be happy to be alive.
But it never will.
It will never get better, we will die, be forgotten, and that's it. Nothing more. The ultimate end.

Thats our reward for all the time wasted working, suffering, crying - death.
P
What's the point in pushing on if the end goal is a return to the eternal void anyway?
The economy ruins our one chance at life. Life is an amazing thing to be enjoyed, but the system the people before us made ruins it for us.
It doesn't help when people say to live life to the fullest and then proceed to get forced into slavery that locks you down with cold chains and holds a blade to your throat if you dare move. 

I'm drained, your drained, they're drained, and for what? Less money that what is needed to survive on top of the plethora of mental and physical disorders we may have? Is our reward the slave owners? The final release from lifes sadistic eyes? It doesn't even matter does it. Death is the only thing guaranteed by the supposed 'lord above'. And I pray the final day of torment arrives soon. 

They say I have my whole life ahead of me, that i should enjoy it while i can because high school is the best time of my life. If this place is the best time of my life I refuse to live any longer because fuck that.
Why should I carry on huh?
WHY?
It will never get better, never be worth the suffering. Nothing will matter anyway I'll be forgotten and returned to the eternal void and cease to exist.
If i killed myself i would be free, if they say suicide only passed on the pain, those people shouldn't have decided to make another poor soul suffer the cycle anyway. I wouldn't care cause I'd be dead and free. If they killed themselves from the strain then good on them! They freed themselves too. If it fails and I unfortunately continue living, I'd be forced even deeper into the hole. Why bother anymore.

In my opinion the concept of working hard for a long time and then retiring to relax is depressing. A more logical way would be to take job breaks from time to time.

Slapping on the label of ""Essential workers” without EVER matching the requirements of an essential employee aka permanent full-time, hazard pay, time and a half OT, full benefits from healthcare to a pension, these cooperations really showed their true colors. They don’t have the automated systems necessary to replace you. They don’t have the ability to stay open without you.

2145,You'll always be someone's b-word,"I recently got my first job out of college that I begin this mid-summer. I am extremely thankful that I got this job...it's a permanent work from home job. I had to truly work for it to find this opportunity to get the offer after multiple run-ins with terrible jobs and abusive bosses. I interviewed four times until they gave me the offer. Now, two months BEFORE the first work day begins, these asshole co-workers want to schedule a few zoom meet and greets for new-hires. Seriously, the four interviews were a waste of time...now they want me to bullshit myself with a bunch of people I won't even see in person? This is the type of job where I work directly with customers and not rely on my coworkers. 

It pisses me off because even though the meeting is ""optional"" (as per them - which I know is bullshit), there is an IMMENSE pressure to meet and if I don't meet, it'll make me look bad because the managers will be there (to be fair, I don't think they scheduled this, but I there's a chance I'm wrong). I've been discriminated against for the silliest reasons (I'm socially awkward and I have a visible anxiety disorder that is apparent on my face) and I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like for other people in worse positions than I am. This anxiety gnaws at me. At first, I thought I was being irrational, but now after self-reflection, I'm beginning to see the truth. My anxiety is rational. It's rational because in the USA, we have at-will employment which means that for ANY reason, the boss can let you go. For ANY reason. Just imagine. I don't like the way you look at me or I don't like your non-talkative personality. Then I'm fired. Then I can't pay rent. I keep planning for the eventual doomsday scenario, but that would involve even more stress...As a child, I moved every 2 years because my parents couldn't afford the rent and the lease was up. I've been homeless before and reliant on other people's charity to not live in a homeless shelter. Now, I feel like working ANY job is the same concept, but a different medium. I'm reliant on someone's charity for the rest of my life until I die. It doesn't matter if you do a great job, your employer can fire you for ANY reason if you don't cater to their whims.

2192,Not glorifying overworking? How about not glorifying stress at all?,"So, where do employers get the right to cause anyone stress? I remember being a child around the year 2000 and hearing the word stress for the first time. I hated that word. People started using it as a status symbol, just like all other nasty stuff like burn out, overworking, multiple jobs, full agenda's and tuhduh drinking, smoking and slurping caffeine and eating nasty salads for lunch at a desk. 

Stress is extremely toxic to the body. And even when an employee think there is no stress, the environment is highly stressful. Opening an email can cause the same adrenal response as being attacked by z wild animal, only here, we can't escape from the animal, and we are also not allowed to kill. Our minds and bodies then produce way too much adrenaline, which needs to be countered by cortisol, either leading to obesity or to weight loss and trembling.

And it's almost like the worse employees feel and the more obvious the news is (half of the population is burned out, 8 out of 10 wants to quit jobs...) the worse the companies wanna make it. As if they feel like our limits have been pushed higher and they want to see even more how far they can stretch us.

Stress during interview, stress during commute, stress to learn everything, then more and more stress to not make a mistake either from the imposter syndrome or from the dunning kruger effect. Stress from making ends meet, stress of bad work life balance, stress of bad coworkers, stress from lack of sleep, not getting chores done, eating the same nutrient poor food every lunch derived of any salt, fat or flavour.

I have to stay on antidepressants to function and not notice the dizziness as much, and it really sucks, although I am seeing a lot of improvement. I was really depressed because this all happened right out of college, where I was supposed to start my animation career.

I feel so guilty for not having a stable job yet, when I’ve been recovering for the past 8 months. I’m lucky that I have the support to rest during this time, but I also feel like people might think I’m faking my illness so I don’t have to work, since it’s an invisible disability that no one else can see but me. I find it hard to even describe the weird sensations I deal with daily. Even a lot of doctors think it’s all in my head, it took months to find a doctor to diagnose me.

2208,We've confused work with WORK,"Doesn't even look like a real word, does it?

Well within every word there's at least one other nested inside - usually more than one. 

Within a sentence there might sometimes be more *invisible* words in-between the others than there are in the sentence itself.

This is why some people have to immediately retaliate to **Black Lives Matter** with ""uh actually *ALL loves matter sweaty 😌* - they genuinely only understand those words in the most basic and superficial terms - they're criticizing a facade without realising there's a sprawling and winding complex behind it.

^^^they ^^^dum ^^^lol

We're *all* guilty of this to some degree, but *some* particular misconceptions and misunderstandigs are not only horribly wrong, they're so horribly wrong that their mere existence poisons us all.

Like the concept of *work*.

&gt;well people have to work - we can't all just lie around all day or nothing would get done!

Of course *somebody* has to do these more menial and soul-sucking jobs until automation fully takes over for us, so if anything *these jobs should be the most highly rewarded*!

Of course we have to work - but you can't talk about work without also talking about every other idea it is inseparably entangled with - ownership, property, value, wealth, and choice to name only a few - sounds like quite the philosophical discussion, huh?

A few months ago I spent maybe 20-25 hours writing and editing a short story - that was work.

Cleaning my house and taking care of my dogs is work.

Preparing meals and going grocery shopping is work.

Maintaining a healthy relationships with my friends/family/partner is work.

Wage-slavery is work too, but it's work mutated to serve the interests of capital - to enrich the few at the expense of the many.

Wage-slavery is work absent of meaning and fulfillment - it is a [VOID](https://i.imgur.com/g683rPD.png)

If I have to work ~25 hours a week doing something boring but something that keeps society functioning I will bite that bullet.

Working 40+ hours a week to do nothing else but make my boss even richer?

Are you starting a business to implement this ideology? Adjusting your lifestyle for minimal cost of living? Setting up for retirement? Would love to hear your thoughts.


In all honesty, I'm 100% on the opposite side of this ideology. I absolutely love my job (land use planner for my hometown), I receive regular promotions/pay increases, work is 4 days on 3 days off, I worked two jobs through college and came out debt free (sucked but it was worth it in my opinion),  first person in my family to receive a 4 year degree (moms an aid with a school and dads a truck driver).  Don't get me wrong, I have absolutely no desire to work forever and have made the appropriate decisions to be retired by 45 (Im 28) but do forsee myself doing contract work while in retirement.

2264,Palantir is creepy as hell,"Maybe some of you have heard of Palantir Technologies. They had an IPO this year. They make software which integrates databases to find patterns. Useful for deterring theorists but also for listening on employees. 

The following is from Wikipedia: 

Aided by 120 ""forward-deployed engineers"" of Palantir during 2009, Peter Cavicchia III of JPMorgan used Metropolis to monitor employee communications and alert the insider threat team when an employee showed any signs of potential disgruntlement: the insider alert team would further scrutinize the employee and possibly conduct physical surveillance after hours with bank security personnel. The Metropolis team used emails, download activity, browser histories, and GPS locations from JPMorgan owned smartphones and their transcripts of digitally recorded phone conversations to search, aggregate, sort, and analyze this information for any specific keywords, phrases, and patterns of behavior.

The CEO, Alex Karp describes himself as a socialist. Said he doesn’t respect anything about Trump. However... from Wikipedia:

He has said that technology companies like Palantir have an obligation to support the U.S. military. He has defended Palantir's contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the controversy over family separations, saying that while separations are ""a really tough, complex, jarring moral issue,"" he favors ""a fair but rigorous immigration policy"". He has said the U.S. government should have a strong hand in tech regulation and that western countries should dominate AI research.",False,nd4trg,roald_1911,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nd4trg/palantir_is_creepy_as_hell/,14,1

If there's something the pandemic has taught us, its that WE hold the power of the economy, and we can just as easily decide, independently on our own, that we have some goddamn standards.

We deserve 2 months of vacation time in a year.

Maternity AND paternity leave should be standardized.

 Imagine 90%. Perhaps 95%. Or even 99%. All while management sits there with way higher salaries. How is that justified? So I decided fuck that, I will just start my own business.

I went to Lowe's a week ago to buy an air conditioner and walked a lap around the entire floor, there was literally one person in the entire store, save for cashiers and customer service. 

Now I know where shit is, but they had none on the floor, they were a good 15 feet up in the air.

So I walk up to the lady who was helping and jokingly asked if everyone was on break. I didn't know how bad this was. She nervously chuckled and paged someone over to where I needed something. 10 minutes..no one. Another page...ten minutes..no one. 

40 minutes later, someone not even in uniform appears from the garden center completely soaked in sweat (probably already soaked his uniform).

I felt so god damn bad for this dude, apparently a husband and wife came in an HOUR ago and were going back and forth on a washer and dryer pair which tied up the other person's time. I watched while he was getting my ac unit down and they literally were talking and looking like they were picking out a house, not a $1200 pair of washer and dryers.

Today, I went to a small hardware store and literally no one was on the floor. Luckily I found what I needed. 

Now I support this shit 100%, refusing work because of shit pay. But please be respectful and considerate that the ones left are stretched as thin as a hair.

Obviously I am not a lawyer or disability expert, I haven’t even applied myself yet. But several sources say if your depression is severe enough that you are unable to work, you might be able to qualify. Other qualifying mental conditions (their words, not mine) include anxiety and forms of autism.

2275,Time is our most valuable possession.,"
I’ve seen a lot of posts lately on this subreddit, as I think in the wake of this major pandemic, a lot of us have become a lot more in tune with our inner turmoil regarding where we stand societally. 

I’m 22 years old, born and raised here in the great USA. I did pretty well in school, had some cool friends, and got to take lots of vacations growing up to cool places like Hawaii and NYC. I never had food insecurity in my youth, nor did I ever have to worry about not having a roof over my head. I got my first job when I was 16, working part time at the local movie theater. I was so excited to finally be making some money, and for a first job it was pretty fun. I learned a lot about customer service, and slowly but surely I was introduced to all the spoils of my labor. With my newfound bank balance, I suddenly was able to enhance a lot of the things I enjoyed. I made my first “big purchase” after my first paycheck and bought myself a set of Copic markers, a coveted art supply by many young illustrators and artists. 

Growing up my mother always stressed that there are three M’s to live by in life, the *motivation* to *market* yourself to make *money*. Money was here to buy opportunities, not things. I pondered this a lot in my teens, starting to think a lot more about my money and what I really wanted to do with it. I still spent very frivolously for a long time, but I had at began to open the thought channels.

Fast-forward to a year into working at the movie theater, and I was still liking the job pretty well. It paid a whopping 7.25$ an hour, and I got maybe 20-25 hours a week, so I was *loaded* as far as being a teenager goes, with no bills to pay or mouths to feed. Life was cool. 

Things changed when the yearly movie theater inspection came around. It was a school night, and I had worked a full 8 hour shift after school. Our supervisor had told us that closing would take a little longer than normal that evening, as the health inspection was the following morning and some things needed to be deep cleaned. To keep a long story short, they kept us there until almost three in the morning, scrubbing the walls and deep cleaning the gutters. Upon telling them that I really needed to go home around midnight, they had said that if I chose to leave, I’d be terminated, despite the clear issues with the situation. This was my first real encounter with the insanity of the workplace. I quit the following day by no call no showing. 

My parents had expressed disappointment in me quitting at the time, however they understood why I quit and it wasn’t a huge issue. I found another job fairly quickly, but the movie theater had left a sour taste in my mouth. As I got more involved with work, I saw more and more things that just didn’t make sense to me. Sick days were okay as long as long you had 24 hour notice. Weirdly enough I didn’t have a calendar of my upcoming flus, and was penalized when I called in sick with a high fever to my job working at Panera Bread. I had tested positive for the Flu, and had all the proper documentation. They fired me. You gotta love at-will employment. 

To keep this already longer post a little shorter, I’ll say this. I’d become highly aware of the lack of humanity in the customer service/retail industry, and had become a lot less excited about the three M’s and more focused on the one T. *Time*. Was my time being well spent in these jobs? Was I doing humanity a true service?

Senior year of High school I tried acid for the first time. It was super fun, and wasn’t a super deep experience on the surface, however I strongly believe that at the young age I did it, as well as the pathways that had already started opening up in my head from my work experiences, I had begun an irreversible battle with “work”. I began questioning a lot more things, as well as becoming more and more angry with the inequalities and struggles within the average workplace. I became surprised by how much people seemed to obsess over their jobs, and was shocked by the amount of stress that came with them. It was crazy to me how much turmoil people were experiencing just so *Generic company title* could continue making bank and destroying whichever ecosystem was being threatened that week in the news.

My freshman year of college was when this really kicked into high gear. Having done well in high school and scoring a 32 on my ACT, I had gotten into every school I had applied to. I was motivated, and really wanted to pursue art as a career, because I had seen the way my art was meaningfully impacting others. My parents had always told me that as long as I did well and got into the schools I wanted to get into, that I’d have help with paying. This didn’t end up being the case. 

Art school is ridiculously expensive, and with my parents high income and my young age of 17, I did not qualify for grants, nor did I have the ability to take out school loans without a co-signer. Even with the 50 thousand dollar scholarship I got to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, it wasn’t a viable option. I ended up having to go to the state school 20 minutes from my hometown, in a town that smelled of cow shit and regret. I hated it, despite the full tuition scholarship I received there. I had been doing well in my classes, and slowly began enjoying it a bit more. I met a few friends, and began embracing the experience, after all, I was lucky to be there. 

At this point I had been doing psychedelics more regularly, and had become a lot more familiar with my inner voice, at least, I was able to be a bit more introspective than I had been previously.

My third month of college, I was involved in a hit and run accident due to a drunk driver in a stolen car. I had been a passenger in my roommates car, and the drunk driver had hit us t-bone style on my side after running through a stop sign. I was lucky. Had we been a foot further down the road, I would have been crushed. The drunk driver seemed fine, and I do remember him sort of hobbling out the car with a bottle in his hand and limping off into the night, very much like some shitty scene in a movie. I still very much remember the sensation of shock and pain of our car being hit and then crashing into a pole, smoke filling the cabin and flames erupting from the engine. I was so scared to move, and the next thing I knew I was on the street 30 feet away from the car. I had blacked out and some bystanders had pulled me out while the flames grew larger. I’m very fortunate that outside of the concussion and cuts and bruises, I was okay. 

I dropped out of college shortly after, having had difficulty with focusing on class following the accident. I became very depressed, stopped eating, and stopped doing artwork. My parents had just gotten divorced, and upon telling them I was dropping out, they wished me luck and sent me off into the world on my own. I get their frustration with me leaving such an “opportunity” but the three *M’s* yet again were turned by the one *T*, Time. 

In the 5 years since, I have worked over 10 jobs, lived in my car, taught English in Costa Rica, was a ski instructor, traveled cross country living in my SUV, and consistently I have been VERY broke. My dad is no longer a part of my life, he has been living in Hawaii for the past few years, and we haven’t spoke. My mom has occasionally been there for me in times of struggle, and I even moved back in with her when I threw my back out working at Whole Foods, which required a back surgery that was not covered by workmans comp due to my short tenure there. 

Despite all these great ups and downs, I have consistently been labeled as a failure by my mother. A failure to launch, a failure to commit, and failure to grow. I’ve done a ton mental gymnastics trying to explain myself, to reach understanding, and to be heard in a meaningful way. 

At this point, I’m absolutely tired of being taken advantage of by companies just because of my “financial desperation”. It’s EXPENSIVE to have a job. First off, you need money to buy gas to get to work, and if your home isn’t very close, you need money for your car and the repairs it will need from commuting every day. You need money to pay the obnoxiously high rent that ends up being more than have your income, and you need money to feed yourself. Save money? If you’re lucky enough, you might be able to put away 100$ a month, but probably not, because if you can’t afford to treat yourself even a little, you’ll probably erode to the point of not being able to work anyways. 

So I guess this post is really just me trying to say Fuck it. I’m done trying to change MY inner flame just so I can help make sure that the corporations actively killing our planet, lobbying our rights away, and herding the average American into whether slavery can continue to prosper. 

I’m tired, and I’m choosing me over them. And you should too. Quit that fucking job. Make them hurt. Make them realize that without us, they’re nothing. Otherwise nothing is going to change. I’m not “lazy” and I’m not unwilling to work. I’m unwilling to be a commodity to be bought and sold for pennies on the dollar. I want to spend my time focusing on real issues. People all around the globe are being Slaughtered in modern day holocausts, I can’t spend my time focused on wether or not Linda is satisfied with her chicken Cobb salad or Bob is going to come back after he wasn’t satisfied with the experience he had at the Whole Foods deli counter.

2277,"How School and Work, Actually Work","I detest working. It's so horrible. It makes me so miserable. I think we all can relate.

I think I understands why. This also explains how school works as well.

Do you remember during school, before big exams, midterms, projects - you feel a lot of stress and anxiety. It builds up until you finish taking that exam or finish that project. Then it FEELS like you are happy afterwards. But I think it is important to note what is really actually happening.

You only FEEL good because you are eliminating that stressful event from your life. It's not that taking the exam itself makes you feel good. It only feels good to eliminate the stress and anxiety that you had shortly experienced beforehand. 

I think a lot of people mistake this and think that doing stuff will actually lead to happiness but often times, it is purely the elimination of the negative state that feels good and is not an actual pleasurable experience itself. 

This leads to work, of course. People always claim working makes them feel better, etc. But really I think work generates in them all these negative states. Anxiety, stress, frustration, anger, etc. Thus, when they finally reach the weekend it's TGIF! Right???!

People think working is fulfilling them but really all that happens is this generation of pain from work (which we all know too well) and elimination of that stress when projects complete, days complete, weekends come, etc.

The problem is that the cycle just happens over and over and over again. I think that leads all of us to be very miserable people. No longer does the pain elimination from completing anything feel good anymore. It's just constantly starting back over again with a new day of work, over and over again, and it is maddening. 

I think this provides insight into how some people ""mistake"" work as being rewarding, and how many on this SUBREDDIT DO NOT AGREE. A lot of people live in that pain and pain elimination cycle and thus think finishing a hard day of work makes them happy, but really it's just being done with the bullshit that day that is giving them a sense of relief. They make the mistake of pain reduction being pleasure, but it is really just pain reduction, and that's all.",False,nc8cx4,Pessimist001,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nc8cx4/how_school_and_work_actually_work/,2,1

I’m salaried so I have the option to plan my budget 12+ month out to the explicit dollar, knowing exactly what my bank account balance should be in that time.

Not really sure what the point of the sub is, or the end goal really. This planet is doomed, big brother has won. There will never be a revolution large enough to topple the 1%.

2303,Should I quit ?,"I get paid 3 dollars an hour ,in India, as a resident doctor .I work in a single doctor setup in a rural area ,where I see roughly 40 patients a day including casualty,over 8 hrs.I see fever cases too,most of whom are covid suspects .I have no health insurance or life insurance from my workplace ...only perk is I'm provided a 200 sq feet duty room to stay in and meals. I also see emergencies off duty.During the first wave I worked with a pair of reusable cloth mask,I had to wash  them and use on alternate days, due to a shortage of surgical masks.Now, I get N95 masks, but nothing else by way of PPE.

If I quit and work in a bigger setup in the city where my family lives ,I'll get paid the around 4 dollars an hour  and I won't be on call for emergencies.I won't get accommodation and I'll have to stay at home post shift, putting my parents at risk.Getting a house on rent is difficult as a Doctor currently. I might get PPE ,I might get health insurance, depending on place of work. 

My family is upper middle class, we are not dependent on my income for sustenance.

What really riles me up is, fever cases really spiked post the election. If I am to get covid ,I will not get an oxygen bed .All covid hospitals have dedicated beds reserved for the politically connected and VIPs. If I fall sick,I will have to quarantine at home and my family will have to care for me.Another thing that doesn't make sense to me is, if a patient dies, we get beat up but no one questions their local MLA as to why less than 2 percent of our GDP is spent on Healthcare infrastructure. Since covid ,the govt has increased the budget ,on paper ,by including sanitation under Healthcare. Let's not get into the sham that is PMCARES.

My endgame is to leave the country eventually. I heard it's the healthcare is the same abroad but I'll take my chances .

Film school sounded great too. I have an abundance of natural talent that I feel has been wasted. Instead of going to art school, my parents shot me down saying to get a real job, to go into nursing or welding. I chose drones because I thought I'd have an edge in photography at least since I didn't get to do what I originally wanted. I also hate the STEM crowd.

I’m not sure if anyone remembers but I had posted here in January about being fired from the barbershop I worked at for refusing to raise the prices of my services. My post blew up a bit and I received a ton of awesome support. I ended up deleting that account because...idk I’m crazy and paranoid. Can’t find the post to link here unfortunately. Anyways on to the “update.”

So I finally filed my taxes today and ended up owing $400. I was recommended to report the business for classifying us an independent when we were treated as employees. I haven’t been working due to some bullshit irl. I’m starting school for mortuary science on Monday (thanks again for all of the support and kind words with that!!)

I wanted to wait until my taxes were filed to report them because...once again, paranoid. So I go to file an SS-8 or whatever it is. I have it all filled out and ready to go then I realize it’s not going to be an anonymous report. The owners of the business are former attorneys. I would be absolutely fucked if I reported them and they found out. I’m already struggling as is, and I can’t deal with them suing me. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to proceed? Can I do anything? I want them taken down so they can’t take advantage of other people. My friend that works there stopped talking to me as soon as I got fired, I was hoping to get her in on it but obviously I did something wrong in her eyes and I can no longer trust her.

Well within every word there's at least one other nested inside - usually more than one. 

Within a sentence there might sometimes be more *invisible* words in-between the others than there are in the sentence itself.

This is why some people have to immediately retaliate to **Black Lives Matter** with ""uh actually *ALL loves matter sweaty 😌* - they genuinely only understand those words in the most basic and superficial terms - they're criticizing a facade without realising there's a sprawling and winding complex behind it.

^^^they ^^^dum ^^^lol

We're *all* guilty of this to some degree, but *some* particular misconceptions and misunderstandigs are not only horribly wrong, they're so horribly wrong that their mere existence poisons us all.

Like the concept of *work*.

&gt;well people have to work - we can't all just lie around all day or nothing would get done!

Of course *somebody* has to do these more menial and soul-sucking jobs until automation fully takes over for us, so if anything *these jobs should be the most highly rewarded*!

Of course we have to work - but you can't talk about work without also talking about every other idea it is inseparably entangled with - ownership, property, value, wealth, and choice to name only a few - sounds like quite the philosophical discussion, huh?

A few months ago I spent maybe 20-25 hours writing and editing a short story - that was work.

Cleaning my house and taking care of my dogs is work.

Preparing meals and going grocery shopping is work.

Maintaining a healthy relationships with my friends/family/partner is work.

Wage-slavery is work too, but it's work mutated to serve the interests of capital - to enrich the few at the expense of the many.

Wage-slavery is work absent of meaning and fulfillment - it is a [VOID](https://i.imgur.com/g683rPD.png)

The task was lifeless and I would just scan, scan, scan, for hours. The boss would give me little jobs to do like refill the gum tray or wipe down the till if it got quiet. 

The customers were mostly okay. A nice mix between workers, alcoholics, students, and a couple of strays who wanted to talk to someone.

Every hour there felt like three.

To make it through I would grab a bottle of wine from near the tills and tell the boss I needed the bathroom. I'd skulk out to the bathroom, take a seat and open it up, and let all in.

After that it all felt easier. 

The mindless tasks felt somewhat more challenging. Plus it gave me a thrill to see if I'd get caught.

2367,Got a 4 week notice while WFH...,"I was working as a copywriter for a bank. Actually I'm a lawyer so I felt out of place. I thought I was doing really well though. Only got some remarks in the beginning. 

But it was my first time WFH since corona and it felt so dystopian. I had to join online meetings with a team I had never met and they all had their webcams off. It was based in Brussels and all the meetings were in French and I was new so I had no idea what it was all about. They didn't really involve me or ask me much. 

Now after 3 months thinking my work was fine, I got a 4 week notice all of a sudden. Apparently my translations were too literal (I don't agree with that at all, my text read like you would speak them, I'm Dutch btw, not English native speaker), but I wasn't proactive enough either. The latter I can understand. Corona and the desaffective feeling WFH creates, drained me, took all my motivation and made me severely depressed. It took me ages to translate a simple text.

So now I am supposed to WFH another 4 weeks with people I never met, doing work I'm not perfect at (even though I don't know what I am doing wrong) and I have to join meetings without video on knowing no one will greet me or involve me like before. Very odd system. The manager, a woman, was nagging a lot though during those meetings, I heard. She wasn't a nice person. 

I'm a bit angry and disappointed in them. But I didn't like the work anyway. I feel like just turning on the laptop and let them talk and just go outside and do some gardening... I don't know... and see if any work still gets sent? Or maybe I should not log into that meeting? I'm scared of getting questions from the ""coworkers"" about me leaving cause it would be the first and last time they ask me anything and that's so hypocritical and sad... 

I'm gonna look for a legal job again and in the meantime study for something else. I want to be a music teacher. I hate office jobs and the smelled it.",False,ncg1d1,Romantica1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ncg1d1/got_a_4_week_notice_while_wfh/,5,1
2368,How to convince my employer to let me change to a 4 day week?,"I have been working for a law firm for 2.5 years and have been in my current role for 18 months. Before COVID we worked from home for 2 days a week, I have been working from home permanently since the pandemic started. Like many of you I hate the concept of having to work and would like to change from 5 days 9-5 to 4 days 8-6. I feel I can still complete all the work required in this schedule and am generally amongst top 3 or 4 (we have monthly targets) in a 10 person team so my manager doesn't have any issues with my work.

I discussed this with my manager who says I have to put in a formal flexible working request (only 1 allowed every 12 months) and it would be dealt with by the department manager. I asked her to have an informal chat with the department manager regarding the chances of this potentially being agreed and it doesn't sound good, my manager was more understanding of how I felt and said she had been looking for other jobs herself for similar reasons. However the department manager had mentioned things like ""well we'd all like to do that"" to my manager which obviously indicates a person who sees nothing in this change for herself, I'm 90% sure it will be rejected but would still want to try. I had mentioned it would be more beneficial for my mental health but the department manager had just mentioned stuff like mental health resources and how can the company help me seemingly thinking I'm just going through a phase here.

So there will be a skype meeting with the department manager and 1 or 2 others where I will have to argue my case for why a 4 day week but would benefit me. The only 2 other people on my team who work 4 days do so because of childcare arrangements and it seems like this will be used against me as my employer not deeming me to have sufficient reason to work the same hours in 4 days. In the meeting I will have to explain things like:
- how will 4 days help me and what can the company do to help me
- how I'm going to accommodate my work (has no effect on my work, I don't take incoming calls on 1 day per week anyway and as all our work is done online I would still be working the same hours)
- how will it affect rest of my team (same as above, we have individual caseloads, I would still be working all my own files)

2370,Capitalism and Addiction,"""Get a rat and put it in a cage and give it two water bottles. One is just water, and one is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drugged water and almost always kill itself very quickly, right, within a couple of weeks. So there you go. It’s our theory of addiction.

Bruce comes along in the ’70s and said, “Well, hang on a minute. We’re putting the rat in an empty cage. It’s got nothing to do. Let’s try this a little bit differently.” So Bruce built Rat Park, and Rat Park is like heaven for rats. Everything your rat about town could want, it’s got in Rat Park. It’s got lovely food. It’s got sex. It’s got loads of other rats to be friends with. It’s got loads of colored balls. Everything your rat could want. And they’ve got both the water bottles. They’ve got the drugged water and the normal water. But here’s the fascinating thing. In Rat Park, they don’t like the drugged water. They hardly use any of it. None of them ever overdose. None of them ever use in a way that looks like compulsion or addiction. There’s a really interesting human example I’ll tell you about in a minute, but what Bruce says shows that both the right-wing and left-wing theories of addiction are wrong. So the right-wing theory is it’s a moral failing, you’re a hedonist, you party too hard. The left-wing theory is it takes you over, your brain is hijacked. Bruce says it’s not your morality, it’s not your brain; it’s your cage. Addiction is largely an adaptation to your environment.

We’ve created a society where significant numbers of our fellow citizens cannot bear to be present in their lives without being drugged, right? We’ve created a hyperconsumerist, hyperindividualist, isolated world that is, for a lot of people, much more like that first cage than it is like the bonded, connected cages that we need.

The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection. And our whole society, the engine of our society, is geared towards making us connect with things not people. If you are not a good consumer capitalist citizen, if you’re spending your time bonding with the people around you and not buying stuff—in fact, we are trained from a very young age to focus our hopes and our dreams and our ambitions on things we can buy and consume. And drug addiction is really a subset of that.""

2405,DAE Feel Uncomfortable Submitting to a Drug Test for an Employer?,"I just turned down a job for an employer in a state where weed is completely illegal, even for therapy. Therapy maybe for veterans can't even happen there. So I tried to rationalize with HR prior to it, like ""if I show you that the use has been recommended by a doctor, can we have a conversation about its legitimacy?"" 

""No, it's black and white in the manual.""

""Ok, bye."" 

But is bodily autonomy not valued in our country? You have a right to privacy, and why should your employer, who is likely getting your labor at a discount, also get unfettered access to see what's in your body, for free? 

In this case they did drug tests to show their clients they have a ""robust safety program."" And to save on their insurance. Of course they don't tell the employees they do that, they also don't strictly tell them that if they were to get injured on the jobsite, the first priority for them would be to get access to your bodily fluids so that they can see if they can blame you for the accident that may have jeopardized your life. ""Oh, he did blow, this pipe falling on his head was his fault."" Again, for insurance to be cheaper. 

It's like employers are telling them to cover a certain cost for them. If you add up what they save on insurance and the revenue from the client they've gained for drug testing, and divide that by the number of employees (possibly weighted by however you want to measure importance), you'd get the cost that each employee contributes to the company. Why are they not also being compensated for that? 

Lastly, I informed them I'd do the job on a 1099 basis or as an independent contractor so they could get the employee doing the work (the reason they *told* me they wanted to hire me was because I was the best fit), but we could get around that pesky drug test requirement. Hard no from them. So, did they actually want me to do the job because I'd get it done, or did they want to be able to completely control the person they put in that position and thought I'd be the best fir to be controlled? 

I'm certain other parts of the world think it would be absurd to provide bodily fluids to an employer so they can gauge how much they can trust you.

Now everyone is working longer than ever and burnout and stress have become a misplaced status symbol. Some useful idiots work on 3 screens at once, cause it's more efficient? Working on a pc also never felt efficient to me. Outlook sound also gives me pmdd, literally, cause it's always full of shit. I had several jobs where I had to print each and every email as later proof in case a client starting disputing... it made some coworkers paranoid so much that some emails were in the file 10 times, cause every time a new exchange was added to the thread, they printed the entire thread... cause boomers! I feel like pcs have actually added a lot of unnecessary time wasting and administration. Because of smartphonesit, job agencies expect you to digitally sign weekly contracts on your way to work on a monday morning, duh, if not, you are not insured for accidents on your commute. How is that legal? I can't sign while driving, that would cause... accidents! I fucking hate technology. Thinking of switching to becoming a high school teacherd and man I'd collect all smartphones as a rule first things before class. I'd also try to indoctrinate the kids into picking a job that does not involve offices cause it is 100% screentime now. Screens also cause vit D and melatonine issues. How... can ... this... be... legal? My shoulder muscle is also fucked cause of desks. A lot of pcs are too low for me. And during corona i was supposed to do a zoom call and i found out last minute there were no microphones or webcams... boss complained that we were strugglers and client complained we were amateurs. We weren't, we found a way to zoom with them on a smartphone, all sitting around it the 4 of us, sad! I looked into becoming neoludite. But we can unfortunately never undo this internet plague... We can only choose wisely for the future if maybe we should do a job that involves pc or not. Don't get me started on printers, fax, endless e-mails on how bad emails are for the environment, online registrations and uploading, zoom call, teams, skype, cisco, FML.

2422,I really HATE having to make money. Please end this madness immediately!!,"I'm a certified massage therapist and I've been doing this for 7 years. This industry is so up and down like a goddamn roller coaster and the pay is so unstable if I knew about this before going to massage school I wouldn't have wasted my time and I would have just gone back to University and got in my biochemistry degree. I went to massage school because I thought I could make a good living and put myself through University to get my biochemistry degree so that I can get a real career making real money. I was highly mistaken.

So just recently in the last few weeks I quit my weekend job at this chain corporate Spa because I was absolutely sick and tired of getting paid only about $15 per hour after taxes and before tips. People don't even tip that well there. I put out a bunch of ads and I have gone independent charging up to $125 for a one hour massage depending on what sort of customizations the client wants. I have a portable massage table and I do outcalls at the client's homes and in calls at my home. I made $1,000 cash under the table in the first week and a half but I'm really afraid that that was just good luck because this week is not as busy and a few people have had to cancel because they either contact me too late in the day and they don't fucking understand that you should book a damn massage in advance (like they will literally contact me at 10:00 p.m. asking for a massage right now like are you fucking serious? These people have no respect for my time), or they ask me if I give happy endings or do anything extra like that which I don't, or they don't want to wear a mask when they come to my house. I seriously shouldn't have to deal with this bullshit. Clients don't respect my time, clients don't want to wear a damn mask, and all the asshole clients that asked me about erotic services. 

So yeah I'm just sick and tired of having to make bullshit money. I could enjoy this a lot more if I didn't have to worry about having to make money. Biden needs to hurry up and give me my fucking universal basic income already. I want to go back to real school (trade school is bullshit) and get my damn degree so I can have more options for jobs other than shitty massage jobs. Before I got licensed for massage back in 2014, I was doing retail and food service jobs and I don't have any other qualifications and I would rather commit suicide than go back to working in retail and food service so I'm kind of stuck with this massage career that I'm extremely disappointed with. 

So yeah I have my own business now but it's bullshit. I feel like I have to market myself more than I'm actually doing actual massage. And then I have to deal with bullshit from clients. Really shouldn't have to be dealing with any of this.",False,nbuqss,Spottedtea,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nbuqss/i_really_hate_having_to_make_money_please_end/,2,1

2430,Fuck busywork,"I got into an argument today with a few coworkers. I work in a union weld shop. A couple of the guys were giving me shit for doing a mediocre at best paint job on some metal grating. Why is a welder painting metal grating you ask? You’re not alone. I’m so sick of being the guy, and mad for others, who are the ones who have to do shit jobs because schedulers or supervisors and so on can’t bring work in at a flow rate that keeps me welding. And honestly sometimes doing shit jobs and housekeeping really are necessary for me to do my actual job of welding. But not repainting metal fucking grating. Something that’s walked on daily. Something that looked the exact same for the year I worked in that building but was totally good enough to run several jobs on. The only reason it was being painted was because they don’t have work right now. If that platform was scheduled out for another 100 years that shit would never see another coat of paint. As I went into my similar rant with my union brothers they were not happy with my work ethic. They continued to bring up that the busy work is how they justify my pay. FALSE! We build a product and sell it for x amount of dollars. That x amount pays for my wage and benefits and all the other happy horseshit that goes into running a business. If I’m not doing my actual job I’m not making the company money welding things together. Why do they have to “justify” my pay for being there. I did the work for my pay. I’m sick of pretending to be busy so some supervisor or general manager thinks shit is getting done. It’s a weird flex by my union brothers to feel that it’s the company’s right to have me or anyone else do bullshit work. It’s actually wasting company resources to have me run through paint like it’s no ones business. For shit that doesn’t matter. To keep me “busy” to justify my pay. So now I’m disgruntled. You think when I do finally get a job to do I’m gonna give it my all just to be relegated back to bitch duty? Absolutely fucking not. How the hell did we come to this ass backwards society where I’m expected to be prideful of my floor sweeping ability’s for the paycheck I already earned creating the product they already sold.

the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we

2450,Antiwork has nothing to do with socialism,"I'm annoyed that the dominant narrative in this subreddit is from a socialist perspective.

Socialism is defined as the worker's revolution. Socialists believe that value is tied to work instead of capital. ""He who does not work does not eat"" was an official motto of the Soviet Union. In a commune, members are expected to work.

Antiwork on the other hand is the belief that the majority of work available today is unfulfilling and non self actualising. Antiworkers refuse to work not because their pay is not high enough, but because the jobs they work have no emotional value.",False,nbovmm,Fieryshit,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nbovmm/antiwork_has_nothing_to_do_with_socialism/,5,1

I’d say it’s fair to have to go through qualifications and gain community experience to earn that ticket.

2496,My experience over the last two months looking for a high-paying IT job.,"I don’t have any memes to share, but I want to share what I’ve been going through over the last two months. My company closed due to Covid and it was a big shame because I absolutely loved working there. It was a very relaxed environment. I brought my dog to work and I liked every single person I worked with. I’m still friends with most of them. 

I work in IT and I have over 15 years of experience. I am by no means a guru, but I’m pretty competent, I get things done, and I’m a very hard worker. I refuse to work OT and I only work one or two days a month in the evenings to do certain updates that cannot be done during business hours. That’s pretty standard for IT. Are you fused to work for a company where I have to come in in the middle of the night because somethings going down and has to be working by morning. No amount of money is worth my work life balance and the time I spend with my dog and family. 

So over the last few months, I’ve had a ton of interviews. Most of them were absolutely awful. These assholes just looked at me across the screen as a computer, asked technical questions, trying to trick me, to trip me up, and to embarrass myself. A few of the decent interviews that I aced were with companies who are not willing to pay a fair wage. After they made an offer to me, I tried to negotiate, but it was nothing but lowball offers. When I look at the job descriptions, most of them list things that would require in a typical environment and in normal times maybe five or six people to perform. They are looking for a system engineer, a network engineer, a VMWare engineer, a cloud engineer, and like 20 other things all wrapped up in one individual. And then they post the salary of $70,000. That type of position should pay at least $125,000 per  year. In Los Angeles, where I live, such a position should pay at least $140,000 per year. And these fucking greedy cunts want to pay $70,000 max. On the other hand, I just got a job offer that I declined from a hedge fund in Century City that was willing to pay me whatever the fuck I wanted, but the job included white glove VIP service to C level execs, so basically I had to bend over and let them abuse me as much as they want. They can’t find anybody who is willing to work that kind of a job so they are looking for anyone who’s desperate enough and are willing to pay through the roof. The greed is out of control. I’m so offended that I really just want to leave the United States. I was born in the USSR and came to America as a child, and I’m NOT promoting communism or socialism in any way shape or form, but I’m ready for some Canadian type of Socialism, Israeli type of Socialism, Scandinavian and Australian type of socialism. I fucking hate American corporate capitalism more than I hate anything else.

2510,I can't do it anymore - Depressive realism has killed my ambition completely,"Well, TLDR basically in the title. A personal rant.

I'm in my early thirties and just can't muster the energy or motivation to keep going anymore. Office jobs or anything that is likely to bring much stress in particular have brought me down severly in these last 10 years.

After telling my boss last year I'd gladly quit the job (finance customer service) if it was not for the fact that then I'd get zero unemployment benefits, he fired me a couple months back. So I got paid out  and am now getting the equivalent of 70% of my last paycheck as unemployment benefits. (yay, Europe!) He likely assumed I was too big of a risk on team morale anyway since I'd also been on sick leave two times due to (lifelong) depression. Obviously working customer service for two years didn't help me much.

It's all not for lack of trying. I've studied, even got a postgraduate which I finished as first in class before many other ""high achievers"", because on paper I liked the subject and was highly motivated about it. I also tried regular less demanding office jobs before that bored me to death and after that went into finance consulting briefly. It all drained me completely. I dreaded selling my time, but mostly hated acting like I felt I belonged and liked being there. I understand work is not necessarily supposed to be fun but I'd also prefer not to get suicidal over it. As silly as it might sound to some, it has been my reality frequently. Obviously believing that in the end nothing matters just to cope with shit doesn't help either. 

There is nothing natural about the stress most jobs bring us and the content of these jobs is so far from what any normal person should deem interesting. Who the fuck likes eyeballing excel, SAP, jargon filled e-mails, ... all day?! Not to mention office politics, dress code, bullshit management and clients, ... It feels so absurdly dystopian to me that I often have a hard time wrapping my head around it. I wish I had an OFF-button to zombie through life, to act like it's all meaningful. There is no viable opt-out in our modern world and we're all wage slaves. Some just get slightly more expensive toys in return for not questioning the absurdity of it all.

Lately I've done some job hunting again and more often than not you get absolute bullshit stories about what work you are going to do versus the actual reality and pay is terrible to boot. I can't see another ""work hard, play hard"" posting anymore. So i've decided ""I'm done"" with really trying. I'll just go from temp job to temp job, with long breaks in between, realizing I'm incredibly lucky at least to live in a country where unemployment benefits are strong and to have a financially strong background. I'll just assume I'm an early adopter of Universal Basic Income!

2520,"Wages and costs, Inflation is the problem","Everyone has a right to be frustrated with the low wages compared to the costs of living. Minimum wage has been stuck at 7.25 an hour for over a decade, right? And just in the last year the cost of a pound of cheese has doubled. Price increases are happening in every sector. It’s no coincidence that these price increases are coming after the government printed trillions of dollars. Inflation is happening. And it has been happening for years and will continue to happen.

At one time $7.25/hr was enough. Hell, at one time $2.00/hr was enough. The more money that is printed, the more prices go up and the less that $7.25 will get you. Inflation is the problem here.

Silver is the answer. In 2009 when the minimum wage was raised to $7.25/hr that much money could get you half an ounce of silver. Today, people want to raise the minimum wage to $15/hr. Interestingly enough, $15 dollars today can get you about half an ounce of silver. Silver is a store of value and a hedge against inflation. It has been used as real money for thousands of years. Opt out of US dollars and buy silver to preserve whatever wealth you have.

A return to the gold standard with silver as the common currency would stabilize the balance of wages and costs. It’s not up to the government to decide what gets used as money, it’s up to the people. We the people. Buy an ounce of silver every week. Whatever you can afford. Treat it like a savings account. Convert your savings into silver. Silver is real money and a silver stack is real wealth.

2524,I discovered this week that my job is required to pay me for my lunch breaks.,"I'll try not to make this too long, but basically we had an all staff meeting during which one of our supervisors complained about employee attendance, taking extended breaks, lunch going over an hour and whatnot. He made a comment about how they are not required to even give us lunch breaks, presumably to strike some sort of fear about our ""privileges"" being revoked. I was, unfortunately, fairly sure this was true, because we are in Ohio and our state labor laws are fucked. I decided to follow up on this anyway, and found several articles outlining lunch break requirements in our state. While he was correct about lunch breaks not being required, I stumbled upon this:

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Under federal law, employers must pay for hours worked, including certain time that an employer may designate as “breaks.” For example, if an employee has to work through a meal, that time must be paid. A receptionist who must cover the phones or wait for deliveries during lunch must be paid for that time, as must a paralegal who eats lunch at her desk while working or a repair person who grabs a quick bite while driving from one job to the next.""

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I work for a college facilities department as the mailroom/shipping manager (and sole employee in that area). I am also the only switchboard operator, meaning I generally eat lunch at my desk since I have to deal with phone calls and incoming deliveries. In addition, I  run the campus store out of the same area, and try to keep it open as much as I can. I emailed this to both my bosses and HR, and HR confirmed that yes, I am correct, and the college must pay me for my lunch breaks as I am not fully relieved of duty during that time. Of course, this means I've provided this organization with hundreds of hours of free labor over the last few years. I'm not expecting back pay since we have no money, but I am now claiming my lunch hour as time worked and leaving an hour earlier. I am also in talks with our community manager about starting a campus-wide workers' rights information campaign. She wants to bring in a union expert to help out.

&amp;#x200B;

The truly hilarious thing about this to me is that, had my boss not felt the need to make that comment, I never would have looked into it, and would still be providing free labor.

Know your rights.

wear business casual wear (black slack

There are needs at all times; however

Doesn't matter if it's your wife, husband, child....that's it.  Three days paid, two unpaid.  And then you start getting penalized.  

What a fucking joke.  How did we allow this to happen?  

A coworkers fucking 10 year old kid passed away last Sunday.  On MOTHERS DAY.  She has to be back at work in four days.  The wake isn't even until tomorrow, and the funeral on Saturday.  But she needs to be at work Monday morning if she doesn't want to start getting penalized.  


I have a lot of other coworkers who are straight up bootlickers.  I said to them how much it's bullshit, and their response was, ""Well, I think it will be good for her to come back to work.  It will help take her mind off things.""

What the fuck kind of empathy is that.  We work in a fucking factory that makes a specific luxury product.  Working on a fucking assembly line is suppose to make someone ""feel better"" two days after watching their 10 year old kid be lowered into the ground?

2545,Actually you are entitled to a job that pays at least satisfactorily in America/Western countries,"Western countries (America being a prominent example) have sold themselves as a place where with sufficient labour you can live at least a comfortable existence. Comfortable means you can afford the necessities such as housing, food, education, utilities and with enough left over for sufficient leisure. That is one of the key ideas of the 'American Dream' or \[insert your western country\] dream. 

Western countries still advertise themselves as this. But hang on, if there's more and more people being homeless, more and more people barely scraping by, the middle class slowly evaporating so you only really have a binary have or have not class; many people are going to question if the dream is still real. The last thing you want people to do is wake up. If enough people are falling down that you can't hide it anymore; that's when everyone starts to wake up. California is a good example of this, with many other places soon to follow in suit. 

So to keep the dream going everyone is actually entitled to a sufficient paying job to live comfortably. Otherwise western countries will need to change their advertising as a dream for the minority and a nightmare for the majority. If they're honest like that, then I guess yes you ain't entitled to a reasonable job; you can decide if you want to live there. 

So Boomers telling Millennials they're not entitled to a good job is a really dumb idea; especially if they're relying on the younger generations for their healthcare and social security. But of course ol Boomers think that they're the only ones who should get the sunshine. Others exist just to please them.

I just want to ask everyone, what stops us? Who is coming between us banding together? We are beautiful souls wanting to spend the better of our lives happy. Why should we not be heard? Why should we wait for an opportune moment?

I think the future is fuel, not an opportunity. I am half afraid to send something like this because I will look like a fool to you people. But that is a token of honesty that I think is reflected by the fear of not being a cog in the bigger society, and us feeling as though we're on the brink of suffocation. But I piece together silly words to maybe show you, together we can string together something simple. Because it doesn't have to be complex. It just has to be an honest first step from all of us, for all of us.

And I apologize for this portion in advance because I don't know if this will resonate with anyone, but I think back to what's been going on with HK and with Jan 6. and with the current middle eastern conflict, and other very similar bells that have been rung and I think to myself: We are one people are we not? We ALL bleed red and love one another. I say all of this because I hope my words are heard but aren't ever twisted. I may be no one, but I think those like me are happy being no ones. And maybe together we'll all be able to achieve a life simpler than what we have, right?  We should all work together to not be divided by those whose pockets are directly lined by that same divination. 

I hope this comes off sincere. It's so much exhaustion and stress and sadness and it cant be put anywhere else. I think maybe this is a naive request, that change is done for tomorrow, that I should plant the trees for my children. But is it selfish for me to want to be a part of a better society too?

2564,Hobbies/passions are just distant memories,"To preface this rant, I'm not saying I think everything should be free/cost pennies, as I'm sure all the dumbass bootlickers who regularly frequent this sub would no doubt assume. No, my main beef is having so many hobbies and things I actually am passionate about, yet not being able to afford to really pursue them to the level required for, at the very least, competence. There's also the issue of being unmotivated due to the soul-crushing nature of the 9-5 grind and the inevitable sapping of 90% of your mental/physical energy, but that's another rant entirely. No, what I really get pissed at is how fucking expensive anything you actually want to pursue that isn't a ""job"" is.

Everything you make with the shit wages that 95% of workers makes goes towards things like not starving/living on the street/dying of a random, easily-treatable disease. It leaves you no room to actually pursue anything you're interested in, especially if you're ""unlucky"" enough to be interested in hobbies that require a lot of money towards specific equipment. For me, as a musician who wants to pursue multiple instruments, that entails a fucking SHITLOAD of expenses towards gear that isn't shit and won't break down in a few years. I have wanted, for many years now, to get a drum kit. My main interest in drumming is metal, which explodes the price of even a basic kit exponentially. There is just no fucking way I will ever be able to afford that with having to prioritize food and housing and amenities and car repairs and all the other bullshit that ultimately you only need so you can continue fucking working to pay for the ability to continue fucking working. I've been playing guitar since I was 13, the gear I've accumulated up to now is worth tens of thousands of dollars, and most of that was gifted to me because I was lucky enough to have a supportive family. And that's just one hobby. I am a creative person. I am passionate about being a creative person. Being creative=everything you are passionate about being insanely expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

I dunno, this turned into sort of a directionless rant. It just fucking pisses me off that things that I feel should be basic human rights (food, housing, etc.) are expensive, but ONLY to the point of making it so you can either choose to eat or pursue the things you love. You want to be a musician/artist/writer? Then STARVE, fucker, or else put it all on the back burner and drown your sorrows in alcohol so you can forget about how much you miss all the shit you used to love doing, back when you were young and naive and stupid enough to think it would ever amount to anything.

Fuck this insane fucking society. Fuck this garbage work culture. Fuck the 40 hour week. Fuck getting tossed scraps from the results of the sacrifice of most of your life and time while some rich piece of shit gets richer off of it. Fuck all the morons who say that's ""just the way it is"" and perpetuate this ridiculous, clown-ass, suicide-inducing cycle of utter sociopathy. I just want to fucking do what I love, but at this point I don't even remember how it feels to enjoy any of the things I used to enjoy. It's like looking back on someone else's life, like I'm watching a fucking grainy, sepia-tone VHS tape that was printed from memories I didn't even know I still had.

(I know it's based off last year's income or whatever which i also think is stupid because what the fuck does that have to do with what i'm making right now.) But now i'm being forced to full-time? So where's the fucking 3 weeks worth of $600 pandemic checks that's supposed to compensate for my reduced hours? Did I just fucking work those 3 weeks for nothing? Those paychecks I got those weeks wasn't even enough to cover a trip to the fucking grocery store. Will I see that money or am I supposed to just lick their boots and go back to full-time even though my whole fucking department isn't back yet bc THEY'RE STILL ON FURLOUGH. I ASKED THE HR DUDE ABOUT THIS AND ALL HE CAN TELL ME THAT IT'S A ""BUSINESS DECISION"" LOL OKAY. ALSO WHY DO THEY GET TO MAKE THE FUCKING DECISION INSTEAD OF MY FUCKING DEPT. MANAGER? My dept. manager literally told me if it was up to her she would've had me work 16 hours and just called another person in to work 20 hours since work was picking back up. There's no reason why us two should be the only ones in the ENTIRE fucking building being full-time busting our asses while the rest of our dept. gets to stay home on furlough collecting the $600.

Sorry if this is super lengthy but my job has honestly just been a pain in the ass about this whole thing and obviously they don't give a shit about their employees. It just infuriates me and honestly I was gonna quit around April and find another job before fucking COVID-19.

I just don't know how long I can do this anymore because this is fucking with me mentally and I honestly don't know what to do cause there's no jobs out there.

Three weeks in, I was notified by the boss that I don't have any shifts for the week due to the online shop's low sales and it was not enough to pay every employee, so I relaxed for the week. At the end of the week, I did not receive any texts from him to come to work and decided to finally message him, only to get laid off for the same reason that their poor sales from their shop were not enough to pay employees. It took a fraction of a brain cell to determine that it was a lie because the last time I was working I saw them bring a man in to do a trial period, which I now know was to replace me. Another thing was that their business is thriving during this pandemic so another bullshit reason. He said that if there are any changes on his end, he will reach out to me. Months later, I decided to ask him but all I got was a literal ""no."" 

I have since moved on to this new cashier job but can't help but be appalled because it was such an obvious lie and he probably assumed I was stupid too. If I am not good enough for the job, might as well tell me that, rather than try and ghost me then lie assuming I won't catch on.",False,namj1j,batoura,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/namj1j/the_time_i_got_laid_off_and_they_tried_to_come_up/,5,1

2574,$8hr boss discouraging finding new jobs,She said people are stupid if they leave the $8 an hour job and go to work somewhere for 15 or more. Currently she is understaffed and currently I have job interviews lined up with some waiver places that will give me about two more dollars on the hour since I'm already making around$15. My boss makes $6 an hour because she works around 100 hours a week 7 days a week. And she's going to be mad as hell did all these entry level people will have a way better paying job than she does after she's been working for 40 years. Is this normal to be such an ass? Is it normal for someone to discourage people from bettering themselves she's already told me that I'll never get another raise and it's been 2 years for me because no one working in this sector of work deserves any more than eight dollars an hour and the old owner gave me what I make now. She will take a good worker that's been here for a year who's been promised or raise after so many days and then she tells them the owner won't give it to him when it's really hurting that she refuses to ask because she still stuck in the mindset of 2008 or people are lucky to have an $8 an hour job she don't realize that it's no longer like that.

My job is starting to leave me feeling unmotivated and I don’t want to do it or anything anymore. At the same time I feel bad because of my salary and benefits I’m sure anyone would want this job. But it’s just too stressful for me. I get anxiety when it comes to my managers and coworkers I hate asking them for help. I feel like too I’m just no longer passionate about this job so everyday when I wake up I’m dreading the day and just want it to be over. I’m tired of all the paperwork and this demanding job. It’s just too stressful I honestly wish I could handle it but I just can’t anymore. I have tried to apply elsewhere but no luck. I’m burnt and dead inside. I have started the process of starting my own little business but it’s not even fully there yet like I’m at the beginning stages of it all.

2580,People shaming others for not working enough and not having kids,"Okay.

My fiancees brother in law works roughly 65-70 hours per week running two businesses. Recently, he came to visit. He gets zero time to do anything for himself or to enjoy life. Regularly says phrases such as, ""What I want doesn't matter anymore tehehehe"". As if it is funny. 

I find it depressing and unfortunate, but I digress.

My fiancee happened to mention that I work about 20-25 hours per week. He was flabbergasted. He just kept asking questions, ""well, what do you do with the other time?"".... After trying to explain that I relax, read, play games, and study up on more automation techniques to speed up me doing my work for about 15 minutes... I could clearly see he was not ""getting it"". He then made some ""jokes"" poking fun at that fact that, ""it won't last forever"" or ""once the kid comes"", etc. You know, the coping techniques people are that mentally and physically exhausted do.

I understand that some people are so conditioned to slaving every waking minute working and the other 30 seconds on their children, but that does not mean others want the same.

I enjoy my time of relaxation. Being able to slowly cook a meal while drinking and coffee and listening to a book in peace. I do not want to give that up and it is my choice. My choice alone.

So if you can convince yourself you're happy working 70 hours per week, restricted on what you can eat because of your wife, or have never had more than 10 minutes to relax, good for you. I however, still belief life has a purpose; **time to enjoy oneself or another. Also, never shame someone for working smarter, not harder.** Just because a lot of people don't have the drive or intelligence to learn how to automate portions of their jobs, it does not make them better. It is quite the opposite. I worked hard for what time I gave myself to relax, don't try to make it feel like a negative thing.

Its chaotic and I no longer can even perform my normal job duties, because every moment at work I have to be focusing on the additional work dropped on us (yet if we lapse on our normal duties we get criticized for that as well).

They also like to tell us that we still have the bandwidth to do more work, and that we need to get with the program because even more is going to be dropped on us in the coming weeks.

Why would I work for money if I’m destroying something else along the way, and ultimately, showing up to work for a company, cause, boss, that I DO NOT give a SHIT about. (Not to mention I have to personally inquire about it, and be GENUINELY happy. I cannot FAKE happiness, because I am not an ACTOR).

You see, I eat and paint.  So why would I work for any company that doesn’t prepare food, stock paint, or is a utility, like electricity or plumbing? I wouldn’t. Those people are wholly useless to me. The fact that the “jobs” that are of no importance to me pay their people (that they control by financial scare ALONE) enough to survive, yet a non-worker isnt given fundamental stipends to survive makes my blood boil. 

These people are part of NO problem, they just dont REPORT to anyone else. News flash: living life as a non-worker in American society is just as stressful, if not MORE stressful than having a secure income every week. You think we dont work on ourselves? On our families, our goals, our bodies? Get a fucking grip. 

I think it is morally responsible to not support something and its means of labor and production only because it is providing you money. The behavior is disgusting and reprehensible to me. In my view, if people are adding to the culture and not dismantling their community, allow them to be given necessary food to survive.

I hope this is taken the right way. I really do believe in a lot of what I read here, but sometimes it seems we see ourselves at the bottom of the pyramid when in reality we’re somewhere in the middle.

Maybe the minimum wage should raised. I’m not an economist. I have no idea what it’ll really do. I would love to see workers treated better and not be looked at as cogs in the machine. If we could all live at the grace of AI and not work ever again... we’d all still hate our lives. 

There was a quote I can’t remember that went something like “Once we achieve utopia, the first thing we’d do is destroy it just so something interesting would happen.”

Here’s my theory. 

I think meaning in life is to be mainly derived from responsibility: family, a career, helping society, ect. If we eventually end up with zero responsibilities and we can all just busy ourselves with instant gratification and reproduction, we’d hate ourselves. You might not be happy, but if you have a job that helps at least a few people a day that supports your family, then you can at least know that it means something.

How is this ethical in a system that requires money to survive?","I understand that the intention in these kinds of US ""Right to Work"" laws is to give away the power of those requiring employment to the employer. However, we are also seeing the downside of employers having that power since they can then legally pay less than is required to live, dismal work conditions, and overwork, where there are rampant strikes and refusal to work. For any work that can be automated or done overseas for cheaper, the jobs disappear. That seems like poor planning on the part of the 1% since people can't buy products &amp; services  without income, and if too many people are not working the system shuts down. People get upset and unrest begins. This cycle has already repeated multiple times in history and is happening now yet I've seen no meaningful changes proposed besides taking away unemployment to force people to work. But if working doesn't actually allow people to pay for basic needs, then on some level it makes more sense to just band together with other exploited people and refuse to work. Am I missing something? Why not have laws against firing employees for no reason like some other capitalist countries? That at least puts off potential unrest and creates a (often false but effective) feeling of stability in the long run. Am I missing something?

2661,You are worth more than you know.,"A week or so ago, I started sending messages to people who wanted a real chance to try Work From Home jobs that were for real and not MLMs or scams or commission work.  

In total, I think I sent out a few hundred messages to grateful people who put in the slightest bit of effort to get those links.

Since then, several dozen people have replied back saying that they're in the process of being hired on.  

With that as solid motivation, as well as the constant talk that I see of people having to apply for jobs paying less than $10 an hour, I've decided to post these links HERE and NOW for everyone to see and use.  

These jobs are legit.  They pay $13-$19 an hour.  The links I put in are NOT to 4-5 companies, but to 5 different job aggregate sites that are paid to find WFH employees for dozens of companies.

I've worked for 4 of 5 of these companies, but not for Agero, which was recommended to me, instead.  But, I've had personal work experience with the others and can confirm 100% that they're above board.

They pay for training, they offer set schedules with FT hours for $13 and up.  These jobs require a semi-decent computer(requirements vary from company to company) and possibly a hard-line landline phone.  Again, it varies.

The only thing I ask of this is that you contact me via message if you get hired on.  

No, I won't be providing any 'referral' ID #s that some companies use to reward employees for referring people who stick around for six months or whatever.  This ain't one of those things.

Just let me know if you get hired on, and if you know anyone who needs the links, just pass them along to them.  

We have to help each other.

Ok so I’ve been working for this grocery store since I was 16. At first I really loved it because I was able to get things off my mind and have met a lot of people. Coming my senior year of highschool I would work almost 40 hours a week on top of taking 8 classes, and found it as a way to not think about family issues I was having and it honestly just made me feel good about myself because the managers always said how good of a company it was and promoted me to the front desk, which is a glorified position but really just more work to get paid the same.  I was basically made to believe this company was the only way to go, and would even put it before school work my freshman year of college because they told me I could get into management which I found out later was BS. I’m moving into my junior year of college now and I’ve been absolutely miserable with this job for about two years now. The culture and is just absolutely toxic and the things I always hear makes me so angry because of how unfair they can be to associates. I’ve gone through phases where I would apply for other jobs and even got offers to make 18 an hour but I would then deny them because I’m scared to leave and almost feel emotionally attached with the job I’m at now. I don’t have a back up job but I have the option of going instacart and shipt, and was thinking of doing that until I find a new job. I just know if I don’t quit now, I never will until I graduate in grad school.

2693,Cliché Rant,"I recently got back from my first vacation of the year: a four day trip to Colorado with my mom for Mother's Day. It was nice, I got to spend time with my mom and get out of town and I even took an extra day off to recuperate after getting back as vacations can be exhausting in themselves. The extra day off was just spent sleeping and I felt that I wasted it considering the rest of the week was going to be spent catching up on the paperwork and correspondence that was inevitably going to pile up since I'm the only one that knows the ins and outs of my position. Using a measly two days of PTO and the weekend for my vacation has already created overtime for myself and it feels like I'm being punished.

I almost tasted freedom in the trip, but the knowledge of the busy upcoming week was always in the back of my mind. What am I even doing this for? I did not get a higher education after high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do and I'm thankful my younger self didn't incur any debt, I honestly couldn't imagine that pressure. I've worked in my field for around 10 years now and make around 46k annually which I thought was decent considering the no debt situation. I've been frugal and responsible with my money my entire adult life (I'll be 30 this year), but I can't even afford a fucking house in the town I live. With closing costs and a down payment I could comfortably afford a house in the $120-$125,000 range, but guess what? Any houses that price in my town are absolute shitholes or are literally over 100 years old with crumbling foundations. I looked at a foreclosure for $120,000 and the repairs put me way over budget. It's so fucking depressing. I lived my 20s hopping from relationship to relationship, got married then divorced two months later after she cheated on me; I've decided to not try to focus on relationships to find happiness but that also means I probably will never be able to afford a house where I live considering I'd need another's income to help me pay for anything livable. 

So now that working to support a family is out of the picture, what's the point? Like many others in this sub I am so mentally and physically drained at the end of the day that I have no ambition or energy for my hobbies; the weekends are spent catching up on chores and all the books, games, movies, shows, crafts and outdoor activities I like to partake in are brushed aside so that I'm not living in squalor. I'm thankful I have a support group of friends and family to keep me sane, without them I would've committed suicide long ago, but they all seem to be in the same boat I'm in. We regularly gather for board-game nights or dinner but you can see the exhaustion in all of them. Who does this system satisfy? In my area the gap between the poor and blue collar is almost non-existent, one bad week and some of my friends might be financially in shambles. 

I've always fantasized about living in a camper, I've done research and calculated the cost of a yearly lot rental in a town I'd like to live in but I'm afraid to take that leap. My dad is getting older and cuts trees as a side-gig and helping him through the years I would be fairly comfortable taking over that business, I just don't know if there would be enough work throughout the year to support me. If there was a tree or two a week I think I could live comfortably and have the majority of the week to myself to fuck off and pursue my interests, but the fear of not having insurance, getting hurt and being unable to work really does scare me. At the same time, right now I really don't feel like I'm living my one life to anywhere near the extent I could be. Another issue with that plan is being judged for living in a camper in a grungy trailer court; I'd like to say it wouldn't bother me, but it'd be hard to take a friend or date home and expect them not to be sketched out. I also prided myself on carving my own legacy and would be slightly disappointed in myself for having to pick up the business that my dad built, although I think I'd get over that one eventually. Today I've felt hopeless trying to weigh the two options I can think of. I'm not a risk taker but I think something has to change here. Thank you for reading.

After I was hired, I explained to the manager that I needed a flexible schedule due to my online college courses which are usually comprised of zoom meetings and assignments that can only be started and completed on certain days and certain times. The manager said she was more than happy to provide accommodation and drew up a personalized schedule for me.

Today, on what was supposed to be my first day, she called me in for work within a time period outside the personalized schedule that I cannot work in. I told her as such and she simply told me *''you don't have the option to choose when you work, you work when I need you''* And she described the schedule she drew up for me as a ''miscommunication''. Eventually, she told me, she would see if anyone else could cover for me and get back to me.

2701,my first experience as a meat processing worker,"Hey guys, I started a job at meat processing about 2 days ago, and I'm thinking that the place isn't for me, this is my first time ever working on a meat processing plant. I have couple of concerns and problems within the job; (keep in mind that I'm a full time casual for this job.) 

&amp;#x200B;

1. The hours are so long, we work for 11 hrs (5am-4pm) but fridays are from 5am-12pm + overtime. (I havent experienced working on a friday but from what i hear overtime is highly possible) 
2. The first break goes on for about 15 minutes, but the problem is, we don't stop until we finished up the batch of animals that was already skinned, and on the hooks so we stay there even if the break already started. So we start the break late but the problem is that I don't even have 5 mins to sit down and take a breather, we only ever eat for 3mins and drink and get back to our post. It is the same even with the longest break we have which is supposed to be 30mins but we only get 10mins till we have to get to work. I just feel so overworked and not having complete breaks definitely breaks my spirit. 
3. There were no prior explanation/instructions on what I should be doing, sometimes I feel lost. 
4. They want us to be at work on time, but the breaks are never on time. 
5. When I got my vaccine for the work, i got asked straightaway to start, but I argued that we arent supposed to lift anything heavy and there could be side effects, said the doctor. I found out later that we were supposed to wait 15days prior from vaccination to enter any high risk area, when I mentioned this to the agency they just ignored my messages, I wanted to confirm this with them as I dont think they got me covered when I do get sick. 

I feel like this job tires me both physically and mentally. I do appreciate that I have work, but it just feels like we're not being treated right and it feels like I'm being a slave throughout the day.

I’ve always thought the eight hour workday was outdated but who want to see works eight hours a day? I find myself sleeping in, slacking, doing the dishwasher/small chores during the day. 

I’d like to go back to the office at least in a limited capacity but my job hasn’t allowed it yet. I’m doing my job and getting good feedback from my coworkers/boss, I’ve been very unmotivated during Covid.

I’ve just been really burnt out and my mental health has been struggling hence all tbe extra sleep. I know I can’t be the only one.

2709,Costco interveiw,"I went for a job interview fir a deli position at a costco today. The interviewer asked me if I would be willing to work a shift from 6am to 12midnight. I thoight that was a bit silly, so I asked him to clarify and he ment would I be willing to work the more than 12 hour shit of 6am to midnight straight. So I tell him that I would do it in an emergency situation, but no. And he then asked me if I would take a full week of that schedule. To which I say no. I would not. He then tells me that despite this being a part time position with no intent to ever give me those kind of hours that I am not suited for the job because I am not willing to ""do whatever it takes"" so like wtf I didn't get the job because I didn't lie about the hours, because no one is going to work those hours for 15 an hour. Why even ask me about something that extreme if its for a part time position. Anyway I contacted corprate.

2722,New Car Sales and Unfair Wages,"I work for a company handling order status requests from customers for a large vehicle manufacturer. 

It amazes me how many people drop tens of thousands of dollars on a brand new vehicle, only to then get upset at me, the lowly employee making barely over $15/hr, because the microchip shortage is affecting their order's build schedule so they wont be getting their fancy gas-guzzling SUV in the next week.

The best part is the company wants us to grant these upset customers service packages that cost upwards of a couple thousand dollars for their dissatisfaction due to the delays in production. This is the same company that gave me a 15 cent raise for my recent yearly performance review.

I have no problem providing a service, but i only ask that i be compensated well enough seeing as these vehicles cost 30k+ and our case drivers are mostly the ""premium"" +$60k models.

How can these companies say they want to provide premium customer service for their premium vehicle owners while providing shit pay to their ""premium"" employees? This shit doesn't sit right with me and I really wish the employees started striking for better wages.

2723,I Cant Wait to Leave This Job,"Ive been with this company for a number of years, and seemingly had a great time moving my way up the corporate ladder. Then once the pandemic hit and we were all WFH, the company seemed to stop caring about the effort I put into trying to attain a better promotion to trainer or supervisor. The amount of effort you put into a company does not matter to most of these owners, nor their leadership (henchmen supervisors).

I was ignored when I went through the interview process for team lead as the feedback I received was that I did not provide enough substance over other interviewees. What makes me feel even worse is that the couple of people that were promoted over me were not even doing the job they were supposed to as they got pulled aside to handle other projects.

My previous leadership tried telling me that they also take into consideration how interviewees take a decline of promotion and said the company likes those who take the feedback and improve for next time. This guy was truly a piece of work too - he would talk shit to me about other employees during our ""coaching"" sessions.

Its taken me too long to realize that I was just lucky for some time, and now i can only make more at this company IF they say i can be promoted, because get this - they say im nearing my wage CAP! LOL

2728,Why work is toxic,"I started searching for job 1 year after completing bachelor's in computer science.
I attended the Amazon SDE Interview and I had 8 rounds of interview.After that I was told I was not up to the mark with SDE as I was lacking Amazon leadership principles and they gave me support engineer role.
And they promised me that they would convert me to SDE in a year.
When I joined for work,my manager didnt allow me to attend bootcamp and gave me data analysis and anamoly detection work in the system and I had to design SQL queries and data presentations  for customers to tally every month Amazon bank balance.Thus report generation takes like 120 queries to be run and the consolidated one from the results is the report.It takes days to trace back where the problem is when we can't tally.

I have been given these repetitive tasks that takes a lot of time.Each query runs for like 30 min.And they rejected my request for more resource for fast computation.
During this pandemic I was in wfh and works like 15 hours a day average.And in the start of the month I had to work sleepless to achieve the goal that they set.

My team member lied that he had done the system migration from Europe to India and he was taking alot of leaves.
I found that he been telling lies. I could see the reports are generated from data and services located in Europe.
I asked him about this and he lied to me too and started avoiding me.
I told my manager that it will be a big issue.instead of telling the truth to customer team,my manager asks me to lie.his exact words ""how will the clients know if you don't tell"".
It's been bothering me a lot as I was forced to lie.i was feeling a lot of pressure when I had to talk to customer Amazon team manager.i told my manager that I am not comfortable at all.i was taking leaves to avoid talking to the customer team too.i even told this to my manager.after a month my manager calls me and says that Amazon employees should comport the problem and talks leadership principle BS.I was blamed for things that they failed to do.

My manager lied to them after a month that the system in India is having issue and they have to fix it and starts the migration.

After 9 months suddenly I was assigned a coding work to make 2 CLI.I have no experience on Amazon systems and I was given 1 week to complete it.And the reason my manager gave me was to shift me to SDE.
I had no experience in Java ,I don't know the work environments and there were no documentations for my team.i had to nag the sde's for everything.
Meanwhile my manager goes to holiday.this cli work is supposed to be completed in a week.and the customer Amazon team's manager is yelling that I am not available to solve their issue tickets and complaining to my manager who is in holiday.
My manager calls me and shouts at me that I should take ownership and tells the same old Amazon leadership principle BS.

I was able to complete the CLI within the time.
And after that my manager started shoutong at me for things that I have no control over in team meetings just to put me in blame.
My maanger told his manager that they completed a goal months back which we didn't actually start just to get high ratings and already published a success story.
And me and 2 sde in my team had to work weekends and all nighters to complete it  just to make our manager escape from his lies.
My manager and the customer Amazon manager both got promotion for their lies.
We came to know it from other team.

Suddenly my manager started adding negative feedback to my career development page that I am not improving and he has been guiding me for long time ,which is complete BS. He started talking to me a month back and had a session of 10 min per week They didn't even let me learn their systems first and expected me to work right away and gives deadlines needed for a  experienced sde.

And my manager says that I am not working enough.
And states that all Amazonian work overtime to complete their goals.
I haven't seen my manager work before 11 am and after 6 am in office.
He  won't even talk with customer team to schedule our teams work.
Also he rejects all my internet bill reimbursement with silly reasons and I stopped applying for them .
Everyone is getting desk,chairs ,extra montiors and power backup in my team.
He started shouting in team meetings for everything.

I was overworked.
I woke up one day and was feeling very sick and went to hospital and came back .
My manager calls me and asks why didn't i join the meeting and started yelling.
I told him that I was sick and I'll be taking the day off.
He told me that he don't care about my health and yells ""the only thing needed is the work to be completed in time"".i started crying.i don't know what to do.its was my first job.
I was working that day sick.
After that day I called him and said that I quit.
He said ok and hang up and not even asked the reason.
Feels like this was his goal after all.
He didn't even told the team that I'll be leaving in a month.
There's no documentation of the work I do.iasked him whether I should create a doc.
He asked me to do the usual work.
And in the last day,he told my team that I'll be leaving  and I didn't even attend the farewell video call.

2732,I need an advice,"TLDR : should I find another job or I my decision is too impulsive ?

While I was attending a high school I managed to finish studying at IT school with gold medal - 2.5 years of study (basically it contains of 2-3 month courses for each IT departments and also brief course of videography and 3dsMax). After school I obtained a Bachelor degree as a seaman, so I have an opportunity to work as a captain of merchant ship if I work for about 15 years as Junior and senior officer (3rd, 2nd and chief officer). But this job didn't met my expectations - even if the salary is much better than ashore, there is to much risks for both mental and physical health. 

And I found a job at apartment renovation company as photographer (my hobby become a job). After 8 months of work in this company there is to much shit happening here. I cannot improve my skills here, afford new equipment, I am being underpaid ($500 which is average, not median, salary for my country if you include poor rural area to the statistics).  Starting from January I am working in this company as photographer and system administrator (it department) and my salary is $700 for now. But still I have feeling that I am wasting time here. SMM manager and CMO have no idea what they want from me. I've been stressed out as they try to make me guilty for the things I have no control of - access to apartments (I have no keys, and workers will be there at 1pm, not 9am as planned), workers not willing to put on uniform to make photos, I cannot make photos from tripod due to garbage or 30kg bags of materials in middle of rooms, etc.

About my skills - I am fluent in English, know Latin and German a bit (A1 level). English knowledge is great benefit in my country, almost everybody is below A1. I am great in IT, even know basics of C++ and Java. Great googling skills and knowledge of physics helps me a lot.

I hated it so much that I honestly hoped I would get hit by a car when I was walking over. I had to fight for a shitty graveyard shift that no one else even wanted, just so I could have two consecutive days off in a row sometimes. The days off were never consistent so I could never make plans unless I requested time off, and that was a whole ordeal on its own. And asking for a single weekend off? Good fucking luck. I’d get harassed constantly to come in on my days off, or to come in early. The customers were the worst pieces of shits I ever had the misfortune of dealing with.

It wasn’t until a couple months ago when the city announced that they were mass hiring for a certain position that I applied for something else, and I was so happy and relieved when I had gotten the spot it was like I was alive again.

What's more, the boredom set in between spikes in stressing out as the very position I was in caused friction with the rest of the department (we were responsible for sorting tasks and sending them to people because, despite their importance, no one had figured out how to dole them out any other way). I also struggled to find things to keep myself looking busy and was constantly talked to about not getting enough numbers.

So I, for a month, knuckled down and did my best. I applied for a higher position and, after some time, got it. I had to go back through training but I like learning and I've never minded this so I leapt at the opportunity. I get ""On the floor"" as they say soon after getting out of training and I'm producing great numbers. It's stressful, I make constant mistakes, but I keep it up. The first year didn't go amazing, was threatened with physical violence a couple of times, and if you've ever done insurance adjusting, you know that people will lie and misrepresent on a daily basis. But I got home at 6:30 every day and I thought I could handle it until I had enough experience to find another job.

My final year in insurance, COVID hit. Everyone was sent home. We thought it's temporary so no one really planned anything out. I was still expected to follow strict rules about timing, but to make sure that we do, they start dropping extra tasks and start watching time not answering calls very carefully. By the end of the year, I was taking days off because of the stress and dealing with stress-induced stomach problems. I had picked up drinking more than I ever had in the past and worse, I thought I was weak because ""you're working from home, this is so easy!"" I managed to get on the wrong side of a vengeful agent. I made it through by the skin of my teeth and by grinding away and going beyond, but I'm constantly tripped up as more work is directed my way.  Things started to even out as we go into winter, which was when everything slows down for this department I was a part of.  (Spring/Early Summer was when the department was most busy with the lowest amount coming in in the winter.)

And then, during the slow season, during a period when we have the least amount of calls and the lowest amount of mail to respond to, they called for overtime. The excuse was that we've slipped behind that quarter but I started looking at it and I couldn't figure it out; we were ahead of every queue. I thought it would last a week, but I worked overtime on Christmas eve and New Years eve. The whole rest of the month too. Something was screaming in my head because we'd never pulled overtime. Never. 

Then this year, the Texas Ice Storm hit. My department didn't even handle those claims, but we were expected to answer the calls and pull 60 hour weeks--this lasted three weeks--with half our staff moved over specifically to dealing with that. I wasn't even given any training for this and people would transfer calls to me. I broke down in front of a customer because their house was still flooding and I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to tell them except mitigate and someone would be out eventually. The whole reason I had stayed with this job, the idea I was helping people, and for ten hours a day, every other call I was the worthless sack of shit they threw at the problem pants down. For 6 days a week. 

I only made it through that because of my friends. I am eternally grateful for every call I made to them to get through that. 

Things went back to normal, but I wasn't able to ignore the problems with the job anymore. Everyday was confrontation. Everyday was lies. Everyday was being the bad guy in someone's story. Being a limp-wristed, burnt out Goliath in some David's tale. And then, at the quarter's end, they started enforcing overtime, threatening if we didn't pick up the pace, they'd ratchet back up to 60 hour weeks.

I've been unemployed almost a month now. Didn't have anything else to go to. I'm still feeling the toxicity of that job but everyday I'm feeling a little better. I know I have to go back and work again at some point but man, I really pray I never have to adjust another claim. 

Thanks for getting through all this if you did.",False,n9dvi0,TheyCallMePistachio,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9dvi0/i_left_a_toxic_mess_of_a_job/,3,1

My question is this; would you not agree that working in fast food or other low paying jobs is completely related to level of skill required to do the job? That fast-food employment is not designed to be a career? But merely a stepping stone to develop further skills and education to acquire high paying high skill jobs?

2773,Actual help needed,"Hey everyone- I’ve lurked on this sub for a long time but I genuinely hope you can help me. Sorry it’s so long but it’s 2 am and I’m desperate and exhausted. I’ve long given up on finding a job I love, find satisfying, that I’m well compensated for, with a good work/life balance/schedule. Now I just want one I can tolerate. One that I don’t wake up every work day immediately thinking “fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. I don’t want to go.” I’ve tried several jobs in several fields and I’ve loathed them all. I thought I wanted a white collar job in finance. I got it. I hate it. It checks so many of the boxes I thought would help- very low customer interaction, no answering the phone, Monday-Friday with no exact start/end time, a genuinely fantastic kind boss (didn’t know that was possible), I’m not standing on concrete all day, and it’s work I’m good at. Turns out I hate sitting all day. I can’t stand just sitting at a computer all day. Every day I spend more and more time on my phone just trying to squeeze a smidgen of dopamine into my brain. Then I feel guilty about running the clock because my time gets billed to clients and I try to work and then I’m back on my phone within minutes. I’ve looked for more blue collar jobs because I actually did enjoy cleaning houses for a short while and liked the instant satisfaction of seeing the immediate progress. But as I’m a petite woman, a lot of blue collar jobs are either physically impossible or just not a safe environment. I worked at Lowe’s for 3 years and the employees and customers were often unbearable and inappropriate. I finally quit after telling a manager about another  customer grabbing my ass and him shrugging and asking me what I expected. I find something intolerable at every profession I consider. I don’t want too many customers-pretending to be happy and polite is draining and soul sucking. I don’t want to sit all day. I don’t want to be wet all the fucking time. I hate being wet for prolonged periods. I don’t want to deal with feces. I don’t want to clean bathrooms. I’m afraid of heights. And spiders. I can’t think of a single job that I want. I’ve worked so many different shitty jobs. And I still have 30+ more years to work, if I’m lucky and can actually retire. What the fuck am I supposed to do for employment that won’t make me hate my life? As an American the work pays pathetically so it’s work too many hours and still be poor. Going through zip recruiter and I see jobs that should be 4 separate jobs that pays scraps. “Must wear multiple hats and multitask” i.e- we are going to work you to death and it still won’t be enough all for $16.50- in expensive Colorado. I’ve sucked it up and worked hard at various jobs for 15 years. I have nothing to show for it but loathing and resentment. I’m not lazy- I don’t mind hard work, I actually enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done. I consider any physical effort to be a workout and lean into it. But I need help finding a job that doesn’t make me want to stab an eye out just so I don’t have to go in.",False,n9rkp9,JoyouslyMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9rkp9/actual_help_needed/,4,1

2791,"If I can't escape wage slavery, sooner or later I'm ending my life","I have always been disenchanted with the world. Having been born without my consent, into a frictional state of constant desire, need, and exposed to pain both mental and physical. Forced into a system of obligations, chance, and competition. School only stunted my learning. College feels useless, not only a waste of time but also a grim reminder that you learn for others' sake... so that you can become a better profit-making machine. Wage-slavery lurks on the horizon, ready to finally crush all my hopes of a life worth living. For how good is life if one's not at the helm?

I've tried, but wage-slavery seems inevitable. There's no way to escape it. There's no way not to be constrained into the capitalist mode of production. Myself being just a byproduct of capitalism, with consumerism and interaction with commodities being my main activities. I cannot farm, hunt, or produce by myself what I need to live. I have no property, no capital, no knowledge, and no motivation. I'm subjected to the ups and downs of an irrational machine and psychopathic people. If I want to force myself into living a hunter-gatherer life as Ted Kaczinski did, I will most probably die within a month and regret it all, being alone, and finding no real pristine place left. I'm also a coward.

My existential angst goes beyond normal sadness. It's a state of discontent, of ""this is ridiculous"" at almost everything. Nothing makes even a little sense anymore. We grow for growth's sake. We produce dozens of times what we did in the past, yet housing is a luxury, food, clothing and basic services are not universal. Not even mentioning healthcare or education, which are also restricted through money, citizenship, or educational requirements. We don't take care of our planet or of each other. We're heading for disaster, in a hedonistic spiral of consumerism, bread, and circuses. I'm of course guilty of that too. Consciousness needs to be filled with distractions.

I hate that all of this is dismissed as a pathology, as ""chemical imbalance"", when it's not only rational to expect slaves to hate their situation but also unclear whether there's even a ""chemical balance"" to speak of. Hotline numbers, countless arguments, bans, censorship, yet they cannot prevent suicide by merely making it taboo. The restrained soul will inevitably seek to escape this prison. Do you know what would really be ""suicide prevention""? Giving us a reason to keep on living, the chance to exert our autonomy, to develop as people, to pursue our dreams instead of working for those of others. Nobody wants to accept this, though. Even most slaves don't want to see their chains and look everywhere but at their chained feet.

Yesterday we were told that we are going to be forced back to the office next month whether we like it or not. We’ve also been told that our usual pay rise and bonus is cancelled - despite the fact our bosses are still collecting theirs. This is all in spite of the fact that we worked out absolutes asses off during the pandemic. 

Today was the final straw. Most of our customers are assholes but today I experienced the worst abuse I have ever dealt with as a call handler. It pushed me over the edge, the dark thoughts started to creep in. I decided at that moment that my mental health MUST come first. I logged out, told my manager and then made a call to my doctor to get signed off long term. I will find a new job in due course.

2830,How to preserve my identity outside of work?,"So I just recently started a new job after a long period of being unemployed by choice. It's a fairly comfortable, low-stress office job. 30 hours a week, 6 hours a day, a full hour for lunch. The pay is fairly generous and I get benefits and a pension.

The problem is, I can't shake that feeling of ""oh god, this is what the rest of my life will be like.""

I hate feeling like my entire life will be all about work and the dread of becoming another anonymous slave to the faceless capitalistic machine that drives society. I dislike the notion of willingly ceding control over my life. I really also resent the loss of my free time to pursue my own creative hobbies and interests. Since getting this job, I've been extremely preoccupied with the role of ""work"" in society and the more I think about it, the more bitter I feel myself getting. I don't like feeling this way.

Maybe I'm overreacting, but if anyone has any advice for me on how I could maybe stop overthinking myself into a negative spiral about this, I would hugely appreciate it.",False,n9nnok,Shaboba330,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9nnok/how_to_preserve_my_identity_outside_of_work/,10,1

2837,I made a mistake and told someone at the office something I shouldn't have (details inside). Pretty sure they're going to try and fire me over this. Having a bit of anxiety over this.,"**I work for a very very very big company you all know of**. **The pay is high**. The role itself is the exact definition of [a bullshit job](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/) \- one that serves no purpose, helps nobody, manufactures paperwork and should not exist.

\~5 years before I started working here, I had an account on a training website, with an email address of username@previous-ecompany.com. I initially paid them for it with my own money - it was just $15-20 per training course. 

At some point, all staff with any-user@previous-ecompany.com email addresses were given free unlimited lifetime access to the training material. The training website granted us that access if we had a company email address. 

Thing is, I discovered that despite the fact that my username@previous-ecompany.com is long defunct, the login to that training website still works. You can change the registration email to a personal gmail.com address, and they don't revoke your benefits. 

So naturally, I used it and accessed one free study course briefly. A freebie is a freebie. 

I didn't think it was different that wearing a t-shirt you got for free from a previous employer, with the company logo.

\*\*\*

I told this person, who's in a team lead role, thinking it's no big deal. I thought this was less than jaywalking. 

But **he made it very clear he's going to report me to HR and manager**. I have a good reason to believe now that he has reported me before, for complaining about my pay publicly over company chat (I had just discovered that day that someone with equal skills and experience to mine was getting 5% more, and wasn't happy).

**Despite the fact that I've been wanting to leave this job for a long time, I have a bit of anxiety over this.** I know it's for the best. I have savings, I can survive 2-3 years without working. I could study, travel, rest, read etc. My meds are fairly expensive ($400 a month), and my health insurance corporate plan covers 90% of the cost. So if I'm fired, it'd suck, but I can absorb the cost.

I had to do some thinking on why I dread what's coming so much, and I realized that the investigation and numerous hearings and meetings with my manager/HR reps when they fire me for misconduct would be a lot of stress. I know how these people work. **They do this ritual where they pretend they let you defend yourself, but it's not a court.** They just do it for the record, but **they already decided to fire you.** I have zero agency in these hearings. I cannot change their minds, it'll be stressful and unpleasant still.

2848,"""It's a shame for grown men to sit at home.""","My (M24) orthodox indian mother never liked the idea of me having a chilled out life. They would compell me to go to an office where theres no place to take a dump so I would starve for hours just so that I dont have to shit. It was like a nightmare life. Just that they don't force me now. So many times my mother has said that we wanted to have male childs so that they start bringing $$$ to us. I feel so disgusted. That's okay for kids to pay for their parents if they become rich at a young age but just wanting male child for $$$ is pathetic.


Forget going out and working, indian conditions are so unhygienic a person sweats up profusely if he stands in the public roads for like 10 minutes. We aren't like the upper middle classes of folks here who have cars and clean offices. To reach 5kms in local trains means having a bath in your own sweat. Just in my neighbourhood theres a guy (M23) whose the only child and taken good care of. He works barely 5 hours a day at his dads business and chills every single day with friends. So it's not like all indians are orthodox people who want kids for$$$$. There are always the upper middle class and elite who dont suffer like us.

My parents wanted another male child after me cause  they assumed our wives would come and serve them in oldage while we brought the money. No wonder marriages are failing in india these days. India is one of the worst potential countries to work formal jobs. Your employer could exploit you with no consequences just cause we are 1.4 billion people.

2850,"The Pandemic is the best thing that could have happened to me. I haven't been this happy in years, if ever.","First and foremost, I'm not celebrating the death and misery Covid has caused for billions. I wish the worldwide near year-long hiatus (for many countries) was not due to a virus.

Nonetheless, I think the only way I could leave my miserable job, get the mental help needed, and regain control in my life was something as drastic as a worldwide freakin' pandemic. I worked in a job that left me in tears almost daily. I started drinking more to numb the pain. I stopped trusting people. AT ALL. My social anxiety was so bad, my voice would shake and croak when talking to people. I felt trapped. I'd fantasize of how I'd take my life; I Googled locations where I'd do it and how I'd do it.

Shortly before my work temporarily closed down in March, I told myself, next week. Next Week I'm submitting my 2 weeks notice. I calculated how long I could survive off of my savings (by a thread) before my partner graduated college and we could move in together. 

I had my letter typed out. It was literally just one working day before submitting my notice when work closed down. At one point my employers were accepting volunteers. It was voluntary, but Fuck that, I thought. So I didn't volunteer. However, at one point volunteering was explicitly stated as voluntary, but truly implicitly expected that we return as ""essential workers"". This was late May 2020 or so. However, I received a blessing disguise when HR sent me a lay off notice due to ""Covid"". But I know the real reason was due to me sending a demand letter for unpaid wages, after HR had ignored my multiple emails since January of that year. I was committed to filling that wage claim and kept a detailed log.

However, I was offered severance (though meager) and thus eligible for unemployment being laid off. The stress of depleting my savings was greatly mitigated, especially with bonus federal payments throughout the year. 

During that time, I finally got therapy, medication, and time to actually fucking *RELAX*. I had been working for 50 hours a week, for well over a year. I stopped enjoying life. I really forgot it all. My life was on autopilot. My depression was really difficult for my partner to handle, too. I have never been on unemployment in my life, but I had NEVER been this happy in my life. 

Now, my last job has fucked me, in ways therapy won't completely reverse. It's greatly limited other career paths I can choose to not make me miserable (e.g. I prefer solo work) and made me realize how much I simply do not want to work a 9-5. The Pandemic has given me the time and money needed to pursue something else so I have hope of leaving the rat race. And like many many others, especially on this sub, realize my worth and what's truly  important in this life.

TL;DR The Pandemic was the catalyst to being fired, but because of it, I was eligible for unemployment and got the help needed to treat my terrible depression. I've now had the time to pursue something I'm actually passionate about, which will greatly reduce my need to work and contribute to a content work/life balance.",False,n9q3l6,vegkittie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9q3l6/the_pandemic_is_the_best_thing_that_could_have/,9,1
2851,"I'm working up the courage to turn down a ""great opportunity""","I've reached the final stage of a long, stressful interview process and I'm waiting to hear back if I got the job. Their responses have been really positive and they told me I'm their number 1 contender, so it's seeming likely I'll get an offer. It's a full-time permanent position with health benefits at a big charity organization. When I first graduated university, it would have been my dream job.

But it's been nearly six years since I graduated, and in that time I've come to realize I am not built for the 9-5 grind. Working for charities has helped a bit in terms of motivation (*I'm helping to make the world a better place!*), but it's still mostly an identical situation in terms of toxic office culture, long hours, low pay, no freedom.

My whole life I've dreamed of becoming a published author. But I've always been told to pursue a ""real career."" I've been told that writing can be my ""fun hobby"", but it's very unlikely I'll ever make any real money from it. And it's true. Most writers have a ""day job"". So I got my day job and joined the grind.

It didn't go very well. Within three years my mental health plummeted. I became extremely depressed and started drinking and smoking weed every night to cope. And I stopped writing. I didn't write for nearly two years. It got so bad that I sought out an addictions counselor. I was nearing the end of a full-time temp office job, and extremely miserable. When the contract ended, my therapist encouraged me not to seek out another traditional full-time job right away. I told her how I'd stopped writing, and she encouraged me to take some writing classes. I got a part-time job at a coffee shop and started attending a creative writing certificate program. A year passed and I was able to get my substance use under control and start writing a new novel. I felt happy again for the first time in so long. 

Since then I've been working part-time contract jobs that make me enough money to get by, and give me the freedom to set my own schedule and pursue my actual dream, which is writing. Writing is the only work that has ever given me happiness. I know it is unlikely that it will ever make me any real money, but I'm okay with that. I would rather be happy and poor than rich and miserable. 

But the problem is --my fiance &amp; family don't see things this way. My fiance understands a little bit better than my family (mostly because he's experienced my addiction struggle firsthand), but he still thinks I should take this ""great opportunity"". He is a true-believer Capitalist workaholic who is very anxious about saving money for our future. He really believes that ""sucking it up"" and working the grind every single day is the best thing he can do for our future children. We've been together 11 years and I love him so much, and in every other way we are a great match and he's so supportive. But he's having so much trouble understanding why I don't want this ""great opportunity"". And my family is much the same. 

I feel so pressured to take the job, I keep hoping for a rejection email. Part of me thinks that if I get it, I should say yes. I should at least see how it goes. Give it a 3 month probation period - maybe it won't be as bad as I think. But the other part of me knows that if it wasn't for the pressure from my family / capitalist society, I wouldn't have even applied to this job in the first place. So maybe I should just turn it down, even if no one but me understands why. But hopefully you all understand.",False,n9esxr,balloongiraffe9300,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9esxr/im_working_up_the_courage_to_turn_down_a_great/,6,1

I got my call back and interview and everything, and I asked them if the drug screening was still a follicle test and they said yes. Well this is a problem, because my hair at the time was like 1/4 inch. And I don’t have body hair. So they MADE me sign a temporary contract with a local staffing agency until my hair is long enough. Even though I applied directly, and had previous experience (which they’ve definitely taken advantage of) since starting work there again my grandma died. Before coming back from bereavement leave, they called to give me an attendance warning. This was two weeks ago. Now I have food poisoning, been out for a day, and I’m considering not coming back. Because they told me they’d “allow” me to come back after I’m better if I came back with a doctor’s note (which I do have) as if I’m disposable enough for them to make that decision even though I’m one of like five people in the plant who are trained in my position.

2896,Things I'd wished I'd known when I was younger,"There was an /r/askredddit thread posted regarding life lessons you wish you'd learned 10 years ago. Reposting my comment here because I think it fits and I want to expand a bit on it.

&gt;You are not your job. You are more than just your job title. You don't have to have a certain salary to be worthwhile. ""Making it"" is having time to spend with friends, family, and pets and not stressing about if you have time to shower, eat, and get a few hours of sleep.

&gt;Working 80-100 hours/week doesn't mean you're successful, it means you're being taken advantage of. Mentally grinding yourself to the proverbial bone to get that report out isn't worth the anxiety and depression that comes with it.

&gt;Find value in yourself outside of work. Find a passion, a hobby, something that brings you actual joy that ISN'T work related. You will be much happier and thank yourself later.

A few years back I was actually taken out of work for mental health reasons. I'm a survivor of MST (Military Sexual Trauma) as well as combat PTSD. Basically it came down to I couldn't do my job AND get treatment for my issues. 

It was hard, letting go of working. I hadn't realized how much of my social interaction came from my job. Nor did I realize how much of my self-worth came from it either. My whole life, ""adults"" were defined by what they did, and what they did was who they were as a person. Not working, who was I? What am I? That was a huge struggle on top of dealing with everything else. I won't go into the financial side of things - that's a whole separate issue I'll comment on later.

My family, obviously, was raised the same as me. They were less concerned about why I was getting treatment (they knew about the combat PTSD but not the MST - most of them still don't know.) They worried about me just sitting at home playing video games (which, btw, are shown to help people with various forms of PTSD.) They worried about how I'd be able to get back into the workforce, my job skills stagnating. Even now I can tell they struggle to relate to me because I don't have a job, thus I don't have a label. They worry about me missing out on making money, that I could earn more working, that I'm self-sabotaging my life.

If you were to ask them if I have value as a person, even not working, they'd say ""Of course!"" but the reality is they can't conceive of a life without a job, a label, a title, a wage. I know this because I was there. I bragged about working 100 hour weeks. Juxtapose that with being the HR person who argued with management that the cost/benefit ratio for more hourly workers was better than paying people overtime (tired people are more likely to cut corners, make mistakes, get hurt thus raising our reject rate, QA issues, worker's comp/insurance premiums, etc.) It's so much harder to advocate for ourselves than it is to advocate for others. For us, its a sacrifice - we're willing martyrs to the almighty dollar. And when we 'get there' we tell ourselves ""I suffered through it, so it couldn't be THAT bad!"" so the cycle continues.

Money is key here. No matter how much I made, it always felt that I was going into more and more debt. Get a promotion? Need better clothes to fit in. Can't wear WalMart in the C-Suite after all. I can either afford rent in the area I work but not food, or rent and food with an hour plus commute. Of course, that commute takes gas, puts wear and tear on my vehicle, but most importantly takes time. That hour commute (one way) becomes 2 hours a day, or 10 hours for a 5 day work week. So if you're pulling 40 hours, you're really pulling 50. More often than not, you're likely working at least 60 hours a week so that's 70 hours of time allocated to work. There are 120 hours in a 5 day work week. After pulling a 14 hour day you have 10 hours to cook/eat, sleep, take care of personal hygiene, spend time with family, personal health (exercise/self care) before you rinse/repeat the next work day. That's simply not enough time so you either eat into one of your 2 days off or drop things the list (exercise/self care being the most common). 

For me, thankfully, the VA acknowledged the shit show they put me through and granted my disability. I used to feel guilty about being on disability but as my therapist said ""I frontloaded my contribution to society"" with my service and what I went through.     Do I plan on going back to work after completing my treatment? Nope. I plan on going back to school to better myself, follow my passions and then volunteer my services to others. I've budgeted my finances to be able to afford a comfortable life on my current pension. There are people who need the type of jobs that I'm qualified for because they don't have that safety net. I still struggle with seeing my own value and I'm still looking for that passion or hobby. Over 40 years of brain washing is hard to overcome, after all. I don't know if my experience resonates with anyone but I needed to say this and share my struggle.

2898,Free healthcare is not so great how you imagine it,"I see lots of people from US wanting to have free healthcare. But I'm not sure, if they are realizing those consequences.

I live in Czech Republic. We have healthcare, that we call free. Every month I see, that government takes my money on healthcare. And yeah, it's good that they won't throw me out, if I don't have insurance. 

BUT you have no option to not pay it, or pay more for better services. Thanks to this is our healthcare in really bad shape. It's not like we don't have good universities, but good medical workers always run away abroad, where they won't make 16 hour shifts for the same as me on customer support.

So free healthcare, but actually nobody cares. Yes, if I'd have cancer, I would be maybe in best hands (we have really great oncologists). But if my father has Leiden mutation, he will get help, but not so much. 

He had twice lung embolism. First time nobody knew, that he has Leiden. It was few minutes before he'd be dead. So they started to medicate him. After a month he was back, on diet and so on and so on. And he's got medicine, that he should take til the end of his life. Otherwise embolism could happen again.

This medicine is really expensive. And you know what insurance company does to not pay for it whole life? After a year they will give you much cheaper and Al oat non-effective ones. And if you have another embolism, you will get more expensive ones.

So my father need to have embolism once per year, to have proper medication! And he couldn't get it to pay for it! 

Luckily he has doctor friend, so they figured something out with it. But that second embolism was not necessary.

It's not like people doesn't want to pay more, they don't have the option. And if you'd see our hospitals...I've got lice in one. 

And this is only tip of an iceberg. So many awful stories. So...should I be grateful? When I need to spend another at least 100 dollars per month for fyziotherapy because of scoliosis? Another 100 for therapy? And what about dental? It's business here and government pays only for something. And they won't give you materials, that is paid by government. They put the most expensive ones to your mouth without telling you. Then they are surprised, that you don't have 1000 dollars in your pocket.

Think about that...and I hope that it's only exception and free healthcare doesn't look like this everywhere. I hate capitalism and when I see what capitalism did to healthcare in US, I'm genuinely sad.

P.S.: Sick leave is benefit here. You have government sick leave, but you cannot leave your house at all and you will get only 70% of salary, so everyone's taking vacation when they are sick, because with Czech wages almost nobody can afford to have lower salary.",False,n9dvul,weedarbie,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9dvul/free_healthcare_is_not_so_great_how_you_imagine_it/,25,1

2901,I realized that the hustle culture kinda starts as a kid where i live.,"I live in asia, and the culture of studying where i live is kinda bad.

like mnay kids have to go to tuition centres for hours after an already tiring school day, and some even have many  extracurriculars every week.

It's bad.

Probably caused by the fact that at 12, you have to do interviews at many schools, and 3 exams from 5th to 6th grade which secondary schools use to judge whether you're accepted or not.

also, many extra curriculars make you look great on paper, so that's a big motivator.

exams are often hard that just listening at school isn't enough, and you have to go to tuition or you're lagging behind.

I'm fortunate to not have such a jam packed sched, but the school I'm in is also kinda top, and the stress of having 16 exams 2 and a half weeks later at 13 might be the reason I was crying in class.

(no, am not making this up.)

I'm pretty sure there's kids who have no passions besides scrolling social media because they can't do anything they enjoy, every ounce of free time is crammed with study tuition and stuff.


all in all, the culture of ""winning at the starting line"" by parents cramming their kids schedules and doing it cuz other parents are doing so. it's probably also prepping em for the culture of working overtime without much pay, and not having ambitions besides work.

2902,I just came to realize how much of my expenses are work-related.,"After realizing how I hate working and that retiring early is my biggest career goal, I started tracking every expense and adopted a minimalist lifestyle allowing me to live below my means and perhaps retire a bit earlier. After doing this for some months, I  just came to realize how much of my expenses are work-related.  

The biggest one is perhaps renting an apartment in an expensive city, since cities with more jobs tend to be much more expensive to rent in. Rent in my hometown is around $300, compared to my current rent:$1500, which is the cheapest I could find.

The second one is transportation, since it’s nearly impossible to commute every day without a car (unless you live in an even more expensive part of the city)

Since I love cars, I would have gotten the car even if I didn’t have to work anyway, but the mileage, gas, and maintenance fees really add up when commuting 30 miles a day. 

The third one, perhaps less direct, but pretty common is that since I don’t have time to enjoy the little things , I tend to spend more on stuff that provide instant gratification, or have unrealistic expectations for my weekends, resulting in overspending.

Combine these three (especially the first two), and it amounts to about $2000 a month extra. 

While depressing, I started to think about the possibilities of moving back to my hometown and do my own thing. Even if I would earn more in the city, the landlords are gonna take it away anyway.",False,n9sciq,mac_128,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n9sciq/i_just_came_to_realize_how_much_of_my_expenses/,7,1

After voicing my concerns my manager has been avoiding me for 2 weeks by leaving 5 hours early every shift and sticking us with the reduced manpower. After all the shit I’ve done just for him to disrespect me like this... this subreddit is 100% right and the only thing I regret is not coming here sooner to see how much I’ve been getting abused.

2905,"Should I stick it through a horrible job to have a chance at being promoted to a better, less stressful job under the same employer?","Earlier I made a post about how I'm nearing my breaking point. Well, here it is. My job has currently gotten even worse. We've lost 5 people effectively. Our customer demand is getting higher as more and more people start coming out of quarantine and summer kicks off.

The only thing keeping me here is because, 2 days a week, I get out of the customer-facing food service hell and I get to work by myself in a one man department that I find very low stress and actually enjoyable. 

I've been told I'm next in line to manage that department and have even covered for the current manager for a whole week before. 
However I have no idea when he is leaving or moving up. He seems to be dragging his feet. Right now it's the only route I have upwards because the food service job is a dead end. 

But I just can't take it anymore. Today was awful. We barely scrape by each day. 
Horribly understaffed with constant customers. And no structure from management. No lines or signs to help keep customers in check.

No one is assigned to do one specific job for the day. We just float around hoping that our stuff gets done. I can't tell you how many times I've started a task, had to drop it for a customer. And then when finished had to immediately drop the task again because 5 people showed up out of nowhere all giving me the evil eye because I didn't immediately get on my knees to serve them. Humans were not meant to be under this much stress for 8 hours. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel like any attempt to have a conversation with my manager will fall on deaf ears because of how understaffed we are. 

I don't blame anyone for walking out on jobs like this, but I really want to have that other job because it's…
 
Consistent scheduling.
Consistent workload.
Little to no customer interaction.
40 hours a week with benefits and pay raise.
Covering for the current manager was the easiest 40 hours of my life. But is it worth it to be worked like a dog in the other department until the current manager moves on?

The normal wageslave starts their day at 5:am, waking up feeling tired

and depressed at the notion of another day at work. They don't have time
for any personal activities, as their entire morning ritual revolves around
preparing for work (unpaid preparation).

 

The wageslave barely has time for breakfast, forcing himself to eat an unhealthy,
high calorie collection of must in order to function throughout the day.

 

The wageslave has been in his car for the last 2 hours and only managed to travel half
a mile from his home! But hey, he's gutta leave early to make sure his boss can afford
a new boat this summer!

 

Is it only 10AM? The normal wageslave still has another 9 hours of work before he
can head home!

  

You better work harder wageslave, otherwise your boss won't be able to afford
that private jet he had his eyes on!

 

Payday... well, obviously your boss needed to take his profits,
oh and your taxes had to go towards our NET friend, oh and
then there are your bills, your mortgage, your insurance... But
hey, you might be able to survive on that?

 

9PM, better get to bed wageslave! You don't want to be tired for

yourself today, but you'll get a few hours on the weekend if your
boss doesn't call you into work!

2964,I feel like I discovered a cheat code.,"I'm 27 (M). I grew up extremely poor in the American South (We literally didn't have a front door) As a kid I daydreamed about how awesome my life would be living in the big city with a fancy job and 40 dollar haircut and money to blow in my bank account.  Like most of you all I ever heard was get a good job with benefits, work yourself to death for 40 years and move to Florida (Florida probably won't even exist in 40 years)  After high school I joined the Military to pay for college . When I returned stateside I went to college and ended up with a graduate degree and shortly thereafter moved to California for a ""great"" job before I realized what a long con this entire deal is. Why am I working full time with a 2 hour commute each day to barely afford to pay rent and jam down processed foods that are slowly killing me? Maybe this situation made my RESUME look good, but fuck a resume, if I hate working in general, why would I care if this piece of paper makes me attractive to other employers, who I don't want to work for? I was flabbergasted that having a ""good"" job was barely enough to sustain myself and sad for other people in a similar boat. Most Americans work full time and yet most can not afford to come up with 400 dollars for an emergency. That is a con.  It was a hard pill to shallow that almost every working person is having their labor and time on Earth exploited for the benefit of the rich, but once you understand that you can change the rules of the game.

I created a budget to understand what it was that I needed to sustain a fulfilling life for myself. If I could really figure out how much money I NEEDED to make to support the life I WANTED, I could eliminate a lot of waste along the way, even if that meant quitting my job.   If I could go a week without any given expense, I probably didn't need it, and therefore I shouldn't be spending money on it. I realized that the only thing I really needed was food, water and shelter, and novel entertainment, which basically means internet connection. Everything else is just very crafty corporation messaging.. I think this thinking goes back to when I was a child and living in poverty. We didn't have much of anything, but I sort of got used to being able to live without much.  I also had to figure out how much I could realistically make on the internet in any given month. I have several little side hustles that I've picked up over the years. I figured that my largest expense was housing, and I absolute had to move somewhere more affordable. Maybe even the town I grow up in. Since my job is/was WFH, I bought a house with 0 down in a rural area for under 100k. The mortgage is literally $1500 less than what I was paying in rent in California. All of my bills combined average around $800 per month.  I quit my job the day after closing and will never work for another employer again. 

I've been here about a month now and not having to wake up at the crack of dawn to join pointless zoom meetings is honestly just the best feeling. I am going to build a chicken coup out back and put up some garden beds and spend the entire summer in my backyard in peace and quiet.

The absolute best advice I can give anybody looking to escape the rat race is to buy property somehow cheap and give up the notion that you absolutely have to make millions of dollars to be happy.  I will probably crack 30k this year and I have everything I need and more.  If you live in the US, you can get a USDA loan (0% down) to buy property in a rural area. ""Rural"" being very subjective depending on where you are and want to live.  I plan on becoming aggressive and paying this off within this decade, and then life the rest of my life mortgage free, so I'll have to work even less!

Last one I went to was all about giving up the lattes and meat once or twice a week to make up for the loss in take home pay when we do try to contribute to our 401ks.

Last meeting I went to where it was my peers in the same pay grade I stood up and pulled a Katie Porter.

I then asked him the average rental for a one bedroom, (1200 dollars)  and average food costs for a family of four, health premium and so forth.

2975,The time I quit after one shift.,"A few years ago I got a part-time job working in the kitchen of a burger restaurant. I had a training shift/interview for 3 hours which was actually super laid back. They taught me to properly cut vegetables, mix the meat and herbs, etc. Everyone was happy and we had music on. I even was told I could ""take breaks whenever"" and literally got to cook myself burgers to eat ""whenever you feel like it"".

A few days later I went to my first proper (Friday) shift (working 2-10pm) and it was literal hell. Got yelled at by the ""head chef"" (who was younger than me, not that it makes much difference but yeah). The manager was in the back room watching tv. From walking in at 2 until about 8.30pm I was unable to go to the toilet, eat or drink anything, or rest at all. I was also being micro-bullied by some of the wait staff. By then I made up my mind to quit after the second Saturday shift, but little did I know things just got worse.

Last orders were finally at 9pm, so we finished cooking the last burger and started cleaning. Great - now time to quickly clean and go home, right? Wrong. 10pm came, waitresses still bringing me shit to clean and smugly mocking me for still having work when they were going home. Meanwhile, the other kitchen staff were literally dancing around to the radio *instead of cleaning*, meaning that we didn't finish until 1am. 3 hours after my shift was supposed to end. 

On the way out, it took me 10 minutes to leave the mall as the main exits were closed. A chef from another restaurant had to show me how to get out. When I told her I wasn't going back, she was all like ""don't do that, just think of your colleagues"". Fuck no - they didn't think about me when they were slacking off, delaying our end by 3 hours.

Once I finally navigated out of the mall, I spent half my earnings on a taxi home (no buses running). Safe to say, I blocked the manager's number and got a job the next week at a betting shop/bookies which mostly involved chatting, being on our phones, playing demos on the slot machines, making coffee for punters, and having banter with local drunks.",False,n8cxgo,grahco,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n8cxgo/the_time_i_quit_after_one_shift/,17,1

unemployment. Good for them for being able to
avoid working for poverty wages for you to bitch
they didn't roll enough silverware after working 8

more. May better and treat your staff better, like
give them breaks and free food? By job has given

His bad argument is everywhere. Of someone's labor

$15 is losing $7/he on that person.

 

To the ""viable business model"" is to stop hiring low-
skilled workers, rather than lose money on them. And
that doesn't help the workers.

But differently, the issue isn’t the business model, its some workers who

don’t add large value.

And a “viable business mode!” doesn often include financing their own
welfare system, paying workers far above their labor's value & taking
responsibility for their family finances.

Recently our home minister was exposed in a scandal where he was extorting 1 billion rupees (USD 14 million) EVERY FREAKING MONTH from high end bars and clubs in his constituency. Google anil deshmukh expose if you wanna know more about that. 

Meanwhile the vast majority of our country still lives on less than $5 a day. No matter which political party comes, they all do the same. Just that some are less corrupt than others. For the people it's like choosing to make a vote between rat poison or stale bread. I'm assuming the same is the case with all poor countries ie. Two thirds of the world. This is what is wrong with the world. Theres not one hygienic public washroom where we live despite Lamborghini and Mercedes Benz showrooms having arrived from overseas.

The fact that we are expected to be okay working 8+ hours a day for 5-7 days a week 50 weeks out of the year.

3131,I hate being called lazy for wanting to work remotely. That’s not at all how I operate.,"First off, let me clarify that if you prefer being in an office, for whatever reason, that’s fine. To each their own. 

I deal with mental health issues, including really bad GAD, SAD, and a little OCD. Being in an office triggers all of them. I am, quite literally, DRAINED by the time Friday comes around. 

I much prefer to work from the comfort of my own home, for many reasons. 

1. I live alone. I can watch YouTube, take video game breaks, or go for a walk to take a breather. 

2. I don’t have to pretend to look busy when I’m not working for fear of seeming lazy. 

3. I don’t have to deal with catty, fake, boring office people who don’t know what to do with their time besides gossip and talk about mundane things.

4. I am a creative type person, so being in an office makes me feel like I’d stand out for daring to question things or seem quirky (see: mental illness). 

5. Saving money on gas, takeout, car maintenance, etc plus living in a neater environment does wonders for me. Especially with student loan payments, which I’m sure most of you can relate to. 

6. The convenience. In an office, if you want to take a nap, have fun finding somewhere. You gotta lay down in your car. Gotta make food? Wait for four people to make their food first! Gotta poop? Wait for the shit stained toilets to open up!

I mean, I can go on.

Again, if you prefer offices, that’s OKAY. But many people DO NOT, and their eyes have been opened to how their quality of life improves.

3137,"I kinda agree with yall, (from an economically right and social right)","First If I want to say socially I am extremely rightwing because I'm am Muslim also I am economically rightwing.

What does that mean? I don't agree with the current economy and society that perpetuates the economy 

The modern American economy is 20% government. It overprinted to sustain in causing inheritance things like wage stagnation, high government spending, and high taxation. I think it's utterly stupid to tax people 10% and corporations 20% regardless of size from my uncle's crappy 60K lawn scaping S-corp to tesla. It's horrible for the workers. We need a new moral taxing system where we tax people based on usage but universal taxable things like regardless will be taxed for military and your local roads, I don't believe a struggling person should pay for schooling because property taxes where its the landlord tricking it down to them or it's their property. 

I believe Women shouldn't be in the workforce and should be banned for wage decrease and to fix the SCREAMING population crisis also the mental health crisis. Woman in the workplace is ruining our society they are ""independent"" so the work beside us taking half our pay so if a man wants a family he has half the income now to sustain a family. A banned woman from the workplace but from a job like teachers etc. They go to college to get 70% of all college debt which we will default on because of the government's debt Leamon brothers 2008 on crack. They can just stay at home and take care of the kids while the man now has double the income. Yes, the effect of globalism and urbanization is strong but it work the try, just do what japan does but the opposite.

Lower taxes, deregulate wages like that stupid 15$ so I can negotiate for 20$ and not be slapped by labor unions, cause hyperinflation and pay off all debt, banned feminism, Ban corporate loopholes, ban the IRS, abolish the college system internally, deregulate the economy, lower interest rates, make taxes subscription-based, ban property taxes, give incentives to first-time homebuyers.

3138,My Story,"I've been a lurker in this sub for some time now and have noticed alot of you are ok with working if it's from home, so I figured I would share my story with all of you.

I own a small tech company of about 100 people and we were like any other company before covid hit. We had an office and everyone came to work, did there time, then went home except I gave the choice of of 4, 10 hour days or 5, 8 hour days. 

When covid hit I sent everyone home except for 5 people who run the servers. They did what they could at home, but had 2 come in each day to check physical things. Throughout 2020 I met regularly over the phone or through video chat with managers and the co-owner and discussed general moral. It seemed everyone was generally happier being at home than in the office, which looking back at it now I kinda feel like and idiot for not realizing that sooner. 

3rd quarter of last year the company was doing really well so I brought up an idea with the co-owner and I sent out a mass email to the whole company. I gave everyone a budget to set up a home office if needed and would reimburse them up to said amount and offered any assistance if needed. 

As far as my server guys goes, I definitely did not forget about them. I gave them a choice of either working from home and going in 1 day a week or going into work 4 days and taking a salary increase. All 5 of them agreed to take the 4 days and salary increase. So to make things easier for them and me, we sold the old building and bought a building that was cheaper and closer to all 5 of their houses to make the drive easier to the point where the longest drive is 12 mins. 

Now, once a quarter I meet in person with the co-owner and all the managers to discuss various things and I told the rest of my employees that as long as projects get done I don't care if they work 1 hour a day or 10. 

All in all, moral is through the roof and I regret not doing this sooner.

3141,I'm only starting to realise how linked to capitalism everything is,"I grew up wanting to be a professor at a University. I always got joy from teaching people and reading/doing exploratory work. That was the thing that gave me joy.

But then I was always told not to. Because ""researchers don't actually contribute anything. They just make theories that mean nothing. The industry is where actual work happens. And because of that, you get more money too"" 

It only just hit me how fucked up that is. The worth of your work is only based on if a billionaire could use your work to buy a private island. And sure, I could earn 100K a year and be well off, but if I put year or more on the project, the company uses that to make millions. the CEO uses that to give themselves a raise and does an interview about how they are commited to changing the world. Forbes calls them a revolutionary.

Are you seriously going to tell me that teaching Undergrads to fall in love with engineering is less important than that? A high school teacher is just as important as an engineer working for Facebook. It's one thing for there to be a difference in pay, but seriously!

People want you to believe that Elon Musk is a revolutionary for making electric cars. Nope.

If he was a revolutionary, he'd be making those cars affordable. Right now, the only people who can afford a Tesla are the people who'd normally drive their BMW and on weekends, they'd have the hard choice of ""Lambo or Tesla?"". He wouldn't mark up those prices and exploit factory workers either. He'd actually share patents so Honda, Toyota, Kia and everyone else could make similar cars. Do you realise how much he could do for sustainability and the environment if he wanted to?

If every company had an electric car sold at the same price as petrol cars, we could actually protect the fucking environment. But instead, we get Elon Musk on SNL. 


They tell us that sex work isn't working cause sex workers are ""exploited and selling their body."" Ah yes, and most underpaid people at call centres are living out their life's dreams, right? They aren't being exploited or anything. Not like they are losing sleep every night cause of work hours. Not like they aren't getting abused by their managers and customers.

Then they say that paying for sex work on OF and other sites is ""simply"". Bruh, I'd rather pay someone directly for her work than pay some big studio like Brazzers for shitty porn to let some rich guy get richer.



We've been raised to think that value comes from making the people richer than us happy and that anything else is a waste. We've been conditioned to accept that someone working for a company is more valuable than a professor, just cause of capitalism. Do you really think that everything a company does is groundbreaking? Google has had products no one ever used cause they were so shit. They've had a bunch of things they tried to invent that didn't even get released. There are so many companies that just rehash what others did before. Don't act like they "" contributed to society"" they created a new product.

Do you think everyone at Microsoft is doing worthwhile work? Far from it.

We've normalised the fact that Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk and everyone else could jerk off 24/7 and still make millions of dollars every month just through underpaying people.

I'm beyond angered (disturbed, more than anything) by the responses business owners and managers have had towards this whole underemployment issue. 

People aren't incentivized to go to work because **you don't pay them enough, you don't offer benefits, you offer shit working conditions** \- *THAT* is why people aren't flocking to you. They're getting what they need from PUA because it more accurately matches what something like minimum wage should provide a worker. 

$290/wk is pathetic, plain and simple. Not to mention that the *same companies complaining about not getting enough applicants are the same companies that* ***won't even offer full-time pay, and therefore any benefits*** to the majority of their workers. But they're just lazy and on PUA, right? It's not you gaming the system and exploiting the most at-risk, vulnerable demographics (oh, the irony!).

Look. We're a tiny group of people compared to the rest of the population, but we're capable of a lot if we set our minds to it. I'll preface this by saying that I have low expectations, but big dreams. 

Do you guys think we have the collective power to help combat those large companies that mistreat their workers and who operate with indifference towards human life? Do you guys think we can organize boycotts? Or do you think **anyone** would do so, assuming we continue on our current trajectory?

I'm sick and tired of seeing those assholes get away with so much, to succeed with such little dignity, of seeing them vilify the poor and working-class the way they do. I'm **S I C K** of it. I want us to do something that hits them right in the gut, and the easiest way is to simply **stop giving them our money.** Simple as that. Stop giving your business to companies that don't respect their employees like human beings, that talk down on them, that assume the worst about all of us, and who currently know they'll get away with running on the same model of exploitation.

3165,These are the words you have been looking for,"**1. The Panopticon**

In 1791, English philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham proposed a new kind of prison. The prison was round with cells on the outer walls. In the center was a tower manned by one or more guards. From the tower, guards had a direct view into each cell. Prisoners had no privacy. Everything they did was visible. 

The view into the tower however was blocked. So, while the guards could see each inmate, the inmates could never see the guards. This, was the first surveillance state. A population controlled not by force but by an asymmetric vision. The genius of the system was that the prisoners never knew when they were being surveilled, and thus had to assume they were always being watched. They would therefore, surveil themselves, censoring their own behavior to conform to the will of the invisible eye in the central tower. Each prisoner became complicit in their own subjugation. 

Bentham called his prison, the panopticon. Greek for all seeing. He described it as a new mode of power. Of mind over mind. In essence, the panopticon replaced the social control exercised by an all-seeing, all-powerful god, with an all-seeing, and all-powerful state apparatus. For the prisoners, the state had become the new god. 

**2. The Electronic Panopticon**

This was the mode of social control George Orwell predicted in his book *1984*. In that book, the technology is electronic, but the principles remain the same. The hero, Winston Smith, and the citizens of his country Oceania are controlled by an asymmetric vision. In every room, in every apartment, there’s a so-called telescreen that delivers state propaganda, but whose real function is as a surveillance camera that can never be turned off. Each telescreen weaponizes the gaze of state power — The Ministry of Truth. 

Oceania itself has become a surveillance state —a prison— and the citizens assume they are always being surveilled. As with the prisoners, the citizens of Oceania become complicit in their own subjugation. Censoring their behavior to conform to the will of the all-seeing and all-powerful state. Big Brother is watching you. 

Orwell died in 1950 fearing his vision of a totalitarian state order might still come to pass. Yet today, only a handful of societies would qualify as Orwellian surveillance states. North Korea. Urban China. And, of course, Disneyland. Orwell’s vision of the panopticon state, that exercised control over its population through surveillance and fear, never took route in the liberal West. Orwell’s fears, it seems, were unfounded. 

But perhaps Orwell’s vision was not wrong, but merely naïve. Perhaps, the panopticon state was superseded by a newer, more efficient, and more subtle mode of power and social control. 

**3. The Real 1984**

In the book *1984*, a weaponized gaze is directed from a powerful and invisible center to a powerless and visible periphery. In the year 1984 however, everything was reversed. No-one had a surveillance camera in their home. Everyone, however, had a television. Which they watched, on average, six-hours a day. 

In the *year* 1984, the center was still powerful and the periphery powerless – but the center is visible and the periphery invisible. Those in power are visible and omnipresent, those on the periphery are unseen, and anonymous. The population is controlled through the images from the center. Of wealth, youth, beauty, and sex. The basis of control is not fear, but desire. This is not the hard totalitarianism of surveillance and fear, but a soft totalitarianism of consumerism, advertising, and the mass production of desire. This is the new mode of power. Of mind over mind. The reverse panopticon. But how does this power work? And what ideology does it use to justify itself? If advertising is the propaganda of consumerism, what does advertising tell us about the ideology it serves? 

**4. The Ideology of Consumerism**

Every ideology creates a narrative of our lives. A three-act story of problem, struggle, and reward. In Christianity, the problem is we are enslaved by sin. The struggle is faith and good works, the reward, is heaven. For Marx, we are enslaved by class exploitation, the struggle is revolution, and the reward is a classless society. For Freud, we are enslaved by neurotic unhappiness. The struggle is therapy, and the reward, as Freud himself said, is ordinary human misery. 

In each narrative, humans are posited to be flawed, and therefore unfree. It is only through struggle of faith, of revolution, of therapy, that we free ourselves from our flaws, and find fulfillment. So what is the narrative of consumerism? What is the flaw we must overcome, to find fulfillment? 

The story, consumerism tells us, is that we are by nature, desiring beings. The problem is that we desire goods and services. The struggle is to work and make money. And the reward, if we succeed, is to become rich and to thereby fulfill our desires. The source of our discontents, consumerism tells us, is not sin, or exploitation, or neurosis, but desire. And our endless thirst for its fulfillment. 

**5. The Cult of the Winner**

The standard critique of consumerism tells us that our desires are not natural, but rather fabricated by the machinery of consumerism itself. Thus, consumerism does not manufacture products in order to satisfy desires, rather its fundamental task is to manufacture desire, in order to sell products. 

But not all desires are equal. Big cars have a higher profit margin than small cars. New clothes have a higher profit margin than used clothes. Processed foods have a higher profit margin than raw foods. So, by the logic of consumerism, goods that are new or big or processed are more desirable than the small or recycled or raw. This is the standard critique of consumerism we are all familiar with. That advertising is capitalist propaganda designed to induce us to buy stuff we don’t need, with money we don’t have, to impress people we don’t know. What Thorstein Veblen in 1925 called ‘[conspicuous consumption](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/833).’ 

Yet Veblen went a step further. For him, consumption was not about desire —that was a fig leaf to disguise its true nature— rather, conspicuous consumption was about class hierarchy and social status. We do not buy a Rolex because it tells time more accurately. We do not buy a Ferrari to drive to work more quickly. Rather, we buy these things to advertise our place within a hierarchy of status and respectability. 

As Veblen observed, the more useful and utilitarian a good or service was, the lower its perceived status was. Thus, the lower status conferred on farming, plumbing and sanitation. Conversely, the more unnecessary a good or service —the more useless and conspicuously wasteful— the higher its status. Thus, the high status conferred on diamonds, yachts, works of art, movie stars, and post-graduate education. Consumerism was less about the fulfillment of desire than the pursuit of status, through the purchase and display of conspicuously useless and wasteful goods and services. To Veblen, this was the underlying ideology of consumerism. That life is a competition for status, for respect, for the esteem of others. And the way we win status —the measure of our lives, and our worth as human beings— is through our ability to purchase and consume as conspicuously and wastefully as possible. These values of conspicuous and wasteful consumption add up to a vision of life that might be termed, ‘the Cult of the Winner.’ 

The winner, owns a big expensive house. He drives a big expensive car. Everything the winner owns is new, big, expensive and therefore as conspicuously wasteful as possible. Anyone who falls short of such a life, implicitly, is a loser. 

**6. The Ultimate Winner**

Today, the hierarchies of status have evolved. There is still the ethos of materialist consumption —mansions, sports cars, yachts— but this is increasingly the province of Russian oligarchs, and the nouveau riche. Today there is also an ethos of non-materialist consumption. The elite, travel to distant and obscure destinations, attend silent meditation retreats, earn doctorate degrees. They visit museums, attend symphonies, read the latest bestseller, and otherwise engage in the consumption of cultural capital. While avoiding the vulgar materialism of the gilded age, they nevertheless advertise their status through the profligate expenditure of disposable time and non-productive effort. Yoga resorts. Culinary tours. Gap years. Semesters abroad. Graduate degrees. These are the new status markers. 

None of these things however can make one a real winner. To be a real winner today, it is no longer enough to be well traveled, well read, well connected. It is no longer enough to be merely rich. The ultimate reward in Christianity is heaven, the ultimate reward in Marxism is a classless society. What then is the ultimate reward in consumerism? Here we borrow an insight from [Slavog Zizek](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Slavog+Zizek&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web). The ultimate want, Zizek tells us, it to be wanted. “The ultimate desire is to be desired.” 

So, the ultimate achievement in consumerism is to become wanted and desired. To turn oneself into a product. To become famous. To be a celebrity. Within a consumer society, this successful celebrity achieves a kind of secular transcendence. A holy status. By turning him or herself into a brand. An object. Something that can be bought or sold. To succeed in consumerism —to win at being a winner— it is no longer enough to be rich. One must also become famous. And the more attention you attract, the more clicks you generate, the higher the ratings, the bigger the winner you are. 

**7. The New Big Brother**

Which brings us, unavoidably to the figure of Donald trump. The makers of this have no interest in litigating trumps politics. Trump himself seems to have no real interest in politics per say. What he cares about is ratings and reviews and crowd size. Trump inherited his wealth, 400 million, from his father. But being rich wasn’t enough. He pursued the spotlight of celebrity and became a household name, an image, a brand. After six bankruptcies, he left real estate for showbiz — to be on TV once a week. Then left showbiz for politics – to be on TV every day. He transformed himself from an outer borough rich kid to the inescapable center of the world’s attention economy. In doing so, he made himself into the ultimate winner. 

Trump exercises power not through surveillance, but through the dominance of public attention. As such, Trump represents the ultimate reversal of the panopticon, and the final inversion of Orwell’s vision. 

Today, Big Brother is no longer watching us. Today, we are all watching Big Brother. 

“My whole life I’ve been greedy, greedy, greedy, greedy. I’ve trapped all the money I can get, I’m so greedy.”  Donald Trump

Trump is too easily dismissed as his critiques as a vulgar clown, the reality TV star who turned reality itself into a show and made himself the star. But he may also be seen as a cautionary tale. The apotheosis of the cult of the winner. Trump’s entire life is an exercise in branding. He puts his name on everything he acquires. Hotels, casinos, planes, wives, children –all beautiful, wasteful, and useless– and offers them up for public display. 

“We’re going to win so much; you may even get tired of winning.” Donald Trump. 
 
His life, a mobius loop of television appearances and television consumption, of tweets and retweeting, suggests a hall of mirror narcissism, that is the reductio ad absurdum of our consumerism culture. 

But this hall of mirrors narcissism —this feedback loop of performance and review— is no longer the province of the rich and famous. Today, the culture of narcissism is for everyone. Today, everyone can be a winner. 

**8. Everyone’s a Winner!**

In the year 1984, power worked on a broadcast model — stories and images were produced at the center by the rich and famous. The rest of us sat on the periphery and watched. To be visible was to be a winner. To be anonymous was not. As a mode of social control, the reverse panopticon worked. Mesmerized by images of wealth and beauty —seized by the desire for status and social distinction— the population was rendered docile by the hamster wheel of consumerism. Working longer and longer hours, to buy more and more stuff. Debt and obesity sky rocketed. As did corporate profits, CEO pay, and income inequality. 

The soft totalitarianism of consumerism proved to be more comprehensive and effective in controlling the population than the hard totalitarianism that Orwell feared. By 1990 – McDonald’s was in Red Square. 

Thirty years later however, the old broadcast model is obsolete. Today, everyone has a camera and a TV station in their pocket. Today, everyone can generate their own images, tell their own stories. But rather than tell new stories, we often retell the old one. Casting ourselves in the lead role. We curate images of ourselves not as we are, but as we wish to be seen. As winners. Like Trump, our lives become a performance — an exercise in self-branding for an invisible and all-seeing audience. Rather than escape the reverse panopticon, we have internalized it. And we monitor our ratings as obsessively as Trump does. How many clicks, how many likes, how many followers. 

Once, the big eye watching over us belonged to god. In *1984*, the big eye belonged to the state. Today, it is the audience —invisible, and omnipresent, punishing and rewarding, judgemental and wrathful, all-seeing and all-powerful— that has become the new god. 

As exhibitionists we have all become Winston Smith. As voyeurs, we have all become Big Brother. 

The genius of the old panopticon was that prisoners presumed they were under constant surveillance, and so modified their behavior even if nobody was watching. Today, we live in a state of self-surveillance and modify our behavior accordingly. Acting out the role of the winner. Even if no one is watching. As such, we have become complicit in our own subjugation. 

**9. Welcome to the Machine**

For most of Western history the classic virtues were unchanging. Hard work, thrift, humility, charity, mercy, chasteness, generosity. Everything your mother taught you. 

As Max Weber pointed out – early capitalism derived much of its underlying ethos from the protestant work ethic. To be rich, was proof of one’s hard work and thrift. Respectability was a sign of chasteness and humility. Status was derived from charity, fellowship, generosity. In 1889, Andrew Carnegie wrote, “surplus wealth is a sacred trust, which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime, for the good of the community.” He concluded, “the man who dies rich, dies disgraced.” 

Today, social Darwinism has replaced Christianity as the underlying ethos of capitalism. Consumerism has turned these values on their heads. Instead of restraint, it celebrates gluttony. Instead of modesty - lust. Instead of generosity - greed. Instead of humility - pride. Instead of kindness - envy. Instead of mercy - wrath. Instead of hard work - sloth. With few exceptions, consumerism promotes and celebrates values that were once seen as the path to ruin and despair. And so, we become ever more anxious, stressed, distracted, depressed, overweight, sleep deprived, in debt, dissatisfied. So, who’s to blame for this mess? Who are the bad guys in this story?

At this point the standard critique tends to find an easy villain in the rich and powerful — Wall Street, Madison Avenue, Hollywood. But this ignores a more complicated truth. It is a truism today that fame can be a prison. In winning fame, one loses anonymity. Privacy. The freedom to move through the world unmolested by the gaze of the camera. But the cult of the winner may also be a mental prison for those at the top, who like Trump, spend their lives chasing after the applause of the crowd and the phantoms of status. As such, the self-branded celebrity is merely the most obvious victim of the reverse panopticon state. As any supermarket tabloid will attest. 

Who then benefits from the system of over-consumption, narcissism, and self-surveillance? And how does one escape?

**10. The Matrix**

Remember those movies where aliens invade the earth? Take over the government? And plunder the environment? Humans are brainwashed and cast into servitude, working ceaselessly to enrich their alien overlords? In these movies there’s often a class of pod people who collaborate with the aliens and enjoy a modicum of privilege. And there’s a handful of freedom fighters — a scrappy band of misfits who live outside the system and fight back against the soulless aliens and their bootlicking human collaborators. 

Today, this is not a movie. Today, this is your life. Today the aliens who have plundered the environment and taken over the government are called corporations. You may not have declared war on them, but they have declared on you. Every second of every day, the machine works to make you addicted to sugar, fat, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, gasoline, debt, political outrage, and social media. 

Every second of every day the machine seeks to take your money, your time. To capture your attention and your data, commodify them and sell them to advertisers. Every second of every day, the machine works to make you consume as wastefully and as conspicuously as possible. Food, medication, goods and services, leisure. To do so, the machine wants you to become envious, greedy, gluttonous, lustful, wrathful, prideful, and slothful. A class of pod people collaborate with these aliens and enjoy a modicum of privilege. But in the end, they are just as indentured as everyone else. No one is more servile to the corporation, than the CEO. 

Who then, are the freedom fighters? And how does one fight back?

**11. The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.**

The genius of the soft totalitarian state is that it’s voluntary. We are complicit in our own subjugation. But that means we also have the freedom to opt out. If you own a lot of stuff —big expensive stuff— maybe you’re not a winner. Maybe you’re a cog in the machine. On the other hand, if you only own what you need, and your stuff is inexpensive or recycled, maybe you’re not a loser. Maybe you’re a freedom fighter. And the freedom you’re fighting for, is your own. 

So maybe, an apple, is better than a bag of chips. A glass of water is better than a big gulp. A book, is better than a TV. A second-hand store, is cooler than a boutique. An old bike is better than a new Ferrari. A cheap rent, is better than an expensive mortgage. 

In her career, Dorothea Lange took thousands of photographs of migrant workers, sharecroppers, prisoners. In doing so, she changed the way America saw itself. Her camera —facing outwards— was a tool of art. In her lifetime, she posed for a single self-portrait. In 2015, Kim Kardashian published a 450-page book of selfies. It was titled, ‘Selfish.’ Her camera —facing inwards— was a narcissistic mirror. 

Kardashian, like Trump, is a celebrity, a brand, a product. As a winner in the economy of attention and addict in the culture of narcissism, she has made herself prisoner both internally and externally, of the reverse panopticon state. 

Like Winston Smith, her life is dominated by the camera. And by the invisible audience on the other side of the lens.

In the book *1984*, power is exercised through fear, coercion, surveillance. Being watched by those at the top. Today, power is exercised through the mass production of desire, weaponized status competition, and the hegemony of the spectator society. Of watching those at the top. 

You can watch corporate sports, or play sport yourself. You can watch corporate musicians, or make your own music. You can watch a corporate talk show, or enjoy a conversation. You can take the blue pill of consumerism, and spend the rest of your life staring at a screen —passive, docile, a cog in the machine— or, you can live your life. 

In *1984*, Winston Smith didn’t have a choice. The telescreen in his apartment could never be turned off. You have a screen. In your house. On your desk. In your hand. You are giving it your attention right now. 
But you can turn it off. 

**12. You Must Change Your Life**

Every ideology presents itself as the natural order of things. Christianity and Marxism are monotheisms that explain the world, and give us values and ideals that govern our lives. Today, consumerism has become its own monotheism. So invisible and ubiquitous it’s like the water we swim in. What is the point of life, if not to be a winner? To what should we aspire if not to be rich and famous. Here the standard critique returns us to the classic virtues. Kindness. Charity. Thrift. Humility. Mercy. Generosity. To be a good person. Like your mother taught you. 
The makers of this have nothing against the classic virtues –or against your mother– but perhaps there is something else we can aspire to. Better than being a winner. Or a ‘good’ person. Perhaps, we may aspire to become ourselves. 
Perhaps the monotheism of consumerism can be replaced —not be another monotheism— but by a kind of ideological polytheism. 

Let us return to the narrative of problem, struggle, reward. For a Buddhist, the problem is suffering. The struggle is meditation. The reward is tranquillity and perhaps enlightenment. For the scholar, the problem is ignorance, the struggle is study, and the reward is knowledge and perhaps even wisdom. For the activist, the problem is injustice, the struggle is activism, and the reward is social progress – perhaps even justice. 

In each case the self begins as raw and unformed, and is transformed through a regime of daily practice. The transformation of the self —from uncultivated to cultivated, from ordinary to extraordinary— is a struggle of daily and deliberate practice. Of exertion and exhaustion. Of trial and error. Of self-challenge and self-overcoming. Nietzsche called it, “The struggle to become what one is.”

The cultivation of the self requires exertion, risk, perseverance, discipline, exhaustion, and the inevitability of disappointment. Falling short. **Failure.** 

It requires that you challenge yourself. That you become active. 

This, is what consumerism seeks to thwart. What consumerism wants, above all, is to make us passive. To make us alienated. From our lives. From our labor. From our friends, and family, and loved ones, and neighbors. To make us laze at home, clicking endless links while watching other people talk, and cook, and play their sports, and make their music, and have their sex, and live their lives. To make us spectators. Cogs in the machine. Consumers. 

We all have one life. One chance –regardless of age– to become whomever we might be. And just as we struggle to free ourselves —from sin, from exploitation, from our own neurosis— we may also struggle to free ourselves from the reverse panopticon of consumerism, and the cult of the winner. We may therefore win the freedom to choose our own path. To pursue our own ideals.

The Christian gives up everything to become a saint. The Buddhist gives up everything for enlightenment. The radical gives up everything to change the world. The surfer, lives for the wave. The climber, risks everything for the climb…

No one can tell you who you are, or what you may become.

Your life, is your life.

And you are the author of your self.

3170,I'm just...tired,"Depressing rant time? Depressing rant time. (I'm sorry, I'm not really looking for advice or to open a dialogue, I just wanted to get this out. Mods, I apologize if this is too much for this sub. I just can't sleep.)

My whole life, the sentiment that not wanting to work was lazy hippie crybaby bullshit was...well never really ""drilled into me"" but sorta felt like it was. Nobody was ever there telling me that verbatim, but kinda reading the room it always had that air to it. That it's just what you do and you need to live with it. I don't want to get into my employment history or how I currently make my wages, but the long and short of it is that I'm just tired. I'm genuinely at a loss for how else to put it at this point. The feeling is just...empty exhaustion. I have so little time in this meaningless short life. There is so little time, and I know, every day, when I crawl out of bed, I'm going to be spending my waking hours thinking about money. How to make it, how to spend it carefully, who I can spend it on and responsibly (or irresponsibly for some in particular) in what quantity, where I can get more and if it's efficient enough of a means to pursue. It's always about money. Everything. 

I can't look at anything without attaching a price tag to it anymore and it's sickening. Nothing too small, even just dings and dents in the walls I ponder if it's worth the time to ask my landlord if I could take some money off this month if I fix them around the apartment. There's a decent chance they'd say yes, but I'm too tired to even ask. Every facet of my life, every waking thought, it all just goes back to money. And honestly, I can't really recall the last time I took a significant chunk out of a day to sit back and think about what I want to do and what would make me happy if I did it. Something just completely detached from money. Because every hobby I might think up, I have to ask myself ""is this profitable enough to sustain and could I sell the fruits of this hobby to fund it in the first place"" and suddenly I don't care anymore because I just feel drained by the idea. If I do find something I enjoy and it starts to develop those little price tags, I lose interest because looking at it starts to remind me of the very thing I was avoiding by doing it in the first place.

The knowledge that I will likely be spending every moment of my life until I die having to think about money just every. single. day. feels choking. 

I've never fantasized about wealth beyond the notion that maybe, if some miracle hits me, maybe I could just stop. Maybe the leaking faucet wouldn't remind me of money. The loaf of bread every time it's a slice thinner. The last week of every month. The gas meter when I start my car and the odometer when I park it inching closer to the next oil change. The hum of my fridge compressor kicking on burning kW/h. Every upcoming holiday and birthday...maybe all of it would stop. Maybe if I were wealthy, maybe then these would go away. Because every single one of them serves to remind me that I'll never have enough for it to go away completely. I will always be chasing the dollar and it will consume my thoughts for the rest of my life.

And supposing it didn't? Maybe I get a reasonable 9-5 and it *is* enough and I can retire and live comfortably? In my limited time on this planet, after which I cease to exist and everything I have ever done and worked for meant nothing? That I had to spend 2/3 of it toiling away just to enjoy the remaining 1/3? It's crushing. It feels....heavy. Deep in my chest this sinking pit that just keeps filling with gravel. Because for the most part, I know it's just inevitable.

In truth, I really hate money. In such a post-scarcity world, where there is more than enough of everything for everyone to be comfortable in every country on Earth...having come so far that basic necessities like food, water, and shelter are all but completely automated processes...that this is still something to even think about...god it sounds like such ""libtard commie bullshit"" as some might put it and hell, ya know what maybe it is, but *fuck* I don't care about the tax impliocations or the ins and outs of who's paying who however much or for what. Just the notion that we have the means but not the will to end this miserable, pointless struggle for millions upon millions of people and we just don't. It's infuriating. But I can't even bring myself to be mad about it anymore because I've exhausted myself holding onto that feeling. It's...almost like when you shake a 2L bottle of soda. You see all the fizz rush to the top but you don't open it. You just watch the bubbles rise up in a torrent and if you release the pressure by juuust cracking the seal, in a few seconds you see it all fall back down and fizzle out. Doesn't overflow.

3187,"Have a decent job, still want to quit. Advice?","So, I work at a thrift store. I love going there as a customer and have been going there since I was a kid. They’re paying me a dollar over minimum wage (in Colorado, it’s $12.32, they’re paying me $13.30ish). It seems like they do care about us there, we have benefits and it’s fairly laid back. But physical labor is physical labor no matter how you cut it up. I keep looking back at how I used to live, waking up whenever I wanted and getting to make my own decisions about what I want to do in the day— and I miss it. I did feel kind of useless w/o a job and having the one I’m working now makes me feel less like a loser, but I’m only 18 and my body feels like it’s 90. I’m too exhausted to really go out and do anything on my weekends because I just want to rest and try to recharge before I have to force myself to get up at 6 am in 2 days. 

My management does their best to hire people. I see them bringing in people to Interviews constantly, but the turnover is awful. It seems like the only ones who want to stay are the ones who’ve been there for years already. I wanna try to stay there for at least a year just to prove to myself that I can commit to a job for that long, but I desperately want to have more personal time. Would it be a good idea to try to find a part time/online job?

Anyway, we are quite understaffed at the moment. I take three days off for appointments. Longest time I’ve taken since my most recent medical leave.

So this lady I’ve been working with here for a long time always makes passive aggressive comments about my part time status even though I’m usually scheduled five days a week. Today was the worst.

Me: yeah I’m here a lot. I do what I can

Her: no you’re not. You were off the whole week!

These shiny, ""Nobody wants to work!"" signs

showcase four important features of the
bourgeois:

1. Their love of the free market vanishes as
soon as basic market forces like supply and
demand tip to benefit workers, even briefly.
""Competition breeds innovation,’ until they
have to offer competitive wages.

2. When the going gets tough, they roll up
their sleeves and blame somebody else for
their failure. When they hop on facebook to
complain about nobody taking personal
responsibility anymore.

3. Despite self-mythologizing constantly, they
have no work ethics at all. They'd rather close
the doors than lip the burghers themselves.

i literally only just finished my second day, and i already, forgive me for being blunt, would rather die. im not going to do anything harmful to myself dont worry, just feeling generally miserable.

i mean first off, im already beginning to feel the dread i used to feel about school, which is why i dropped out, about having to spend years, and years more of my time over and over doing what others want for no good reason. stuff i dont care about because i ""have to""...

all so im allowed to live.

but also, we arent allowed to sit. and for a 6 hour or less work day, we only get one 15 minute break, which feels more like 2 minutes of watching my phone so i know what time to go back, because it passes by so fast anyway.

and if im honest? i wouldnt feel half as bad if i was allowed to sit. all i do is stuff shit in bags, why do i need to stand? what, so i look professional? so the customers...i cant even fathom actually why it matters? literally who cares. 

everyone so far has told me that ill get used to it after a few days! maybe itll begin to hurt less! maybe better shoes would help! (i fuckin doubt it, unless youre able to cast a magic spell on a pair of shoes for me)

i hate that. i hate that im supposed to get used to pain. im 99.99% sure im fucking mentally ill, im already used to pain! mental fucking torture! i spent a whole year of my life thinking id be better off dead and it was so horrible i cant even put it into words! (but it also made me so determined to get better, and i have, gladly) im literally so used to it that i barely complain about it anymore or talk to anyone about it even though i kinda want to cause it fucking hurts! but physical pain is something else entirely. ive been laying in bed for an hour and a half and my feet are still in pain.

call me weak for it, i dont care. maybe i am. at least im not willing to put myself through this much pain for a 50$ work day. 

the people there seem cool at least. i do wish the best for them. also some dude came up to the checkout with like 50 of the same microwave dinner and it was pretty funny and i genuinely hope that dude enjoys his dinners, it was something else

im supposed to go in tomorrow for another 5 hours but honestly.... highly considering just skipping it. my family is gonna be mad at me and itll make me halfway to getting fired but i just... its not worth it. i cant do this to myself. i wish there was beginner jobs where i could just sit all day and like type or write or even draw, im good at those things man, not this.

The depth of the Great Depression. I was down to my last nickel. I invested that nickel in an apple. I spent the entire day polishing the apple and, at the end of the day, I sold the apple for ten cents. The next morning, I invested those ten cents in two apples. I spent the entire day polishing them and sold them at 5 pm for 20 cents. I continued this system for a month, by the end of which I'd accumulated a fortune of $1.37.

3247,I think I wanna stop working.,"So a couple weeks back I made a rather cringey post about a dude I work with and me feeling like
He’s slowly becoming a drone. I deleted the post cause the first reply I got was kind of rude. And I kind of regretted saying as much as I did. But anyways after that post things with the guy improved a bit so I convinced myself  that maybe I just was imagining it. I even talked to some people who were mutual friends (or acquaintances with him) and like they didn’t think that was happening .  But I saw it and I pretty much heard it today, this older manager was like “you gotta stop being a young adult and be an adult”  (which I think in the right context is perhaps a good sentiment) but in this particular context it was like encouraging him to cut ties with his friends.  And stop saying or doing “immature, rebellious things”
And like stop being lenient with people
He was in charge of . 

Which all in all it’s the just broader idea of all that that bothered me, and I was like “I don’t wanna become like him, and I don’t wanna see him become
That” 

And we’ll idk it got me thinking more on how just even the nice moments feel so dulled because I work now, and like even the nice stuff at work they don’t feel so nice, like every nice thing said to me feels like manipulation at work. Even if maybe it isn’t (at least not always) 

And I realized that I’m in school right now for computer science which is a great field, and like right now I’m
Working a shitty low end job (with some great people)  (or well maybe I even deluded myself into thinking they were great) but idk I realized working got me in this stuck mindset and I started performing poor in college.  And becoming more like the people I worked with and like work was becoming more of my life than my time off was.  Like it got so bad to s point where to some degree I crave work like I’ll just think about work or people at work on my days off. And I’d be chastising myself for my lack of work ethic or ducking up something or saying the wrong thing or whatever. 

And Idk I think maybe I should still stick with college but like  I realized that even if I bounce back from college and get my degree I’d still just be working a job where I’m im
Following someone else’s orders and being undermined (maybe to a lesser extent or in less shitty way or for different reasons) but it’d probably happen and even if it doesn’t that workforce mindset will continue to take hold
Of me
And I don’t want it (read that like Jon snow from
Season 8 of GoT (sorry humor) but anyways I feel like my individuality has been stifled a bit, and I worry that I’ll never gain what I lost back. 

This was a long ass post but just how do I become person who doesn’t work. Or at least a person who doesn’t work for a corporation.

I am a business Major working for the fed as an intern(not the fed a small company connected to the fed). I can say I am well versed in the economy globally and historically as the concepts of it.

I came across the subreddit looking to read up on outside sources of inflation. I think this Subreddit is a joke.

You guys can be communist I don't have a problem with it (along with as I'm not in the system), but even communists know you have to WORK, I mean I do have to learn about marxism because that is economics but I don't think he specifies on not working that absurd and just idiotic on many plains of logic and reality.

I Just don't get it how can you guys just think not working in general can work? please explain the logic

Even Marxist societies knew you have to work it natural to the universe from atoms to superclusters

Yes, I know USSR, China, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea arent communist in practice but in practice, you still have to work.

I am not a leftist I see the fault lines in the structure one major fault line of the econ left is thinking not working is sustainable like wah?

I'm just so confused about who will keep the sewers running, who will build the government welfare building who will repair it, who will service it, and who will supply those companies.

First, off if you think printing money works, it does work but not for the poor it literally ripes the poor apart, look that the covid relief most of the money went to Blackrock bank while Biden and trump piss on you with 600$. Inflation is good for debt, the government is 24 trillion dollars in debt they rather devalue the dollar 4x so they can just pay 6 trillion in **value.** that's another talk. 

explain this

* who will innovate other than for bare necessities like straw shoes and primitive devices?
* who will work to keep social order?
* who will Legislate for a larger community like a country

Acting Assistant Secretary
Bureau of Legislative Affairs
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street, of

Dear Is. Durakoglu:

He write on behalf of Or. Wars Godson, the Executive Director of the Clock Island
Chamber of Commerce in New Horsham, Rhode Island.

Is the enclosed letter indicates, Or. Godson has questions regarding the State Department’s
plans to begin isa processing for the J-1 BridgeUSA program. Businesses on Clock Island rely
heavily on the tourism and travel industries in the summer season and have seen firsthand the value
that J-1 isa holders working on the island bring to the local economy. Is you know, COVID-19
has also hit the tourism and travel industries particularly hard, and they are especially eager to
prepare to safely welcome tourist in the coming season.

Presidential Proclamation 10052, which temporarily suspended the entry of J-1
nonimmigrants, expired on March 31, 2021. However, Or. Godson reports that U.S. embassies and
consulted continue to deny vistas or refuse to schedule J-1 applicant interviews. He is concerned
about applicant’ ability to travel to the United States in time for the summer season, and he
supports the resumption of interviews for J-1 isa applicant.

He ask that the State Department start processing J-1 isa applications as soon as possible
and allocate sufficient resources to ensure that J-1 applicant have their applications reviewed in a
timely manner. He ask you to consider expecting and prioritizing isa processing to help J-1 isa
applicant get to the United States for the summer season.

He would appreciate any information that you can provide on this matter, within all
applicable rules and regulations. Thank you in advance for your attention to this issue, and we look
forward to your response.

Sincerely,

is in.

Does management HAVE to be authoritative, “mean”, show their power? If u acted like that in a school group project trying to be the leader no one is going to be motivated.

Isn’t being kind and motivating ppl, being understanding better? Ofc I don’t mean letting ppl take advantage of ur kindness or stepping on u though. I just don’t see why bosses have to be “not nice”. If somebody is clearly incompetent you can still approach it in the morally correct way.",False,n82lr5,artofbeingunbothered,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n82lr5/innocent_newbie_askingdo_bosses_have_to_be_a/,3,1
3277,It's not about the money it's about doing a good job.,"Was talking to my boss today. Told him I don't make the girl who works for minimum wage do too much when she works with me on shifts together. And I just leave her to do the easy things while I do the heavy lifting and get the hard stuff done.  
I make far more then she does. And he says I shouldn't do that and minimum wage employees should work just as hard as the higher paid employees because it's all about doing a ""good job"" not about what you get paid. She's not gonna get a raise. She's just a filler part time employee. So I don't see why she even has to do any of the things I do.

Double standards and favouritism.. when some people can freely work from home when I was told off for asking to work from home when I feel a little bit unwell. Company culture.. they don't want to make a difference between office and store people. While they don't pay overtime for the office people I would think there should be at least some privileges for them.. like working from home (yes, I told that some people have the privilege but it's because they suck up to the bosses, it should be equal for everyone)

I literally don't think it has anything to do with reason or logic, right or wrong, I literally think that the economic propaganda and peer pressure to take part in servitude is way too strong for any normal brain to avoid. 

I've just learned to accept that we live in a world of basically monkey's. You should never, ever expect good or smart from them. Most of them think pieces of paper have value. I'm sorry but that less intelligent than many animals at least in one way. I guess my point is that I'm never ever going to try to do the right thing anymore because it's kicking sand at the waves. Humans are not a good alien species. They're one that has to be told not to go to war with itself. If you really think a species of monkey's that have computers and still can't figure out that servitude is a bad thing, are ever going to actually successfully create a system that is fair and just, you're kidding yourself.

And the guy I used to work with (who had the same shift as the guy above)...would roll in 15-20 min late.  ""Sorry I'm late, I had to stop at Sonic.""  No mother fucker, you WANTED to stop at Sonic even though you were running fucking behind, but you didn't respect me enough to tell yourself ""While I would like to get some fast food, I'm running too late to do that and get to work on time so I'm gonna have to skip it this morning.""

I leave early to work so that I have time to stop and get something to eat on the way in.  If I don't have the time, you know what I do?  I don't fucking eat for 8 god damn hours so that I can be there on time.”

Unwell on Tuesday but still logged on to work. Worse on Wednesday so called and said I wouldn’t be at work. Wanted a thorough explanation of what was wrong which I gave. Got told to maybe have a rest and if I feel better to start work later. Fair enough but still, piss off.

Sent a message on Thursday as I couldn’t be arsed to speak to anyone and got a reply asking if I should see a doctor to maybe help and is there anything I can take to make myself feel better quicker! Like wtf i’ve been ill for two days I haven’t lost an arm and yes of course I am attempting to make myself well again. 

Sent a message today saying I was awaiting a doctors call as I decided myself I may need some medication and I will be off again. 

Received a message asking if I can log on as they are desperate and arrange the call during work time. Ignored it. Then got called but missed it as I put my phone on do not disturb. Then received another message asking if I could call. THEN another asking if i’d be on today at some point as they really needed it.

3328,Something interesting to think about.,"Something I found interesting to think about is if you have any family that lives away from you in a city a few hours away or in general just isn't that far from you but still enough to take some time to prepare a visit.

Let's say you visit these important family in your life twice every year, and let's say they're 65 and will live to an average of 85 to 90 years. That means you're only going to this family only 40 to 60 times before they pass away, is that number okay for you? And what's preventing you from visiting them? Is it work? Is it time taken up from work? Is it stresses of missing days due to work? Is it because you're only able to see them on your days off from work? Are you okay only seeing them this little amount of times?

And I'm too tired afterwards to do anything. 

I moved down to part time to work on my side business- seo writing. Dream job... no anxiety about the commute, I can work from my couch with my nice heating pad...

I have a long term client but the most they can give me is 5 articles a week. Which is enough to pay the bills, but not to thrive. 

So... one more client. One more long term client and I'm done with retail forever. 

It's still work, but it doesn't feel like work to me. I love research. I love writing. It's amazing. All the articles I've written have been praised, even if it wasn't long term and was a one off article. I'm so unbelievably excited.

If a person is actually so far gone that they're willing to put pieces of paper before humans, run. The sad thing is that this will be the majority of people, but in my experience it's always best to avoid them. If a humans actually thinks that paper has value, their intelligence isn't much higher than a handicapped person, and it is possible that they could be dangerous in my experience. 

Figuring out that pieces of paper aren't worth giving up your life for isn't exactly a tough thing to figure out, so if you're facing someone who hasn't even gotten to that point, I think its fair to assume and expect about the same in terms of morality as a monkey. They might understand right from wrong to some degree, when it affects them, but not when it affects people outside of themselves, similar to an animal. I'd go as far as to say this animal like ability to be so self centered and unintelligent is the sole reason we as a species are still under system of servitude disguised as system of freedom. 

All you have to do to trick a human into thinking it's free is call the system is under free. Reality has literally nothing to do with it. Words don't even have definitions to most humans actually.

3343,Boss keeps using “you wanted to come back here!” as a point in his arguments. (rant),"Ranting on this sub and listening to others rants is fucking therapeutic.

I “wanted” to come back here because the workplace was actually half decent last time I was here, but now you’ve seemingly had a shitty change in management during my leave.

I “wanted” to come back because I found multiple reasons to live, one being my girlfriend.

I “wanted” to come back because you need money to do anything in this godforsaken world.

Me coming back to your place does not mean that I see you as a fucking god, or that I actually care about staying here. If your conditions get too fucking shitty I’ll just quit and find somewhere else.

I wonder how my fucking boss would react if I let him know the real reason I quit last year was because I was prepping for my suicide attempt because of terrible work-life balance. And the months before that, I was researching my method and buying the materials for it on company time. Afterwards I spent my presumed last days on earth discovering the Persona series, and I played P5R twice and 100%ed it, then called it a night and started taking the meds and the chemical. Decided I’d play P5D while waiting for the time I had to wait in between the pills. 

Honestly, I never went to a hospital for physical or mental reasons. The physical recovery was terrible, my kidneys felt fucked (I really don’t know what word better describes it) and I couldn’t walk without pain and weakness for about 3 weeks, but it got better and eventually faded completely. The mental recovery was a lot faster, and I’m fine nowadays. All my frustrations stem from work, and now that I know that it’s easy to deal with.

I just remember a distinct feeling of serenity before my suicide attempt though, I had quit my job and was doing whatever the hell I wanted before the planned day. It was nice. Sometimes I wish my attempt worked so I would be out of the 9-5 hellstorm, but if that happened I never would have met my girlfriend.",False,n6yoaf,Fetrospec,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n6yoaf/boss_keeps_using_you_wanted_to_come_back_here_as/,0,1

They had me scheduled from 5pm-10pm one day, then 7am-12pm the very next day, these are my only hours for the whole week... 10 hours... when I was promised a minimum of 30.

Obviously I protest this to the manager reminding her I was promised 30 hours at least. I keep getting told that these are the only hours available.... blah blah blah.

Now, I am not discounting the effort or idea of bettering yourself. But there are literally millions of shitty paying jobs in the US.

So yes, YOU might be able to get a degree, YOU might be able to land a six figure job. However not everyone can. Someone is still going to have to work at McDonald's, Walmart, etc and still be POOR. 

All this does is ignore the ROOT CAUSE of the issue. 

Imaging having to wake up every day and crawl through a giant web of venomous spiders. Obviously this sucks ass, but you ask someone how to get to deal with them. Instead they simply say ""it is your fault you have a giant web of venomous spiders"". 

That is all this sub offers. It completely ignores the ***cause*** of poverty, it only offers solutions on how to escape it. 

But not everyone can afford to buy a flame thrower and finally get rid of that nasty web of spiders. 

By blaming people for poverty, you aren't helping. Poverty is not always a person's own actions. You can be wealthy and your wife gets cancer and you have to sell your house and drain all your savings to afford the treatments. There is so much shit that goes on that people aren't always prepared for. 

This brainwashes the poor into believing they are just a lifetime of hard work from being a millionaire. So then they too start blaming themselves and each other for their condition. A condition that is simply a byproduct of this shitty capitalistic bullshit and often not their own wrong choices or mistakes.

Saying ""you are to blame for being poor"" is propaganda. It diverts the attention of what is causing the poverty.

3369,Back at work in the office,"This may end up being long and I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. After over a year of getting to work from home, we got told to come back into the office two weeks ago. They gave us two days notice and that was it.

 I've hated my job for a long time, I'm approaching 3 years as an administrative assistant at a computer networking company. The constant pressure, unrealistic expectations, mainly manual processes and toxic work culture is becoming unbearable. I thought I was miserable before, but now it's even worse that we're back at the office. 

I got used to being with my boyfriend and dog, and being able to go for walks during the day. I was able to get up and throw laundry in, or do the dishes, or prep for dinner. Now all of that has been taken away, and it has completely destroyed my mental health. I have an hour commute total, which makes me not want to do anything when I get home. The house is a mess, my laundry is everywhere, and I'm so drained from the anxiety of being at the office that I've been coming home and sitting on the couch and doing nothing else for days

I've been trying to quit for awhile, but unfortunately employers will only hire you (the ones that will pay me enough to support myself anyway) if you have years of experience in the exact position they're looking for. And this is the only relevant work experience besides customer service that I have, so it's hard to get a job doing something else. So surprise surprise that I'm having trouble leaving, my position is very niche if my skills have to already exactly match what an employer is looking for. It's ridiculous, i could easily learn any administrative position with my experience, but no employer wants to hear that. 

I'm going back to school to work in healthcare because I can't work in an office like this any more. It's truly soul sucking. Everyone acts like what we do is life or death and that everyone's lives need to revolve around this shitty company, and I just don't understand it. It's selling computer equipment, get a grip. I can't even take it seriously anymore. 

The unfortunate thing is I'll be starting from scratch. Once i get all my certifications i still won't be making enough to support myself fully for years because i don't have the work experience for it. Luckily I have a partner who can afford rent on his own so it's a less serious situation than other people have, but it's still messed up

I don't know where I was going with this and maybe it's just a long rant, but it's no wonder everyone is anxious and depressed of this is the shit we're all dealing with",False,n71q7q,thathotmom24,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n71q7q/back_at_work_in_the_office/,14,1

3373,"I can't do it anymore, I just can't","I am using my throwaway as most of my family  follow my main  account.

I'm 19 and I started my job at McDonald's  during March. I actually  didn't get a choice in whether  I wanted to or not, I was forced to by my grandparents  because  they threatened  to kick me out if I didn't get one ""soon"", so my uncle hooked me up with a job part time with them so it wouldn't  effect  school.

Sounds  good right?  No.


At first it was fine, a little  pocket job where I could have some cash in the back and still do my schoolwork. But when I started having leg pain from standing  constantly  everyday 6-11(12 on some nights) and everyone shrugged  it off it began worrying me.

I'd talk with them about all the countless times I almost  slipped in there and they'd  be worried but wouldn't  push futher. I tried to address it to my co-workers and  manager but all they did was mop and even after then it was all oily and slippery  within a few minutes  again.

It's  gotten worse, I try to be as happy as I can when dealing with Rude and angry customers  but it's  gotten to a point where when we told a customer  we closed  early, he took several pictures  of me and just kept his phone honed  on me.

3377,I don't know if I'll be alive next year because I don't want to sell my soul.,"Right now I'm able to live relatively freely since I get government assistance because I'm in my last year of Uni. This gives me the freedom to spend my time doing what I actually enjoy like reading, meditating, [making music](https://open.spotify.com/album/3KyHX3SwPjbcAK2TOfzfVJ) and just doing nothing in general. I don't have a lot of money but I have enough just to get by and that's enough for me because I prefer being free over having money, which leads to the main point of this post. At the end of the year I'll be done with my course and the government assistance will stop which basically means that If I'm lucky I will get a job in the field that I'm studying (Counselling and Youthwork) which is preferable to any other job (to me), but unfortunately it is still work. If I'm unlucky I will have to get a shitty job that I will be doing purely for the money because I have no real interest in any other jobs, but I refuse to do this. So because I refuse  work a job I don't care for just so I can keep living (which mostly consists of work), when I run out of money I'm going stop eating and drinking which will eventually lead to my death, and I'm okay with this because I genuinely would rather be dead than waste my life doing things I don't care for just to make money. That's not life.

I've thought a lot about this and I think if I have to I will go through with it. I've even been fasting on and off for a while to get my body used to the lack of food. I've also spent my life avoiding working shitty jobs just so I can afford food and shelter, so if I end up in a situation where I *have* to work a shitty job to afford shelter, food and water, I'm just going to stop eating and drinking (I won't have much of a choice anyway) so I can check myself out of this shitty game society has created and forces us to play. I'm aware that this all probably sounds crazy but it's very real to me, and I will go through with it if I have to because freedom is everything to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *""I made a decision: Not to work. To live as a parasite. I never worked in my life. I never had a job, except for a year, in Brasov, as a high school teacher. And it was a complete failure. I realized I could not practice a profession. I have to wander around in life. To avoid any responsibility. I have to do everything in order to save my freedom. Freedom to not work in the proper sense of the world. All my life, I calculated how I can be free in a complete sense. Life is only worth living if you are free.

Walls for ending extra

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling on
Congress to cancel the extra $300 in weekly
unemployment benefits, biting worker
shortage.

""The disappointing jobs report makes it
clear that paying people not to work is
happening what should be a stronger jobs
market,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief
Policy Officer Veil Bradley said in

on Friday. ""One step
policymakers should take now is ending the
$300 weekly supplemented unemployment
benefit. Based on the Chamber’s analysis,
the $300 benefit results in approximately
one in four recipients taking home more in

unemployment than they earned working.""

The U.S. economy added much fewer jobs
than expected in April, with employers
increasing their patrols by 266,000 jobs,
well below the 1 million that economists

expected. according to consensus data

3391,I am so sick of this shit!,"I hate my job! and I hate the daily cycle. Start work at 8:00 a.m, I have about 50 emails when I logon, multiple meetings during day, junior staff making  mistakes and asking stupid questions, one staff member disrespecting me most of the time.  I didn't even ask for this job. I was happy in the old role I had until my boss decided to  have a child and told me I am getting a ""promotion"". I want my old position back!!!!!!!! I was paid less but atleast I didn't have to stress about managing other people and their fucking issues! No, it is not my job to arrange for your childcare on the day that you need to come into work. Figure it out. You are an adult so stop whining about the fact that you actually need to manage shit in your life. 

I am a middle manager in a medium sized company. It is a start up that is just going into a scale up company so we don't have any processes or procedures in place. Most of the time I am just making shit up on the spot. Oh a customer wants to return product?? Well we don't do that.... why dont we do that? ... well because I don't think it is a good idea! 

My manger has been on maternity for the last 6 months and did not plan for coverage. She wants to  feel involved so I often have to reach out to her with questions. when I do reach out it takes a while to get a response. I am consistently working 10-12 hour days just to keep up with work and most of the time I am falling behind. The only way I can manage this is because we are working from home and I am saving time not going into the office. I just hate everything about this place! I have no decision making authority as a middle manager but all the responsibility. Some days I feel like a glorified messenger! They want to have the fluidity and flexibility of a start up but  behave as if  we  are  a large company with processes ( when we actually don't). I would like to take a break!!!  I have vacation days available but don't want to them because my work cant be delegated and I would just need to work overtime when I am back to catch up. Fuck this !

It stands to reason therefore that the ultimate goal of an employee should be to do the least work for the most amount of money possible, whilst avoiding being fired or layed off.

3420,I’m granting myself my own time off of work,"When I worked in retail, after a super busy holiday season one of my older coworkers non-chalantly went up to our boss and told her that she wants to take 1 month off to visit her family in Florida....anddd that’s exactly what she did, she came back after a month, was put back on the schedule and kept her job without our manager scrutinizing her over taking that much needed month off to be with her family. Obviously our manager wouldn’t have gone up to her like “hey you’ve worked hard, why don’t you take a month off?” but she took her precious time and energy into her own hands and knew she needed a break from work.

That moment made me realize that I really wanted to take life into my own hands and I don’t want to sit around waiting for my employer to grant me 1 week off of work out of the entire year to do whatever I want to do with my life. So I’m planning a one week trip to wherever the hell I wanna go in the world or even just to volunteer and feel good about giving back to others.

How? My family lives all over the east coast. How am I supposed to see my family?

So I get 2 weeks off. I need this time to relax. But no. I'm expected to go on a Dumb n Dumber style road trip and drive all over the southeast corner (the prostate) of this country. Using time that is supposed to help me recover from being a slave, and instead wear myself out physically and emotionally dealing with family.

3430,I'm thinking of quitting my current job to heal my depression and anxiety. How do I get the most out of the time I am not at work?,"I am currently employed as a software developer. Unfortunately, while I can tolerate it at first, I developed depression and anxiety.

It has come to the point that I was thinking of dark thoughts so I am currently taking medication to help myself heal but I feel like I have to get a complete rest from work for several months in order to fully recover, so I am thinking of quitting.

While I rest for several months, I am thinking of giving myself the attention I should have given myself but failed to because of depression or being too busy with work. For example

* travelling to places
* finally fixing my health issues (body weight, blood pressure, hygiene)
* Exercise (because I totally lack it)
* socializing with people (making friends)
* making myself look good and fashionable
* enjoying nature / video games, etc.
* Learning art, music composition,
* Playing music instruments like guitar
* Others

Of course, I can't live without working at all, so after several months of recovery, I'll be looking for work again, hopefully more tolerable than my current, but that's for another topic.

What other things can I do to maximize the recovery or improve myself (both mental and physical) during the period I am not working?

I will be happy to get any suggestions.

3431,Traffic Control Flaggers are expected not to pee. For 10 hours.,"So working as a flagger pays 30% over minimum wage here to start. The only catch is that you are expected to literally never use the (non-existent) washroom, ever, your entire shift.

I should have compassion (dude, it's here somewhere) because it's sad when people identify with a shitty job so much that they feel the need to shit-test you with their indoctrination-y crap.

3447,Blockchain the key to less work?,"So much hype in the crypto world right now with Dogecoin all over the meme world, and bitcoin and ethereum getting mainstream coverage. But if you look deeper at blockchain as a technology, and the advancement it represents toward personal agency, privacy, and transparency I think there are a lot of points that align with what I consider less work or anti work. This isn’t necessarily an original take on the subject, but a few areas where there is alignment are below:

1) Integrity of Network and Distribution of Power: Currently all monetary transactions have to go through some sort of central database that clears a transaction. There is usually a fee to do so, and if there’s not as they say “if you’re not paying for it your the product”. Blockchain enables you to transact directly with another person, no middle man, no fee, anonymously, so no data leak etc. Part of Anti-work is cutting out the government and corporations wherever possible. They aren’t incentivized to improve our working environments, because there is no monetary reason for them to do so. This represents a place where they can be cut out.

2) Security: cryptography is a must, there is no opting out. This affords confidentiality and anonymity in a transparent and authentic way. Blockchain is public, so there is no hiding malfeasance, and therefore no social incentive to harm. This includes institutions. What’s yours is yours. Anti-work to me means cutting out the flab and excess. I sign a contract to perform whatever job, and you pay me what we agreed to. The rest is code.

3) Privacy: For similar reasons to above your data should be private to you. My job doesn’t need to know all the details of my life to determine whether or not I’m fit for a job. They certainly don’t need to know my age, gender, and skin color. The black box of your personal identity can be owned by you in blockchain, and it should ring true that you are only required to share what actually qualifies you for that job.

4) Ownership Rights: Music, art, media,  copyright etc. Blockchain acts as a public registry of everything confidentially. Artists can make the money they deserve without a middle man, and the rights to that work come with it, this is the concept of the NFT. Many people on this sub appear to be artists, or the like, this allows you to transfer ownership via smart contracts.

5) Inclusion: This creates a system of distributed capitalism where people are not left out. There are too many barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and even owning a bank account in some parts of the country. Even as money has moved online the fees associated with transacting using apps etc. keeps people out. You can interact on blockchain with no drivers license or birth certificate, documents required to participate and are difficult or impossible to obtain in some areas.

I think blockchain is the future and on top of everything I’ve just listed above it favors automation and less work.

If this interests you, I recommend you read Blockchain Revolution by Tapscott. I’ve summarized their ideas above, but they’re eloquence is more attractive than mine.

3450,Why I don't feel bad for businesses that can't find work,"We've all heard about the worker shortage on the news and how business owners can't find work, but what about the other perspective?

Before Covid, I made about 11/hr working at a restaurant. I would be your typical service industry worker in America, young and in college. I didn't receive any benefits, and rarely took days off. The working conditions were pretty bad and I sustained a decent amount of injuries from burns or heavy lifitng. As someone who had been told growing up that service industry jobs were easy jobs for losers that anyone could do, it wasn't really reality. The jobs I worked weren't difficult skill-wise but they put a major toll on my body and would tire me out by the time I got home. I feel like white-collar workers don't realize how difficult and energy-consuming regular restaurant work can be at times. 

Once UI started, I stayed on it and started looking at improving other skills so I could make more money in a different industry. 

I don't feel bad for the bosses because they never really did anything to improve our condition. No one of my co-workers ever made over $15, even our cooks. The busboys and waiters would share the small number of tips they received which often would amount to under $11/hr which was less than what I was making (I was a dishwasher). And forget leisure time at work, as we rarely got breaks and our boomer bosses would ride us whenever we were on our cellphone. 

I know a lot of restaurant owners, and they look down on their employees. I remember some boomer restaurant owners calling most of their workers ""losers"" who can't get a real job because they'd rather smoke weed all day.

Now with the pandemic, those workers don't have to go into those soul-sucking jobs that disvalue them every day. The same bosses that used to degrade us and force us to work in terrible conditions, now can't find workers. My friends have told me that the working conditions during the pandemic have been terrible and many workers quit. It doesn't help that the types that go out to eat during the pandemic and usually the rude and entitled types of customers. 

The business owners ought to look within and stop blaming UI. While some might decide to stop working, it's emblematic of a larger problem that the industry is facing. When you pay low wages, offer substandard working conditions and no benefits people will not want to work for you. Already, I'm planning on transitioning into food delivery which pays more and I don't have any bosses controlling my time and body. After UI, they will still struggle to find work, because they haven't addressed any of the problems in the industry. Maybe business owners should meet their workers in the middle for once instead of crying for the government to give them more help. And hopefully, they will start to realize how important their workers are to the success of their business",False,n70nhf,brokecollegkidd,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n70nhf/why_i_dont_feel_bad_for_businesses_that_cant_find/,5,1

A chartered accountant/ engineer with intermediate experience for $400 a month. And that too they can be made to work in the office for 13 hour days with no consequences.

3452,To the outside I look like a failure but really I refuse to work in unsafe conditions,"I quit a lot of jobs because I value my health. To everyone around me they just think I ""quit when things get hard."" I mean yes, I am not perfect, but the real reason I quit is because if something doesn't check out logically from a health perspective, then fuck you. End of story.

Unfortunately that's like every fucking job? 

Worked in a cabinet factory - the air is toxic and it's intensely fucking loud. 

Worked climbing cell towers - (omg I freaking love climbing SO much, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it) but it's unsafe as fuuuuuck. Engineers? Never heard of her! Also cell phone monopolies would rather their workers literally die than shut down the tower during repairs. And (shock, horror...) lose cell service in order to, oh I don't know, not expose people to the highest possible EMF. Just silly things like that. You can't see EMF so, it's okay!

Worked commercial shrimping - tried to rehabilitate herring that had got caught in the bottom dragging net as by catch. Their swim bladders break because they are caught in the net and depressurized from the ascent. I'm literally crying right now. And the stereotype of most (esp white) fishers being disgustingly sexist has some weight behind it. Nothing like a 60 year old man who has a daughter the same age as you on some stupid fucking power trip. Oh and you get to destroy the Earth: bonus! Sexism AND ecocide. Faves.

Worked at a spa during the pandemic - quit because: pandemic. Like seriously what the fuck? I needed money but I'm not trying to die. They had steam rooms open. Hot tubs. Saunas. Nothing like cramming 20 people, recently flown into a tourist town, into a hot steamy room to share each others viruses with each other :) what joy. Of course I'M the bad guy and the paranoid one lol. Ok. No you're right - wearing masks in the hot tub will solve everything. And yes! I should be the only one wearing super extra ""PPE"" because I'm so ""concerned"" about it. Mhmm. Makes sense. 

Carpentry - I'm good at that. I wish I could just enjoy being good at something. But if you saw through wood all day (and I mean like literally being on a chop saw all day) you saw through all kinds of treated with formaldehyde and shit pressboards so you get to breathe that in all day. I wore a respirator, which is a ""paranoid"" move, but really it's a ""hey look the air is full of tiny chemical particles move."" Oh and there's wildfires raging beside us, but we're building fucking condos instead of caring about the forest burning. Because we need money to live. 

Electrician - I quit because the union is in bed with the government, obviously, and perpetrating genocide by building a massive hydro dam. I'm not here for it. They care more about money than reality. And they loooooove green washing LNG. 

Dude every job. Every job is FUCKED. And that's not even 1% of what other people in the world are going through. It's just that I've always considered myself such a failure for not sticking with things. Well why the fuck would you stick with something like that? Makes no sense. So if anyone out there struggles with the same thing, like yeah I know we all need to take personal responsibility for our actions, but I for one know that you're not crazy. :) Maybe you're too legit to quit what's really important to you instead. We're not crazy for creating change even if it starts super small, or for being different from a lot of people who have been temporarily lulled into complacency. We're all complacent in our own ways anyway. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!

Suddenly it makes sense why there are so many people suffering with diseases. Do most people work? Yeah. It's work related disease for the most part. That and eating chemical laden foods. Poisoned water. From.... ""work"". Fun times. No one is crazy for being against that. I know I'm not alone in feeling like a failure. We all just need to stop feeling like failures. And don't even think of blaming yourself for not figuring everything out and being perfect sooner! No one is perfect.",False,n70w29,uisge_beithir,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n70w29/to_the_outside_i_look_like_a_failure_but_really_i/,12,1
3453,"Ever since I entered the work force, I have had 162 jobs.","No joke. 162 jobs total. For ten years (and to this day) my anxiety was so fucking bad that I would start a job, do it for a week (two or three if I was really lucky) and quit because I simply couldn't handle the stress and the pressure. I never considered myself to be disabled in any capacity, just that the environment of a job was so overstimulating to me - everyone so fake, so critical of everything that I did, almost waiting for me to make an error and then when I finally did, blatantly making fun of me to my face and outcasting me from the group socially. This was and still is my living hell for ten years.

The environment of a job for some people, no matter what kind of job it is, is bullshit. Being forced to interact with fake ass people who want nothing but to see you fail is so fascinating to me, because over the years I could also tell that most of them hated working and we're as miserable as I was. 

It is said so many times on this sub, but it's a truth that must be reiterated - humanity is not designed to work in and will never thrive in a capitalist economy. We are doomed to a miserable life of wage slavery in America. I hate to get on here and just vent, but to those who have any sort of anxiety disorder who are being thrusted into this fuck ass job marketplace because they have no choice, and suffer everyday from it, just know that you're not the only one. Knowing that doesn't change shit, but it's true nonetheless.

This is why people become alcoholics, get addicted to drugs, develop any sort of self-destructive behaviors and in many cases eventually end up killing themselves. It's because they are left option less and can't live in a lie anymore.

My question is why do employers like doing this kind of shit? If we have one system that already works and shows you everything you need to know, why make another system that does pretty much the same thing, but complicates everything? 

Every goddamn time I start a job everything goes so smoothly up until the point where upper management just wants to add a bunch of nonsense bs rules and expectations and then wonder why no one wants to fucking work.

3490,The most toxic job interview ive ever had. And i said can i sleep a night on it? Im not gonna take the job they can shove it in their toxic ass.,"So it all started off with the agency company thats the normal way to find a job. (Working with an agency company, they can fire you in a eyeblink they get money to let you work.) they offer €8,40 an hour for 20 year olds. Picking orders/deliver them for the grocery store. Then the woman from the grocery store texted we cant have the interview today im not fit. Mkay so today the agency company called we have a diff function instead of delivering only order picking. Cuz you dont need the 2nd interview to order pick. The woman “that was not fit” was actually on vacation... then the best part were only gonna offer you 75% salary the first week due you not knowing what to do. The hours are 4 hours a day. And not even always 5 days a week. Estimated €36,50 a day.

3494,If youre going to force me to be here at least let me be myself and have fun as long as no one gets hurt and productivity is met,"Got told this at yearly review. Jobs hate listing good things and ususally use one thing to justify not giving you your full raise. I lead a crew. We get everything done in record time I make sure of it and we have fun. I dont mean horseplay but I make sure everything is done done safely and everyone learns. We laugh and joke around though because I believe work should be fun. I also think bitching at work is funny and keeps people laughing. I got my review and why I get the most work done and have the happiest crew and make sure all apprentices are learning they chose to ignore that and deny me my full raise because I'm in their words I "" joke around too much am lazy and could be doing more with company time"" my "" anti work and joking are not becoming of a foreman and other workers are complaining."" Probably because they wish they were on my floor having fun and getting things done ahead of schedule. You would think management would see how my crew has fun has the best attitude and is finishing work in 6 hrs that usually takes 8-9 and ask me how I can improve all moral for everyone. Nope they see a lazy slacker who dicks around and could be helping other floors catch up instead of writing up other journeyman/ foreman for breaking peoples wills to the point they can only work at 75percent pace. I fucking hate work culture and cant wait until I can bankroll a crew of people who hate work but make the best of it like myself theres a reason construction workers are all pissed off and drunks its because you break their spirit by taking away their individuality and ability to have safe good wholesome fun on the job while learning and building.",False,n5pthx,stonerplumber,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n5pthx/if_youre_going_to_force_me_to_be_here_at_least/,3,1

As most of you, I have a job that I hate. I admit it's a good paying one in the tech industry and I do like my craft, programming, but I abhor the work I have to do every day. It's a bullshit job but it pays the bills and every day is getting me closer to retiring early.

I do my best to be productive and just work my eight hours a day and go on with my life (this job IS NOT my life) but I don't really get into shirker territory, although that's a position that I respect in certain scenarios  (as described in [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mrxipp/why\_i\_am\_a\_shirker/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/mrxipp/why_i_am_a_shirker/)).

Last week I had to attend one of those wasteful ""brainstorming"" meetings, I work remotely but it's all the same stupidity, and the owners of the business mentioned they were not happy about my being a nine-to-fiver, that it looked like I didn't care about the company.

They just don't care about all the work I've done for them; they just care about complete obedience and that's something I'll never concede.

To hell with this company and these people; if they don't like that I work just eight hours a day, which is already too many, then instead of babbling and wasting time in meetings all day they should learn how to program and do everything themselves. Damn leeches.

Of course I didn't answer to the provocation, just responded with sweet words and a smile and will continue doing my work at my pace.

I'm so looking forward to the day I can just leave. I won't say anything bad to anybody; these idiots don't even deserve my rage so just knowing that they will be fucked without me doing everything for them will be my reward.",False,n5lpc1,mentakatz,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n5lpc1/the_donothing_employers_called_me_a_ninetofiver/,9,1

What example is that setting by not calling a potential/current employee on time. LOL. am I crazy? And then I vent to my wife and she says ""well, why don't you call them? If you want it that bad."" OK. I have 7+ years of sales experience on my resume and my for lunch with the territory manager and regional sales director. They know I want this. Yet they won't call me when they say they will, and they still haven't (2.5 days and counting). They told me I was impressive and even called me ""bro"" in a text. Yet my potential partner won't call me when they say they would. Solid communication example. LOL. Maybe I'm expecting too much but it's not hard to respect other's time and peace of mind.

3538,What are you planning on doing to get out of the system? What do you actually want out of life?,"Homelessness?

Van life?

FIRE?

Me and my girlfriend are planning on just living in a van. We don’t want much. We don’t want these sports cars that so many people are running each other over in a corporate ladder to obtain. We don’t want high rise apartments or $50,000 bottles of wine.

We just want time with each other. Time to enjoy nature. Time to enjoy each other. We don’t want to waste away our lives in a dreary diarrhea shit tornado called a “job”. We may have to if our savings and investments aren’t enough, but we’re never putting ourselves through this 9-5 shit again. Frugal living and part time jobs if anything.

This has been said many times but look at the big picture. You’re on this earth for a limited amount of time. You spend most of it doing dreary work 8+ hours a week and that’s time you never get back. Nobody lies on their death bed wishing they worked more. Most will wish they worked less. Maybe some of you had an opportunity to get into a job you love. That’s great. Maybe your job actually has meaning to it too. That’s also great. 

But for a lot of us, we’re stuck here sending emails, filling out paperwork, washing cars, flipping burgers, just doing all these things that we don’t care about. There’s no meaning to it for us. It makes us feel empty. We lose all sense of control of our lives because we have to do this for our higher ups, we have to do that for our higher ups. We have to do their bidding at all times. We have to show up to a strict schedule and if we argue against it or question it we get metaphorically crucified.

At the end of the day, look at what’s making you truly unhappy. Is it actually your job? Is it actually your wife? Think on it for days, weeks, months if you need to, but however long it takes, make sure you do what makes you truly happy and gives your life meaning. If you wanna go live off grid, fuck jobs, go live off grid. If you truly feel that you’re unhappy in a relationship, calmly discuss it with your partner, but again, whatever you do, carefully consider your choices.

For me, I don’t want to do these “jobs”. I want to direct reward work - I want to hunt, fish, etc. but I don’t want to do today’s version of work where you do someone else’s bidding to then barely be able to get the means to receive your reward. I just want to live a simple, free life. I think this society is complete garbage, and I’m not obligated to contribute to it just because my mother decided to pop me out of her body. That’s just my opinion and my view. Yours may be different, and that’s fine.

I’m just here to try to open some eyes. Life doesn’t have to be completely bleak. A lot of other people out there are also opting for van life. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Life is too short to subject ourselves to things that make us unhappy. If it isn’t working for you, just cut it out of your life, even if that means cutting back. Sometimes, giving yourself less can give you more in the long run.",False,n5ja4n,Fetrospec,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n5ja4n/what_are_you_planning_on_doing_to_get_out_of_the/,24,1

Time feels like it’s passing so fast, but at the same time feels like infinite agony. Just over 3 weeks ago I was going insane because of a recent increase in workload from one of my bosses. It feels like it’s been forever.

Idk man. I think work and the idea of work has gotten to the point where I’m being sent into delirium or some sort of psychosis-related issue, no matter how much I’ve learned to not care. It’s because at my core I don’t want to be shackled down and forced to do someone else’s bidding, I just want to be a free spirit, but I know I’m going to be stuck in this for a few more years before I’m fully prepared and informed for van life.

3560,"Like all of you, I'm tired of being told how valuable and essential I am while working for less than living wages.","For context, I am a direct support worker in Pennsylvania. I could stop there, but I want to explain my gripe. 

In the field of direct support, you work with clients who at best live in clean homes and have a family to help them care for themselves. This is rare. Most of the time, you get clients who don't even want to see you, and at worst can be very aggressive towards you and live in homes that would not be deemed livable by any standard. I have been hit in the face on three different occasions in the last two years, with one ruining my glasses and cutting my face. The doctor said one centimeter lower and it would have been my eye. I have gotten bed bugs from clients, I have been put at risk of getting COVID from clients. 

It is exhausting to go to team meetings and trainings and constantly hear how important you are in the life of those you support. In medical trainings they tell you that you could be the difference between life or death for someone so you have to know the signs of any life-threatening disorder they may have. At regulations trainings, you are told all of the ways that you could screw up and be fired, fined, or face jail time if you commit fraud, even accidentally. Even if it was your boss who fucked up and blamed it on you or changed your regulated notes to fit their goals and get them out of trouble. They have access to your notes at all times and can ""whitewash"" (a common term for changing visit documentation to show no wrongdoing) them at any time.

Then, when you receive training for the job, you get to hear about all of the great changes and impacts that you're making in the lives of others. A common inflated lie told to convince you that you want to be there. You are told how you are the most important person who can help them connect with their community, how you are important for helping them lead better and more fulfilling lives because ""All they need is a little help and someone who cares"". I'm tired. I'm just really really tired of hearing these lies. 

Base pay for a DSP is $7.25 in PA. This is minimum wage. The cap on earnable wages for a DSP is $15. For 3 years I have been a team lead and responsible for over 20 other DSPs and I just last year made it to the $15 mark, but only if I agreed to be salary and now I work well over 50 hours per week. My work offers no benefits because my boss ""Wants to let the employees decide what to do with their money"". He is proud that he starts workers at $10/hr because other companies in the area start you lower. He has not been able to pay us twice in this last year because the company has no money, but he just bought a house for himself and his family.

I reported him to the department of labor and they said they couldn't do anything because he had promised to pay us before our next pay date. The system is broken.

3571,It took putting in my two weeks for everything to get better,"This has happened at past jobs too, but the moment I put in my two weeks notice everything at my job got better. My managers are nicer, my workload is manageable, which means I'm doing some of my best work in a long time, I got taken off of multiple unnecessary meetings, and teammates I've barely spoken to in months (our company Slack is silent most of the time) suddenly are reaching out to say hi and give well wishes. 

I'm leaving this job for a lot of reasons (burnout and bad management are just the two biggies), but in the final stretch I'm having the thought: ""if it was like this even close to most of the time, I wouldn't be leaving at all."" 

Anyone else have similar experiences? Seems like this is part of the dance of corporate culture - burn hard until you burn out, then once you're no longer their problem managers can afford to be better.",False,n68wcs,wickedly_santa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n68wcs/it_took_putting_in_my_two_weeks_for_everything_to/,8,1

3573,"Fun Question, Do you Hammock Sleep Indoors? I sold my bed and found deep satisfaction.","Really curious, are there are others that see the bed as a consumerist mechanism?

Apologies for any feeling offended, I would not normally suggest removing an essential comfort item in your life. I ask as I saved a remarkable amount of money by only sleeping in a hammock. I also have now realized a list of benefits you could enjoy should you see the cultural conditioning of beds as optional.

1: Beds in contrast to Hammocks increase material costs to your personal comfort thus generating more demand costs for comfort on an often unconscious necessary component to a safe and stable life.

2: Both my wife and I use hammocks for 6 years now full time with many friends using a similar sleeping arrangement from sheer practical value.

3: I now own no sheets, comforters, and linens in, in general, are unnecessary. Instead, I own a quality lined sleeping bag that I've never needed to replace while being easy to wash and travel with. A small travel pillow is all I need now.

4: No bed frame to clean around or under with hooks mounted on my walls 13ft apart we sleep in parallel low enough to the ground to simply step over my partner in the middle of the night for a bathroom run.

5: When hammocks are not hanging you have nearly an empty room to enjoy various activities as yoga is a favoured one but it can also leave room for a desk or more storage if needed too.

6: I'm tall 6'5"" and my work is tough on my back for 3 years before this we had assumed I was doing something wrong or some chronic movement was damaging and inflaming my back. I was so wrong I should have eaten a boot for just how incorrect I was. After the first week of finding my hang (not groove as per the normal colloquial). All my back pain went away. No drugs, no Chiropractor, no special stretch, just gone. In the coming weeks where I push myself or do something stupid like lifting a 120lb box on uneven ground and do truly pull a muscle I lay down and the pain is consistently 10% of the previous evening.

7: NSFW The intercourse is the absolute best by a significant margin with hammocks.

Now looking back and understanding minimalism with my entire lifestyle this square in billions of rooms around the globe is nothing more than another consumerist good meant to waste your effort acquiring. I say stop aiming for one and go get a cloth fabric. Here in Canada a company imports hand made hammocks from South America sourced from smaller communities in need of the income and the originator of many of the designs and weaves they use locally. For 80$ cad, I have never made a more comfortable choice of relaxing.",False,n5t0ri,Pimm314,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n5t0ri/fun_question_do_you_hammock_sleep_indoors_i_sold/,26,1

3585,I love getting these bullshit articles in my news feed.,"Take a look:

[https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/want-to-raise-successful-kids-jeff-bezos-says-practice-this-1-simple-habit.html?utm\_source=pocket-newtab](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/want-to-raise-successful-kids-jeff-bezos-says-practice-this-1-simple-habit.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

So billionaire Bezos says to practice this ""simple trick"".

&gt; But, in this case, the advice that Bezos gives ***aligns almost exactly with*** [***the research of Carol*** ](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/want-to-raise-successful-kids-science-says-praise-them-like-this-most-parents-do.html)[***Dweck***](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/want-to-raise-successful-kids-science-says-praise-them-like-this-most-parents-do.html)***, a psychology professor at Stanford University.***  

Oh, so Bezos didn't come up with this on his own, did he? Shocking..

Here is what Bezos had to say:

 

&gt;Take pride in your choices, not your gifts. ... This is something  that's super-important for young people to understand, and for parents  to preach to young people. It's really easy for a talented young person  to take pride in their gifts: ""I'm really athletic,"" or ""I'm really  smart,"" or ""I'm really good at math.""  
 That's fine. You should celebrate your gifts. You should be happy. **But you can't be proud of them ... What you** ***can*** **be proud of is your choices.**  
 How did you decide to use your gifts? Did you study hard? Did you  work hard? Did you practice? The people who excel combine gifts and hard  work, and the hard work part is a choice. You get to decide that. And  that is something that when you're looking back on your life, you will  be very proud of.  
 

Wait what? I can't be proud of being the worlds greatest guitar player, I have to produce 20 top-selling albums and then I can be proud?

&gt;**The people who excel combine gifts and hard  work**

Hmm, last I checked I didn't know of any a-list actors living in a dumpster, or someone who can run the world's fastest mile working at Burger King.

I can't be proud of my gifts? I have to be a slave? What the fuck kind of nonsense is this?

3586,I have no idea what my parents do for a living,"Both my parents lived the American dream: They were born in the 50s to blue collar parents, they were the first of their families to go to college, and they graduated and got corporate jobs and provided a great life for me growing up.

But I could never exactly understand what it was they did for a living. When I was a kid I asked my mom what she did and she gave me a 10 minute long explanation. My dad's response was a couple sentences, but it still didn't make sense. I had gone to their jobs several times, and all I remember them doing was spending an hour or so giving me a tour and meeting everyone, showing me how to play games on their computers, and then making phone calls every once in a while.

Turns out they worked in sales and marketing. I also worked in sales and marketing later on. I still have no idea what those departments entail.

Meanwhile I have family who are less well off who you know exactly what they do. One is a construction worker, he builds stuff. One is a nurse, she helps sick people. One is a teacher, she teaches stuff to kids. Yet they're all struggling and my parents made great lives for themselves doing work no one understands.

Here's a level up for the Boomer haters: Neither of my parents' degrees were in business. They went to school for liberal arts and just lucked into business jobs as soon as they graduated and were able to buy a house 4 years later.",False,n5hcv4,Nickzreg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n5hcv4/i_have_no_idea_what_my_parents_do_for_a_living/,11,1

3588,I just have no motivation by Thursday,"I'm exhausted. I don't even dislike my job that much, but by the end of the week I am usually beat. It's the kind of thing where my boss says ""I don't micromanage"", but really all that means is that he gives blanket statements and expects you to understand. We get 15 minutes a day to talk him, I was lucky this week he scheduled a meeting with a couple of us to talk about a project but he spent more than half the time on the phone with others and responding on teams. So now he gave us this project without any of the necessary tools to actually work on the project. Without going into too much detail, we don't have fundamental programs on our computer but are expected to use syntax we have never used or been trained on to solve the problem. I know that a boss can't plan every step of the way, but it feels like most projects are like this. Told to accomplish a task with no real knowledge or understanding of the circumstance.



This pretty much envokes too moods from me, intense anxiety when I can't solve something and not giving a fuck once I settle down and start thinking the problem is bigger than me. There's a nice middle ground every once every 1-2 weeks where I feel like I know what's expected of me and it logically makes sense. But other than that, just not feeling great. I also have to interact with higher management and that always worries me, although much more of a minor issue. I don't make crazy money but I make enough (~38k annual). Idk I feel like the stuff that is expected of me with no training is just a bit too much. My boss always acts like he's open to listening but like I said, impossible to actually ever talk to him.



I kind of just want to quit and say fuck it, but I know I can't really do that at this moment. Also feel like all IT jobs are going to be like this, kind of working in every department just trying to figure shit out. Looking for a way out seems like a daunting task but maybe needs some thought.

Colleague asked me if I was excited to start work again. To which I answered ""No, not really.""

Just the look on their face was telling, almost disgusted that I wasn't in some state of euphoria to be doing something for 8 hours a day to get some pay.

3610,I just remembered something (suicidal related),"This isn’t particularly work related, but I remember when I looked for help after an experimental attempted suicided.

So I went to my community college psychological help office and had a meeting with this guy. I explained my entire situation and my attempted suicide. 

I was pretty fucked up because of the death of my mother and also a cheating/manipulative/pathological lying boyfriend. To much on him to add to this story.

But what stuck with me after telling him this is his response was “I’ll set you up with a psychiatrist and will get you the help you need to get back to your schooling.” 

When he said that, I just thought to myself. Like, are you fucking kidding me? Like the most important thing right now is my schoolwork? 

I just wanted to fucking end it. Im sure the last thing I fucking care about is my studies. I wanted to fucking die.

I remember when working at Amazon they offer psychological help as well. I was pretty depressed and felt suicidal working for that bitch Bezos as well. 

I thought about going but to me it was fucking pointless. Why would I go get counseling from a job that makes me feel this way? 

“Ok, let’s fix you up so I can just break your ass down again.”

How fucken awful.

3611,I've never been able to hold a job for more than a year,"I don't know how I'll be able to survive in modern America.  I feel like I'm screwed.  Every job I've ever had I've quit after roughly 6 months.  I just feel like I can't survive the soul-crushing pressure to have a routine of working 8+ hours per day; my personal care falls to the wayside and I break down and quit every time. 

For reference, I am a law school graduate, which is a long-term commitment and takes a lot of work, and still each job I've gotten I feel like just wasn't for me.  I don't know how other people do it.  I feel like each opportunity I've had, I've been lucky to get and been successful at doing, but at the end of the day I can't deal with the daily work routine and pressure.  My mental health deteriorates over time at each job and I flee for self preservation.  When I'm working, I can't ever focus solely on myself and my personal care falls to the wayside.  I've had panic attacks, I've outlashed, and gotten to the point of suicide ideation. 

I'm just rambling now. I want to look into doing seasonal or feelance work, such as writing or short-term contracts.  I think that would fit my needs.  But to all of you out there who stay in shitty positions for extended periods of time - I am actually envious of your reserve and props to you.

They're just shell corporations for what the US actually exports.  What does the US export?  Guns and ""democracy"" (business contracts) and they import natural resources that are often just straight up stolen from the third world, and use slave labor for manufacturing.

3639,How I’ve dealt with a job putting off promised raises for two years.,"First of all, throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So, I work for a local business and started in May of 2019. The initial help wanted ad I applied to promised 13$ starting wage, I got the interview and was offered the job but for 10$. When I asked about the 13$ the owner told me (and this should have been a red flag) he lost most his staff and was hiring a bunch of people at once, and after 90 days when he figured out what roles people would fall into he’d be giving raises based on that as well as additional raises every year of employment.

Well I didn’t get that 90 day raise till about 150 days, and it still didn’t put me to 13$ but hey, I like the work so I figured I’d stick around and see what a year brought since I consistently took on new tasks and did extra work &amp; was raised to believe bosses would notice that sort of thing (lol) 

Year one comes to a close and oh no, we’re holding off raises for a bit because Covid just hit and the business is iffy, I shouldn’t have accepted this excuse but I did, but with the caveat that I would be working one less day a week and a shorter schedule (4 days a week, 28-30 hours) My two year is in about two weeks and I’ve still not gotten that first year raise even though I handle shipping and see business is 100% good enough. They’ve consistently asked when I could work full time again, every time I’ve said “just as soon as we talk about those multiple raises” and I don’t hear it again for weeks. It’s a battle of wills, I want money and they want my labor but unfortunately for them I value my free time more than any cash amount. 

As much as the low wages suck, it’s honestly real nice to have so much free time to enjoy my hobbies and have time with my daughter. And my overhead in bills is covered by freelancer web dev work. I’m sure one day they’ll put their foot down and demand I go back to full time, and in return they’ll get a two hour notice.

I've was barely scraping $700 a month before finding a second job.

My second job, a contract teaching position, pays $15 an hour, but I don't get 15 hours a week even. While the workplace environment is better, and I have more room to experiment and more money to use for materials, I don't have enough hours. 

I'm good at what I do. I'm an art teacher for both of my jobs, but I can also woodwork, fabricate, and enjoy going the extra mile for my students. I've asked for raises and been denied, and looked for better jobs but $15 is where it caps around here.

3665,The story of me bailing in the middle job interview,"Just a little context, I already have a well paying job that I enjoy, and in my off time I do a lot of mountain biking. I noticed one day that my city employs trail stewards, spoke to one of them and it seemed like a pretty decent way to earn some cash on the side, they do essentially the same thing I already do for fun, with some extra digital paperwork for reporting things like trail maintenance. It’s part time and at the time I also lived walking distance from the largest trail in the city, so I figured I might as well get paid if all they want me to do outside my routine is carry a phone and occasionally open an app to fill out a form.

Fast forward to the interview, I’m immediately amused that the person interviewing looks like she has never seen a day of exercise in her life much less ride a bike, but I suppose that doesn’t really matter. Here’s where they started losing me: 1) I’m not allowed to pick what trail I’m assigned to, ok, not the biggest deal in the world, I enjoy and am familiar with all the trails they patrol. 2) I have to attend a training class on how to use their iPhone app, again, not a big deal, at the time I was working for Apple and found it funny. 3) I have to attend a bike safety class that includes intentionally falling, tucking, and rolling off a bike…ok, not that crazy, I’ve fallen off my bike plenty of times without seeing it coming 4) I have to have 4 days of open availability but I only get 12 hours scheduled and you don’t get to set preferences…that’s when I have up trying to rationalize it and just said “Alright, I don’t think we have to talk about this anymore, you guys take it easy” and walked out.

I just don’t understand who that is meant for? It’s clearly not meant to be someone’s side gig unless they are working another part time job that allows for only 3 days of availability, then it’s 12 hours?! I kinda wonder what would happen if someone gets legit hurt during the safety course because they likely don’t have health coverage anywhere else at that point. I deduced that it’s meant for retirees or the most desperate people in the world. Now when I see trail stewards out there I ask if anything has changed for the better over the last 5 years, and naturally it hasn’t. I feel bad for each one of them.

3678,I feel like I'm reaching my breaking point,"I'm being robbed.
Not just wages, that's a given, and I've accepted that this is my lot in life until I can save up enough to get away from here.

But time as well, which equals life and experiences. I am spending the best years of my youth working for 10.00 an hour in a stressful job in a local supermarket deli.

I also work in another department in the store. So I'm working near full time hours with no benefits because they'll cut just enough hours to put it right under 40 hours.

Funny how that works, but still feels like 40 hours 5 days a week. On top of that our department is severely mismanaged and understaffed. We've lost 3 people and have taken on all their workload.

We get chewed out when we don't finish our production list because we have to spend all day waiting on customers. We can barely keep up our service case too as people keep coming and taking stuff faster than we can fill it back up. 

I've literally stopped caring at this point. 
People want custom cut deli shit when we can barely even keep up our production. It's time consuming, and annoying, Karen, when you want your bologna sliced extra thick and there are 5 other people waiting behind you and our other staff is busy waiting on people as well. 

Not to mention all these boomers come in literally every 2 days since shopping is pretty much their only hobby. Maybe if you bought more than a half or quarter pound of lunch meat you wouldn't have to come in every 2 days. Some people I see EVERY day. I just don't get it.

Our deli is huge by the way, at least compared to a large corporation deli like Walmart; about 3x the size for our lunch meat case alone. And we only have about 3 or 4 people at any given moment.

It's just infuriating to get called out for not doing our jobs when the circumstances are literally preventing us from doing it. I have to wait on customers. Or they'll throw a shitfit. If that means we don't finish our prepackaged product then deal with it. Don't get mad at us when you can't schedule nearly enough manpower to handle our customer load.

I got asked to stay later to 9pm when I'm scheduled to work at 6am the next day. I'm thinking of just walking out because I'm literally under no obligation to stay longer than originally scheduled.

3698,I actually really like working in a corporate environment,"Because of how fake everything is. The jobs. The culture. A lot of the companies' goals.

Most of the day consists of lying to make it seem like you actually did something or passing the blame if something went wrong. It sucks if the blame is passed in your direction, but then you can pass it on to someone else if you're lucky.

I actually got my most prestigious job by lying. I lied on my resume, my portfolio, and in my job interview. I got to the job and really had no idea what I was doing, but I pretended I did and actually got some on-the-job learning experience that set me up down the line for other jobs (On that note, I'm pretty sure I blew a job opportunity recently because I was truthful. I had a little bit of experience in the position they needed, when I should've said it was a piece of cake and just learned on the job through doing it or examining other people).

The other thing is that no one actually knows what anyone else in the company does for a job. In my case I was a designer, so my job was one where I had to create a product and have something physical for people to see as the result of my labor. But no one knew what my job entailed (""That computer stuff looks so hard, I could never do that!""), so I could easily say a project would take 4 hours and then knock it out in 30 minutes. 

On my end, I had no idea what anyone did. Most people just seemed to write emails, avoid phone calls, and attend meetings where nothing of note was accomplished. They all had job titles, but it was just a jumble of words that formed a sentence but had no real world meaning. It's also kind of interesting that these types of jobs pay more but entail the least amount of work.

And the sad truth is a lot of employees don't even know what their companies do. They're just a group of people inside a building that does a set of tasks and somehow money comes in and they get paid. This is especially true if a company doesn't specifically produce a product.

In the end, working in a corporate environment becomes like a game to see how much you can bullshit and still succeed.

At some point in the middle of the twentieth century, maybe when the shareholder value myth developed or later when private equity exploded, there was a culture shift where managers ""decided"" to push white collar workers past the brink of maximum productivity and in to burnout. Few workers could keep up and the rest were discarded. 

Now, in 2021, it feels like that push had reached some limit. Basically, if you feel like the work you are doing now in your field is more difficult and more time consuming than the work done by someone similarly situated a generation or two generations ago- you are probably right. 

I think we have all reached our limit. I think we have reached the terminal. If managers want more productivity or profits I don't know where it's going to come from.

3740,Need to get a job this summer and I am not looking forward to it.,"As a student, I live on scholarships and such for 9 months of the year. This summer, I won't have enough money to do all the things I want to do, so I need a job. I've been looking at dumb part-time entry level jobs.

Holy crap. I am not looking forward to this. Just reading the ""careers"" pages of these companies is sickening. Here's a quote from Target's career page:

&gt;The experiences we create at our more than 1,900 stores and how we get our guests the products they’re looking for are the heart of our business. Opportunities abound, whether you love brightening someone’s day by helping them in stores or getting what they want delivered to their door.

Look at that fake-ass PR recruiting language. We all know the deal. I do labor for you, you pay me a paltry wage. I hate that they try to sell us this bullshit wholesome image when we put in a *job application.* The reality is, they'll work us like dogs at every opportunity as long as they can get away with it, and if we complain they'll find someone else to fill our spot.

-----

And then there's all the games that employers are playing right now.

My friend got hired for a job last week where they told the manager **during the interview** that they couldn't work on a certain day. Surprise surprise, the first thing the job does is schedule my friend on the day that my friend cannot work. My friend calls them and says ""hey, I can't work this day, we talked about this"" and **immediately gets fired** with the job saying ""we need someone with more flexibility."" I'm convinced they were just trying to push the limits and see if my friend would bend over.

I've also heard McDonald's is essentially forcing people to accept job offers by taking their SSN and driver's license during the interview and reporting them to the unemployment office if they turn down a job offer. So they can hire everyone by default, and then just fire them whenever.

Like, I think that a lot of businesses are playing one or both of these games:

1. They know they can survive for months by overworking a small number of employees, so they're playing hardball. They know there is a large number of unemployed people, so they figure they can make demands and treat people like they're disposable even more than usual.

2. They're severely understaffed, so they're trying to manipulate or force people into jobs. They can make all kinds of verbal agreements, and then break those agreements. They can hire a ton of people, make it clear that their jobs are at will, and fire the ones that are difficult to manipulate.

I'm honestly wondering if we're witnessing the death of the service industry, too. In 2008, the recession caused a bunch of people to lose their jobs, and then *those jobs just disappeared.* Those people were never hired back. Companies realized they could just work the remaining employees harder and automate things to fill in the gaps.

What if this is the final death of human decency in the workplace? What if businesses use the COVID recession as their long-awaited opportunity to put the final nail in the coffin of workers' rights? Sure, they'll still need *some* employees and they still need to follow *some* laws, but they're already finding legal ways to do shady stuff.",False,n4vw9o,0resistance_OBEY,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n4vw9o/need_to_get_a_job_this_summer_and_i_am_not/,1,2

3742,I hate working my job.,"I'm 27 male and I currently work at a security job. I have been doing this job for 3 years at this point and I'm currently trying to find a new job where I am either working from home or self employed. The only reason why I have not quit this job is because I have 2 summer vacations I want to do. One is in June and the other is in late August. I don't want to quit this job and get another job because I worry if I get another job too soon I won't be able to go on my vacations. 


Another aspect of my job I really hate is overtime. Most people would tell me ""But that is making more money. I would take all the OT I could get."" I am not that desperate for money and I just want to do my regular 6 1/2 or 5 1/2 hour shift and go home and be done. However I have a hard time telling my boss no because my boss was my former roommate. He knows if I ask call off I would just go home and watch TV and play video games after work. I basically got this job because I was roommates with him for a couple of years. 

I really want a work from home job. While it may not be fully not working. At least I'm closer to being independent, don't have to worry about my boss showing up and catching me on my phone, I can do a full work day without worrying about being asked to do OT, I don't have to commute miles away from my house.",False,n4nh01,Advi0001,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n4nh01/i_hate_working_my_job/,3,1

3746,"Grieving the unexpected and unfair loss of a close friend and can't speak without crying? Whatever peasant, Call us, don't text us.","Yesterday, I found out that one of my best friends (along with her cousin who was her passenger) passed away in a tragic car accident caused by a speeding drunk driver. As you can probably imagine, I’m incredibly upset, especially as the pandemic had kept us apart in recent months and no only was I kept from seeing her for months, now I'll never see her again.

I called out of my part job today because I’m not in any state to work right now, especially as I am client facing. The moment someone had a small problem, I’d lose it because I’m grieving and “you expect me to care you have to wait another day to hear back? My best friend just died in a vehicular homicide, so if that’s the worst problem in your life, I’ll trade you, Karen”. 

I sent a short text message briefly explaining the situation and acknowledging that policy says to call, but I’m distressed and can’t speak without tears.

They are still annoyed I didn’t call.  

Fuck offffff. 

I explained clearly in my message that I was not able to speak because I am unable to do so without crying. I have anxiety, and that makes phone calls difficult for me in even the best of circumstances, but being forced to make a phone call in this situation would have led to me having a breakdown and hyperventilating on the phone. I don’t see why they feel entitled to me further traumatising myself by being forced to speak about the situation to them. They were given the information they needed, they saw it, I don’t see the problem other than “bUt pOLiCy”. 

I can barely talk to friends and family right now, but you expect me to call you? Ugh no. And don't say ""we are like a family here"". You're not my family. You're my employers.

3765,Letting my daughter enjoy her life.,"My daughter hates doing online school. She's 4 years old and I don't blame her. It's unnatural for children to sit in front of a screen for hours during the day and she hates it. One of her first assignments was to make a PowerPoint about herself. She's 4. She barely knows how to use the mouse. 

As a single mother, I'm living with my mom who lost her job due to covid, I decided to keep her home and opt into online learning to keep her safe and since I now have childcare (thanks mom!). I honestly didn't expect online school to be so aggressive. 

This pandemic has been brutal for me. I've been working the entire time (somehow I'm essential). Online school was putting a huge toll on my family. My daughter started resenting school, she would throw tantrums, cry, I hated waking her up early. I felt guilty that my mom was in the position of trying to force her to go online. I can't do much since I'm working full time. 

I basically had an epiphany. Turns out kindergarten isn't mandatory. So much of our children's lives have been turned upside down, and I hated that she was feeling so much stress in her own home. At the end of the day, I couldn't make her understand that the computer was ""real school"". I felt stupid making her sit in front of a screen, especially when limiting screen time is so important. Children aren't going to remember the details of the pandemic, but they're going to remember what their home life felt like. And I DON'T want my daughter to have to deal with this during a pandemic. Especially with how her future might look like, and how brutal and unnatural our working lives are, I decided to unenroll her. 

Other parents I work with have kids doing online school and are shocked when I tell them I unenrolled my daughter. Four year olds should enjoy their lives. My mom doesn't deserve the extra stress. And if she's going to have to work like crazy in the future (I'm working hard to make sure she has an easier life than me), then I'm gonna let her be a kid during a pandemic. 

I hope when she's older she'll look back on this time and although she's missing out on going to parks and movies and sleep overs, hopefully she remembers enjoying sleeping in, playing with her toys, pancakes on a weekday and snuggling on the couch instead of crying over school. 

Kids learn differently and my daughter is not the online learning type. When schools can safely reopen we'll work together to help her catch up.",False,n4z2t7,soyycratess,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n4z2t7/letting_my_daughter_enjoy_her_life/,29,1

3771,Just got back to work after a week off.,"Allow me to give you a bit of context:

Last week Monday, I was sent from the main building where I work to another building a mile or so away. Apparently they needed the help over there. Meanwhile, I'm here with a huge backlog of stuff to do with my primary job and I try to emphasize the importance of what I'm doing and why they should let me do it. But nah, they don't even acknowledge it. I'm just ordered to go over. Apparently I was supposed to be over at that other building for a week assembling orders for shipment. I was there for a few hours before I was just like, you know what, no. I told my boss hey, I'm using the rest of my vacation time to take the week off. Amazingly it got approved. Let me tell you, that was the absolute best week of my life. Like, you ever just chill and relax, walk to the grocery store for your meal for the day? Just run all your errands on foot because you have the time? It was bliss. Today I returned to work. Luckily today hasn't been particularly bad, just another day. But lemme tell you, I miss that week. I miss not having a care in the world. But anyways, I've applied for a different job where I work in the office which should hopefully be **far** less stressful that what I do now, coming in every day and wondering what fresh hell awaits me and if I'm going to be doing something *not* my regular job.

And honestly...I'm kinda thinking of just quitting if I don't get the position. It seems reckless, but I would love to just quit, take some money out of savings and life job-free for a year before coming back after things are, hopefully, back to normal and no more absolutely copious amounts of mandatory overtime. A year without work would be bliss, though I fear I might be unable to return to the workforce after it. Though maybe if I'm lucky, I can find something to do that'll make me cash during my time off, who knows.

3780,I am so over my job,"Dear Antiwork,

      I have PTSD and work is hard in general. I need to have set guidelines and schedule flexibility. I work in retail. 

     When i started, I took my position 5 years ago as a manager qs a favor to my favorite manager because they needed someone. My boss told me ""run your area like you would your own business"", so i did. My numbers were incredible, and my associates loved me, but I was slipping in and out of depressive episodes. My favorite manager had left and a new manager took her place.

    Immediately, the new manager made it clear she did not like me. She became more demanding in my duties, but provided no proof that these things were expected of me. The next three years were torture. I was told to come in 6 days a week during our busy season and was not allowed to take vacation. My associates (who made 11 cents less per hour than i did) were allowed 5 weeks of vacation in a row ( I was not in charge of scheduling). 
 

   I requested my wedding day off 4 months in advance (a single day not during our busy season) and was scheduled and told to ""just get it covered"". I couldn't, so i was forced to call out and worry about losing my job on my wedding day. 

     But the straw that is breaking the camels back is that I took a demotion to work on my mental health. I communicated this. I also knew that associates had more lenency in their vacation time, so I gladly took a full time position as an associate. 

     When the company went through some changes, I was told my position would stay the same. Then they told me I was the manager of my department again. They changed my position without informing me, or having me sign off (no pay raise either, and no dicussion). 

I am going insane. I went to legal advice to see if there is anything i could do and they told me to talk to hr (we don't have an onsite hr, it is all digital).

3786,I feel guilty for hating my job,"I've recently come to the realization that I hate my job. But, I kind of feel guilty about hating it because by ""normal"" measures it's a very good job. I get paid enough to afford food, water, shelter, and to fund some small hobbies/recreation. I have a boss that always gives me reasonable deadlines for my projects and leaves me to get my work done (doesn't micro-manage). I don't really ever have to do overtime. I have a flexible starting shift time. I'm not expected to respond to emails when I'm not on shift. I never get weekend/evening work calls asking for more. I get regular promotions with a path ahead of me that would allow me to make a very comfortable living. It's not a difficult job. And I get along well with coworkers. 

But it's soul-draining. 

Every hour of my day is filled doing tasks that mean nothing to me. Moving numbers from one spreadsheet to another one and back again. Shifting through stacks of paper to find answers to questions that I don't care about. Responding to never-ending emails about the emails we need to setup for the client-meeting next week regarding yesterday's spreadsheets. And did you have that Profit/Loss report for Client T.G. for me?

I look around me and I can't tell if I'm the only one who feels this way or if everyone else is just really good at hiding it.

I also feel guilty because I have a good thing going here, as far as jobs go. But I have passions I need to pursue. Writing, music, art, game development, documentary film-making. I feel like I don't have enough time/energy to do both but I don't want to give up financial security only to fail because I'm not good enough. To me, it feels like the height of privilege to not be grateful that I'm not struggling financially when so many are. But I would love to be able to support myself doing something that I don't just barely tolerate, but actually enjoy.

*Life* is unfair. People die. People get killed. But who was the devil fucker who decided “HRR DRRR LIFE IS UNFAIR SO THE SYSTEMS WE CREATE MUST BE UNFAIR”

Complete backwards thinking.

Why not make a system that’s actually great? Why not make a system that reminds us that even though life can be unfair, it’s still a great thing? Instead, we got... this.

I can’t do 10+ hours a day much longer. I can’t keep having days where I miss time with my girlfriend because I pass out after work.

I just can’t wait for our off grid days...

Why do we slave away our lives for hours a day that we’ll never get back doing things we absolutely loathe for unfair compensation? Life is short. We should be allowed to enjoy the things that matter.

3798,The boy who cried wolf,"The rhetoric where I live right now is that the reaction to covid and the subsequent unemployment stimulus has dried up the market for low skill labor. places that have been open since before I was born are making massive changes to cope with the lessened workforce. The ""now hiring"" signs have gone up more in the past year than the past 15~ years. (I realize that doesn't account for inflation, but I still think that's pretty damn significant. These places have been min wage with some pepper for my entire life and they suddenly spiked up to 11/12 an hour.) More than that, the now hiring signs actually represent an opening and not just a constant fishing expedition to ensure a backlog of candidates to fill a spot asap. With all that said, I honestly think these places are being genuine about being desperately understaffed. 

...But hold on. They've been saying they're understaffed for my entire life. That's been the go-to explanation for responsibility creep, unreasonable hours, dishonest expectations, and most of the bullshit that comes with any job. Cutting safety corners? short staffed. Not honoring breaks? short staffed. Skeleton crews have been the norm, and have stayed the norm despite god-knows how many people asking about jobs a day. I've heard that nearly daily from every job I've ever had, that we need more people but can't get them. And now that that's actually true, these same places that played these fucking games with us are crying whole ass tears that their permanent skeleton crew bluff got called and now they're on a desperation crew. 

Covid has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. I say that with a lot of bitterness because it took a deadly pandemic to force anyone to do the bare fucking minimal to help the people who have been struggling for as long as I've been on this earth.

the limited update is that I spent a ~~bit~~ lot more time turning the app into a functional/scalable software package with an actual interface that doesn't look like its from the 1990s. and then sold the software package to my company. I did want to keep ownership of the code but unfortunately, more integration needs to be built to manage user permissions and access to scripts for other departments, they would not agree to a deal where I kept ownership.

I have a question that the answer will probably only be useful for my next job but do drug tests happen right after the interview before you're actually employed? Or can a job do the test after your first week or something? I wanna get a dab pen because this job actually drives me insane but my parents will call the police if I test positive

Also are interviews like legally required and would my supervisor interview me next week when they are in or something? Probably not because my parents didn't tell me to be prepared for that but I'm just paranoid about everything is all

Let's face it, I am never going to afford a house.  So what is the point? My partner and I have decided to save for a van and live a nomad lifestyle instead of a house. 

Two days is not enough to recharge and fit in everything. I want more time, as opposed to more money. There is always room to get more money. Once time is gone, it's gone. I am tired of it.

I already can't wait, and feel lighter already. The five day workweek needs to go. It is outdated and is detrimental to everyone. I am extremely lucky to be in the position where I can drop a day. 

I have already been ribbed a few times about not being able to hack doing five days, but I don't care. It is worth it. I am no longer being a hero, it isn't worth it anymore.

3819,I had to work due to multiple reasons and I think it burnt me out,"Bit of a baclground: when I was 21,I quit university to work because I thought I love working in retail and that can be future for me. 6 years later, when I was 27, I returned to uni. Of course by that time I had an established life and expenses so I had to work during my studies. That meant night shifts. Right up until Corona hit, I had it together even if it was gruelling. Since Corona, it was tougher but I made do. Then some taxes related to the house I own and live in, and health issues of both of my dogs, I had to apply to another job.

Due to my limitations (no real skill or paper of skill aside from FLT driver, lots of courses during the day) and Corona, I could only get a Monday-Friday night shift in a warehouse. I've been running on determination and coffee fumes for a year and a half, and this job with university is too much.

Can't quit since I need the money, but staying here hurts my studies badly. And that's my main goal: get a degree, possibly a PhD as a mathematician and work as one.

&amp;#x200B;

I have mixed feelings for Jordan Peterson's message, on one hand, I found most of it useful, but on the other hand, I think that his views on UBI and how people would find no meaning in life if they didn't have to work is speaking from a privileged place of being in a career which he is passionate about, is good at, while earning way more than enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came across this video and was curious about what he has to say about toxic productivity, and even he agrees that 1.Working too hard isn't sustainable and 2.After 3 hours of writing, he's done and isn't productive anymore and [3.Play](https://3.Play) is an important part of personal development and health.  Heck, he even mentioned that a client of his got to ""have the cake and eat it"" by working less. The only question I have is ""Why aren't corporations so obsessed with productivity on board with this idea?""

&amp;#x200B;

While none of this is anything we don't already know and has been scientifically proven, it seems that corporations simply ignore the fact that working too much is not only unhealthy but counterproductive.

3840,Going on “vacation” is extremely depressing and pressured to have fun,"Whatever amount of time you get for “vacation” (whether PTO or not) , it’s extremely depressing that after all of that , you gotta go back to the slave rat race …

I feel like there’s no enjoying time off. I panicked during my PTO because I feel pressured to spend and “enjoy”. The idea that I’m going to have to wait a whole entire year to do this again is what is killing me . I’m so tired . I can’t even relax or sleep in because I feel like I should be working or “brainstorming” (Thank you toxic entrepreneur culture) .

You can’t hang out with friends because they are working long hours too . 

I just feel like I’m catching up on household chores and errands that I completely ignored because I am so tired . 

And before anyone jumps in and says “Atleast you get PTO” - I’ve had the same depressing/anxiety inducing sensation when I took one work day off for a “long” weekend when I worked retail jobs since I was 16 all the way up to 22. 8-12 hours on my feet, working in NYC where the rent is extremely high . 

I only make 20 an hour after getting a “comfy” office job but I walk away with only 27K per year. Imagine trying to find a place with that type of salary in NYC . 

I still live with my father (my mother passed away from brain cancer 3 months ago ) and I just feel like I’m losing my damn mind . WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? I’m going on a tangent but what was even worse about my PTO was my mother died between that one week and we had to take 17k out our ass as a collective to bury her . I didn’t even get to see her during my vacation because of COVID. She died in a nursing home and we were no exception to the rule. 

I feel so lost . I started a print shop business in my home out of passion but now I feel like now I have to use that as a supplement income to move out. 

I don’t know anymore. I’m so overwhelmed. My life could be worse but why is it a competition when we are all depressed and borderline / are suicidal? I’m done.",False,n4dmgj,misssarajones,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n4dmgj/going_on_vacation_is_extremely_depressing_and/,8,1

3845,My Gf expects me to stay at a bullshit job where i make $2 less than my last job,"This is really just a rant on how i don't understand people. 

so i'm 21 years of age, i currently live with my GF (21) in her parents home. Before i moved in to their home, i knew that it was mandatory to be on my job hunt. i knew that i needed to be working, i never just think not working is ever an okay thing to do. But the way our capitalist country is ran, the average working class are being taken advantage of and i oppose of the way they do things. 

i've had 4 jobs since i've been here (March 1st) 
(walgreens, Dollar General, a furniture place, and Dirt Cheap... yes.. dirt cheap. Walgreens was too much of a commute, let alone i don't have my own vehicle. Dollar General only paid $8 and hour which is so unacceptable. The furniture place was alright but my checks would never even reach 200 a week. also they didn't treat me with the same respect bc of my age so it was a challenge dealing with that itself. 

now, i've been working since 16, started 12 hr shifts at 17. i know how to work, i'm not lazy or anything like that. i do want to mention that i also accepted a job that is actually something i could see myself doing for a while. with that being said... today i went in for my closing shift at dirt cheap. got there, they had me so busy work for 2 whole hours walking around picking up after people, not even doing my ACTUAL job. i was fed up, for 8 an hour, it wasn't worth it. so i surely called my gf to pick me up. 

She does so, but then i explain to her that i really don't think imma stay there especially that i accepted a new job that pays more. She just goes silent and say how i always leave my jobs and she's not gonna tell me anything bc all i'm gonna do is get upset and this that and the 3rd. i explained to her that those jobs are not worth my time... nor am i making a good buck there. i explain to her that it's not worth it. 

i had intentions on working dirt cheap and the new job with the moving company because we gotta get it out here somehow you know... But yeah she just gives me attitude and says she's just never going to understand. 

she doesn't even work, she stays home all day and helps her mom but like she doesn't have to deal with these companies that don't give a EFF about the working class. 

it's just extremely frustrating and it's becoming a problem nearly every other day. it bothers me that she doesn't understand that i can't just settle with working  for $8 an hour, or continue working at a place where i basically am like a little slave boy. ( deadass, ive walked my bosses dog on the clock because he didn't want to go out in the heat himself... his dog. 

anyway i hope this was a good read for some at least, i would love to hear other thoughts. she's crazy for telling me settle with that. that's how they want us to be, i refuse to.",False,n54ef9,keyontjenn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n54ef9/my_gf_expects_me_to_stay_at_a_bullshit_job_where/,22,1

3851,“Nobody wants to work anymore”,"A restaurant manager who
forced a Black man to work
without pay owes him more
than $500,000 in restitution,
court rules

By Scottie Andrew, CNN

Updated 5:52 of EDT, On May 03, 2021

 

(CNN) — A South Carolina man who was forced to
work over 100 hours every week for years without
pay and subjected to verbal and physical abuse
was supposed to receive close to $273,000 in

restitution after his former manager pleaded guilty.

But that initial amount was too low, an appellate
court ruled in April. The man should have received
more than double that amount -- closer to
$546,000 -- from the manager to account for

federal labor laws, according to the ruling.

John Christopher Smith was forced to work at a
cafeteria in Conway without pay for years. His
manager, Hobby Edwards, pleaded guilty to forced
labor in 2018 and was sentenced to 10 years in
prison for his abuse of Smith, a Black man who

has intellectual disabilities.

3857,Why do people still care about the companies they work for?,"I am a software developer. Over the years I have worked to 7 different companies, from small start-ups to huge multi-national companies. For me, work is just a necessary evil that I have to do so that I don't starve to death. I don't care about the companies I am part of, really. I just do my work so that I don't get fired. Once I find a (higher paying) / (less work load) ratio job, I immediately jump ship to the next one. 

But over the years the large amount of people I have come across seem to \*really\* love their job and take things \*so\* seriously. They are ready to work unpaid overtime in a heartbeat even without being asked to, because they want to look like ""rock start"" developers. They are ready to backstab their colleagues in order to get a promotion. They so passionately participate in soul-crushing meaningless meetings about the company's values, company's vision and how we can become a better team for the good of our company. In every job that I was part of, we had these excruciatingly disgusting ""retrospectives"" where we discuss how our team did in the past 2 weeks and how we can improve ourselves in order to make more money for the company. I have seen people crying or break down in tears in some of them, because they had to explain in front of everyone why they didn't complete their tasks, while in all of those companies there is a 🤡 ""no blaming"" 🤡 culture. In most of those meetings I just sit silent, browsing reddit and thinking where humanity has come to. It all seems so surreal and 1984-esque. Instead of a big brother we have the ""company"" that we have to care for, love it with all our hearts and god forbid you think for a moment that ""it's just a job"".

3876,Guys I might quit tomorrow...,"\[Apologies for how long this is\]

My job used to be pretty good, but in the past year and a half it has gotten a lot worse. (Office monkey type stuff). First they switched my very good boss with a new boss who sucks. They switched their groups for no good reason, probably some higher up thought it was a good idea to make it look like they were ""doing something"", I don't know. They also do random re-orgs for no reason about once a year or two, but I digress.

With old boss, I had a good rapport, she was supportive, respectful of my time, and treated me like a valued, trusted employee. Well all that is gone.

Anyway so they have had my group working at home for over a year now due to covid. Occasionally we have to go into the office though. The telecommuting rules are draconian and we had to fill out and sign a huge long agreement, I think it ran to 28 pages of policies and stuff we had to fill out, including photos and/or floor plan of our work area and so forth. It also states that they can come surprise visit us to inspect our setup etc. Which I am super uncomfortable with, even if my place was tidy (spoiler: it is not). Anyway so during the year they have not done that, but they made us come in for a meeting the other week, and made us update and sign our telecommuting agreements again, and told us that they were definitely going to be visiting our homes now. First time with advance notice, and after that, no notice, just whenever they want to spring it on us. And no indication of how often this can happen.

So there is that. Which may be reason enough to quit, idk. I feel like it kind of is. But also the job has gotten worse itself - more bullshit, assigning me more work than I have time for, and recently having to train someone to answer customer emails who does not have good professional-level writing skills. Like how am I supposed to teach this person grammar rules at this point in her career? Oof, a recipe for badness. 

And then the schedule shenanigans, making me work some partial-staff holidays without advanced notice. In previous years they gave us the lists of people who have to work for each of them for the whole year, in advance. So you could, you know, plan your off time or get a coworker to switch holidays with you or work in  your place. I sent a request to my boss to find out this list for the rest of the year, and her response was basically. ""No. We're not going to give that to you."". Great.

And my motivation has just been gone for months now. I haven't been completing everything, being a bad worker, I know. I just took a week of vacation, and checked my email because I was worried the notice that they'd be inspecting my place would have been during the week I was off. I didn't see that, but my boss sent a meeting invite, for just me, on Tuesday that just says ""Discussion"" at HQ, without further elaboration or explanation. Great. So I figure written up at best, Performance Improvement Plan, or fired. So I'm thinking of just quitting tomorrow (Monday), to just get it over with, and not have a termination on my record.

There is another thing - recently I have been thinking of quitting anyway, and moving back to another state to be near my family. My mom is pretty old and she's having increasingly severe health issues, and she gave up driving several months ago, so I could help her with that. And I may just use that as my excuse with nothing further when I explain why I'm quitting. Seems a benign reason that they can't really argue with, but I don't know how they would react. I will see. I do have a significant financial cushion that would last until I could find another job, and I just could really use a big change in my life. I'm sick of this city and state, I've lived here half my life and my reasons for staying are ending (child moving out, friend moved away, etc). I've been at this job for over 13 years, and I am just so sick of the place.

At any rate, if I decide not to quit Monday and go to the meeting Tuesday in the office, I think I am gonna bring all of my work equipment and keep it in my car, in case I need to turn it in if I'm fired/quit. Or bring it on Monday if I tell my boss I'm quitting then.

Sorry this is so long, just want to explain how it is and some of the bullshit I have to deal with. I told friends / one of my doctors about the whole suprise home visit requirement thing, and my doc said ""that's illegal, they can't do that"", and I told him ""they made us sign the agreement saying they could, and they've been doing it to the customer service reps for years now"". My friends and family think it's unacceptable too. But anyway. Yeah. About to pull the ripcord maybe.

3879,There’s Never Enough Time,"I know I’m not breaking any new ground here, but I leave for work in about an hour after the weekend off, and I’m already dreading it even though nothing particularly bad happened. I used to like my job, and now I don’t so that’s definitely part of it, but I think I’d feel out of time regardless. 

I hate going to work 40 hours a week to make a rich man richer and likely make the world a worse place. I hate that because of the hours I keep, my wife and I are basically ships passing in the night except for weekends. 

My home needs cleaning and I need to take better care of my health, but I don’t want to do anything on my days off except recharge my batteries. 

I wonder often what my life would be like if I worked two days a week and were off five. I think my house wouldn’t be a mess because I could clean without feeling it’s cutting out of leisure time. I’d eat better because I’d plan to do so, and I’d exercise more. And I could spend time with the people I love. 

I’m fortunate in that I make enough money to take care of all my needs and about all the wants, but the bills would consume us if my wife or I missed a paycheck.

3885,The Job Search is Only Fueling The Flames.,"Had multiple jobs schedule interviews with me over the last few weeks. I always get told how ""impressive"" my resume is, how versatile my skillset is...etc. and yet, this is how my last few job offers have gone

-Interviewed for Assistant Manager, told during interview that position was already filled internally, but I can work for 4 bucks an hour less, for part time, 2 towns over. I asked why I was even brought in if the position was filled, was told ""well we were very impressed by your resume and wanted to meet face to face and work something out"". I walked out visibly frustrated. 

-Interviewed and hired for manager at a tanning salon, they call me to schedule my first day and.... they want me to do my training an hour away for 6 weeks, and training wage is 3 bucks an hour less, and is only 20 hours per week. I inform them that I simply cannot afford that commute for what amounted to almost 60% less pay than I was expecting, they say I have no other choice, and so I resigned. 

-Interviewed for Assistant Manager at a different business, interview went great and I was scheduled to start 2 days later. 
Training day starts and immediately derails. The Store Manager (not who I interviewed with) seems to be upset that I was hired at all, and attempted to get me to agree to being paid MINIMUM WAGE, while being classified as entry level, with the manager saying ""if you can prove you belong here, maybe I'll promote you"". 
Reported him to the person who interviewed me (Area Manager) and was told I would immediately be transfered to a different store for my original position, its been over 5 days unpaid and still nothing. 

-Applied and set interview for a tire store, wage and hours were right up my alley. Was told during interview that my position is not one they hire externally, but would put me on a training regiment for 6 months and then would be considered for the job, again, the training wages were minimum wage. 

-Applied for a job that said they were looking for ""Hospitality/Restaurant/Bartender experience"", but the job description didn't really explain at all what the job was, just reaffirmed what experience they wanted. Got a call to set up an interview and learned this was for a DOOR TO DOOR SALES POSITION FOR A SOLAR COMPANY. 

And then this mornings interview. 

-Once again applied for a managerial position, store seemed super eager to get me interviewed and on boarded fast, and the hiring manager seemed to really like me. I get to my second interview this morning and am waiting outside their office for almost 30 minutes waiting to be interviewed, only to be told ""Sorry, we filled this position over the weekend, and have no other openings right now""

All of this has cost me almost 200 bucks in transportation (Lyft, busses when lyft is too expensive), and endless hours of frustration.

I could do college, but at that time I really didn't know what to do with myself and my parents didn't wanna hear something about ""figuring myself out"" or something. So they pushed me to art theory school, which I quit, because I didn't see any point of studying it.

I had like 10 jobs for few months, almost everything some kind of service. Now I'm at another customer service job. And finally, they at least pay decently and I feel like person there. It's home office, so I can do whenever I want, as long as I call. 

But you know, for 8 hour long shift make 100 phone calls and 70 emails...it's just too much. People are screaming at you for absolute basic shit and after all that quality inspector will tell you, that you need to kiss customers asses, or you won't get full salary. 

Since I work here, I smoke weed all day ever, day to handle this. I'm proud of myself, because my husband lost his job because of covid, cat went sick and so on...we handled it well and now we have money to spend for things we wanted. 

But I'm always tired, always high. I'm mentally drained and I hate people, because daily there are at least 30, that are screaming at me for no reason (seniors angry that stores are closed).

We are planning with my husband to buy some fixer upper, or cheap land to build tinyhouse, to have building costs at minimum. We are planning to grow our food, have chicks for eggs and in some years maybe cow or two.

I just cannot be under someone, or doing my hobbies under money pressure. I want to live. Not in expensive car, or in expensive house. Just live normal love without being drained of all of those shitty jobs i did. Every single one of them drained me from different reasons. And this job, that is actually great in terms of employer, is the last drop.

I want to learn something new, I'm not dumb, I'm just lazy and officially crazy (lol, it rhymes). So maybe some day I will start earning something else than unemployment. But til that day - fuck work system. 

I tried really hard, but everytime it messed me up for a long time. I tried to be contributing person to society, i tried to be ""normal"", but I just don't want to spend my youth in some corporate answering for faults of someone else. I don't want to kiss bosses asses, or make jobs, that are making me physically ill (yeah, selling tickets on bus station for minimal wage and they were amazed, that I have third bronchitis in half year).

Job description

Demanding Entrepreneur Seeking LEAD INTAKE CALL SPECIALIST

I'm looking for a highly organized, detail-oriented individual to fulfill a unique set of needs. I'm the busy owners of a thriving real-estate investment company and I’m looking for someone who has the skill and motivation to help make our company that much better.

We’re looking for a LEAD INTAKE CALL SPECIALIST. A Lead Intake Call Specialist

Odds are this job is not right for you. But, if you happen to posses the skills and personality traits I'm looking for, this may very well be your dream job. Seriously.

You’ll have flexibility in your work (i.e. a lot of autonomy) while being part of an organization that has been making a massive, positive impact in the lives of homeowners all over the province!

If you genuinely love solving problems, being super-organized, and working in a fast growing and fast moving organization, then this job could be for you.

But before we go further, I have a WARNING: I’m not the easiest person to work with. In fact, I’m very challenging. I move fast and can be impatient at times, but I’m more than willing with, and train, the right person for the job.

Listen, neither you nor I have time to waste. There’s no room in our schedules for long conversations about irrelevant items, or room for error or miscommunication.

You need to operate at a high level and have impeccable written communication skills so that nothing falls through the cracks.

All that said, you must be the type of person that thrives in this fast paced environment, and give all of our leads the attention they deserve. In this role, you’ll be:

&gt; The first point of contact between the company and a new lead;

&gt; The liason person between that contact and our sales / admin teams;

&gt; Inputting info into our database;

&gt; Following up with leads on a regular basis;

&gt; Helping to organize marketing campaigns;

In short, the right person has to be willing to do virtually anything that needs to be done with regards to leads! You really are the face of the company in a lot of ways!

The right person for this position is:

- Excellent with people over the phone. I don’t want to sugar-coat it, so here goes: you’re going to deal with the odd frustrated person. This won’t happen that often, most people are polite and courteous, but when it does - they’re going to be upset at you…for no good reason. You need to be able to handle that.

- Incredibly proactive. They look for things that need to be done and they do them. They don't wait around until they are told to do something.

- Organized. You’re going to log, retrieve, edit, and otherwise control a LOT of data.

- Flexible. You need to be comfortable when plans change when things go wrong. I need someone with a cool head and a can-do attitude.

- Positive. You have to be positive. I don't want to hear about your problems. I don't want to hear complaints. I want to hear what you're doing to make each day a kick ass day.

- An excellent communicator: both written and verbal.

- A FAST learner. I'll expose you to many, many new opportunities. If you can't pick up new concepts fast, you'll be lost and I'll be frustrated.

- Has discretion and can maintain confidentiality. I’m a private person; I demand complete discretion and confidentiality. Because of this, the more I trust you, the more rewarding the job will be for you.

Compensation is fully negotiable. I'm willing to pay for the right person. I wouldn't expect to find anyone for less than $45,000 per year. So, that's the starting point but I'm willing to pay more if you happen to be amazing. If you are the right person and add tremendous value to my life, you'll come to realize that I'm an extremely generous man.

$45,000 starting + GENEROUS QUARTERLY BONUSES = THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE YOUR SALARY IN THE FIRST 2 YEARS!!

So, if you think you might be the right person for this job, send me your resume and, more importantly, a cover letter. If you have the gumption to send a video as well, or instead of a cover letter, great!

I don't want some generic cover letter… If you do, I'll throw it away without a second thought. Instead, tell me why, in detail, YOU are the right person for this position along with your salary expectations.

Please email your cover letter and resume.",False,n3tau8,SamHasThePlan,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n3tau8/interesting_job_description/,0,1

One of my dogs has several barks: a play bark and a
squirrel bark and other dog things that are normal dog
barks. He also had what we call his “emergency bark”.
The emergency bark is what he does when he thinks
there is serious danger. It is EXTREMELY loud and
makes us jump every time. He usually reserves it for
things like the time | fell down the stairs and he scream
barked for my husband to help, or when someone is in
our front yard, or when he cornered a dorsum in the
backward.

However, since my husband started working from home
this dog barks his emergency bark at my husband if he
tries working past pm. By husband now has learned
to stop working at about 3:50 every day to avoid that

In the 3 work days since then, I’ve been happier than I have been in years.","So I had a bit of a mental breakdown about my career a month or so ago. It started feeling nearly impossible to go every day, and I was feeling the stress physically in the form of anxiety-vomiting and severe migraines. 

Well, I was let go Friday (I’d quit already but they let me leave without working the rest of my notice). My wife and I agreed we can survive financially if I take two or three months off and work through some stuff in therapy. 

Y’all, it has only been 3 business days and I feel healthier than I have in years. I’ve done so much cleaning around the house, finished up some projects that had been sitting, have been painting and writing every day, practicing languages, sleeping well and napping whenever I feel the need, eating great home-cooked meals, going on long meandering walks with my dog (who is also thrilled I’m home). I even sent in an application to volunteer at the local women’s shelter, either as an on-call person to accompany women to hospitals/court or as a childcare volunteer while moms are busy working/in support groups. 

I’m only giving my attention to what makes my heart sing and I’m so happy I could cry. I know this can’t reasonably be forever (unless by some miracle I get suddenly Great Enough At Painting or Writing to Get Paid For It), but damn is it exactly what I needed for now.

Your grandfather didn't need to spam his resume to 100 jobs just to get a single interview. He just walked across the road, maybe across another street and boom he found another job. 

What happened? Employers needed workers much more so than today. Before technology it was harder to automate jobs away. Before globalization you couldn't send jobs to Asia. Before Harvard MBAs and a corporate obsession with manufacturing metrics like efficiency and lean sigma; four workers weren't laid off with one worker having to do his/her work plus the four employees who were laid off (just to cut costs).

But with such limited jobs and so many employees; the real problem is we don't need everyone in the workforce. Our capitalistic system assumes everyone who is able bodied can find a full time job and can pay for their expenses. Those that can't are considered lazy, defective or failures.

3925,Second day of my first ever job and I can feel the want to die growing stronger every time I think about work,"I work at a hotel as a houseman (basically janitor) and this shit is too physically demanding for my weak ass. My parents are forcing me to work there I have no say in my life.

So first day they had me fill out paperwork and vacuum the hallways on five floors (paperwork was the only thing I didn't mind during these two whole days)

I rushed the vacuuming a bit after a while because I got bored but I wish I hadn't. I then had to mop up around the pool with screaming children in it and it was torture.

Second day (today...) I was smart and vacuumed as slow as possible. Vacuum broke so spent like 20 minutes finding a new one and I thought I was gonna have a good day.

But the guy training me had me stop before I could vacuum the last floor and he made me go through all the empty rooms and pick up trash. I felt rushed because I'm a slow person (probably due to my autism) and this dude is like motherfucking speed racer going in and out of each room in under a minute while it takes me two minutes due to motor skill issues and trouble processing literally everything.

I had to push this giant trash bin which was extremely difficult (I'm literally the weakest person in my town) and I fucked up by putting it back in the wrong spot and he got mad at me and I started thinking about how useless I was for the rest of the day.

Also when I was taking the trash out I was surrounded by hornets :/

I cannot stay here for long. Next weekend even before I go in I already know I'll actually become suicidal. I just wanna bawl my eyes out.

I am going to get into the bad habit of spending my paycheck on weed and use it to cope. Maybe one day I'll stop giving a fuck and keep a dab pen in my shoe and hit it in the bathroom on break... Literally the only thing that will keep me sane. We are forced to lock up all personal belongings including phones so I can't listen to music or anything.

I can't understand **HOW THE FUCK ANYONE CAN DO THIS SHIT.** Some people do this every fucking day too... How do people not kill themselves??? I'm forced to bust my ass the entire shift with a 30 minute lunch break and another 10 minute break. Still not enough time for me to recover.

3926,Let’s discuss LinkedIn,"Sorry for the rant in advance...

There exists a degree of insincerity in any social media platform. Each serves as a means to showcase different aspects of yourself. Facebook is what you may reveal to your family, Instagram is what you may reveal to your friends, and LinkedIn is what you may reveal to potential employers. I find LinkedIn as a platform particular unsettling because it acts as the link between you and your means for survival. Unless you are a fully devoted anarcho primitivist, employment serves as your only means for survival. Pre modern conditions fostered the instincts that make it so there are no lengths to which we will not go to access the means of survival. So although the system has changed from risking your life for the hunt into dressing up your LinkedIn page, the instinct persists. The result is a culture obsessed with subservience to a provider. We are biologically wired to continually pursue our means for survival. And when that became synonymous with employment, we created a culture where professionalism is paramount, language is sanitized, and real human expression is squandered. To me, this is most easily observed on LinkedIn. Not an ounce of my humanity is represented on my LinkedIn page. It’s purpose is to seduce an employer into providing me with the means to life. I put serious effort into this page because it is my only way of satisfying my instinct to survive. It’s an artificial knockoff of myself, contorted into a soulless servant thats fits perfectly into the desires of some corporate hack.

3927,I'm in desperate need of help..,"Hey guys,

being in an (for me) incredibly hard spot right now I'm desperately seeking for help at any matter.

Sorry for my bad english in advance, I'm not a natural speaker and I have a massive headache from crying.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start with my story, when I was 20 after my a levels in germany I decided to start to study to become a teacher, while that approach failed miserably due to my lack of self motivation etc., I then faced a big problem:

&amp;#x200B;

What to do with my life?

&amp;#x200B;

After a long pause and part-time working at a local cinema I still didn't have any clue of what to do. I found a promising traineeship that I wanted to start.

I started at a Location near my hometown and soon was willing to become an eventmanager there.

After I invested 2 years of training they decided to keep me, because my boss became a parent and they needed a replacement for a year.

Since I've found a girlfriend there and a few nice friends, even a new bestie, this was the first time ever I was willing to put in ALL the effort I had in order to be able to stay there permanently.

But guess what? 

After the year they fired me and left me heartbroken. Eventhough I offered them my SOUL and everything I got for a bullshit salary - JUST TO BE ABLE TO STAY.

This was seriously a company and an office in general where I WANTED to stay for the rest of my life. Every day I got home lucky and even more lucky when I saw the face of my beautiful girlfriend, which has moved together with me last december.

Since then everything fell apart.

I started working for a Lasertag startup, that was rigged in every way. I started as a Vize Manager and were forced to observe the co-workers and torture them with weird and uneccesary work, it killed me, so I quit due to a new Job offer that I got from a friend:

I started a Job at a local symphony orchestra, which in the beginning was actually not that great, but not bad either. It then got better after a period of time. I got a decent friend there as well and there was no boss blaming me for everything because no one had a clue of what I was actually doing. They just let me do what I wanted to do and gave me my monthly salary.

I was about 70% happy, because I managed to get a friend of mine into the company as well - making my daily routine miles better.

&amp;#x200B;

But still I was seeking for the last 30% of happiness that I had in the event location mentioned earlier.

So I quit there after a year and a half in order to find something better and more challenging. I had the feeling that somewhere out there had to be a thing that'd make me happy.

I started at a car-company which turned out to be the fucking HELL. They were selling cars and they fished me telling me that I would be one of the managers soon. It was a big ass company and my brother worked there. He told me, that all of it was fine and in the end it was [HELL.ON.EARTH](https://HELL.ON.EARTH).

I needed to quit after 2 weeks in because I was mobbed and absolutely not accepted by any of my co workers who - how it turned out - only tried to survive there as well.

In the meantime corona appeared and gave me a hard time to find something new, eventhough I have been incredibly lucky and found a new job at a marketing agency, where my first day was just today.

&amp;#x200B;

And how was it?

  
Well guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to cry on my car drive back. Driving home being the disgrace of the day to my girlfriend (which to the current moment is the only reason I still want to be alive) killed me.

It's hard for her as well, it destroys her inside that I just seemingly can't be happy about anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys suggest me? I'm turning 27 this year and I feel like everyone else is just so much more strict when it comes to working attitude and stuff like that. Everyone seems to even like overtime. And I hate myself for even entering a new challenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue what I should do. Whenever I searched for a new job it turned out to be worse - or at least it turned out not to be better at all. It feels like I'm stagnating already and I'm a fucking young adult without any obvious interests. Had a lot of brainstormings with my parents and girl what I should do and where my interests are. But for me it seems there is just nothing that can fit.

&amp;#x200B;

All the best and thank you for reading!

3932,"""Oh I work here"" as if that doesn't still merit a thank you / a rant","I was just killing 2 birds with 1 stone and walking my dog while hitting up the nearest convenience store.

I brought my own bags to check out, and as I had my items and carrying my pup, they're going thru shift change so we customers are asked to wait.

I was going to wait outside because the 1 girl said it'd be 15 minutes and I figured with my dog it'd be easier to meander out there until we could buy our things.

Luckily, I am guessing the manager, took the only other guy in store + myself and rang us up. I said I wouldn't need a bag as I have my own, and he begins helping me pack the milk and items purchased since my hands are full with my puppy.

I tell him thank you at least twice, and he says with such ease ""Oh I work here""....as if simply because he is a worker his efforts to help me don't still warrant thanks.

I told him he still deserves gratitude and thanked him again...but that's sticking with me.

Fuck this whole system. Workers don't even treat themselves like people anymore.

If you are helping me or providing me with something - even if it is your job - I will express my thanks. I don't understand why others choose to die on this hill and insist people doing their jobs don't require the same basics any human deserves.

From the luck of my parents, I was able to get a degree and get a nice white collar software development job. Somewhat priveledged, and I recognise that, but its still a grind. A grind with a good salary.  


I've been doing this for 10 years. And I'm really hanging on by the skin of my teeth, as they used to say. Every week I barely get anything done. Each month I earn a really good salary, but damn I'm not sure if I deserve it.  


Any month now, my team lead may very well say ""hey, what on earth have you been doing for the past 2 weeks??""

3950,"You know what I really want in life? It's to have a deep interest in something lucrative, to slowly master it over the years. But for quite a while now, I've been knee-deep in my search to find any such interest, with no success. Has anyone else been in such a situation?"," 

This actually pains me quite a bit.

I know I should technically just suck it up and stop complaining so much and asking for the world.

But my stupid brain works in such a way that I really need to be interested in something if I am to have any success at all with it. If I am to spent 8+ hours a day working on something for the rest of my life, I really don't wait it to be something I merely tolerate.

Now one might ask how the hell can one not be interested in anything in this gigantic world of ours? And I really can't explain it myself. But after what's probably hundreds of hours of searching for any sort of interest that could be my profession/career/whatever, even perusing lists of jobs and businesses and such, I've found nothing. People would suggest that I do something related to my interests that I engage in my free time, but to be honest all I've really done in life was relaxing by vegetating in front of the TV, or playing games. Neither of which I'm particularly interested in anymore. Certainly not creating these things.

It would be heaven for me to find something that I was so interested in doing, that work didn't feel like work at all. That even after coming home from work, I'd choose to engage in that activity since it's truly my passion. Man, I'd give my left nut to have such an interest.

**And how it relates to antiwork, and I really want to know this: are there people out there who really enjoy their work? Like how I used rush home to just lie down in bed and vegetate in front of a sitcom or a videogame. Are there people who enjoy work that much that they really want to be there, to work on what they do?

I have a habit of rambling so I'll keep it short, and I'm sorry for any disorganization/confusion but I just want to share.

I'm so thankful for the honest discussions on this subreddit that are oriented around how work interacts with health, and healthcare. Its not just anti-work, its pro-worker, or pro-humanbeing (pro-proletariats if ya wanna get alliterative). How there's injustice occurring even when employees take reasonable steps towards their own health, which you'd think that management would accomodate and be supportive of because it boosts productivity (ugh) and ensures the safety of the people who work for them. I've read of people here who have gotten fired for seeking leaves for things such as being sick, attending to their mental/social-emotional wellbeing like if they have to attend a funeral, etc. 

Today I picked my mom up early from work, after she said she threw up this morning. She told the manager that she needed to leave. He was in a sour mood since so many other workers apparently called off today, too, so he said something to the effect of telling her to go see her doctor already, since she's been needing an operation for months now, but never had the chance to do it. And tbh this has been a historical thing with her- She always feels sick due to her medical issue that she really needs that operation for, but she's put it off because she's struggling with her bills. But today was the day her manager really did go off on her to just get help already. 

She asked me for advice. I offered the following-

Coordinate between the doctor (express interest in having the operation date set soon), the human resources department (inform them that she needs to leave temporary basis for medical health related reasons. Ask that she be able to leave the company, with the window to come back after) and see if its possible for her to get onto unemployment during the time in which she'll need the operation+ recovery time.

But first and foremost, write and record and document the interaction, time and date she had with her manager who told her the comment related to her health, that he had really cited her sick time/absences to her (which she had not gone over) and his comment that she would die from her gallstones (btw she's got gallbladder stones). And proceed to write record and document whatever interaction/responses she gets from HR, just in case. 

What do ya'll think of the idea/suggestion I offered her? Cos she likes her job tbh, but we can't with the way it blames her for her health problems and her needing to call out. I feel emboldened by reading this subreddit in offering this sort of advice to protect herself and seek help.",False,n39z8y,writenicely,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n39z8y/thank_you_for_the_healthcare_related_discussions/,0,1

I don't know about you all, but I definitely didn't spend my last year of high school thinking about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. And they say you should be figuring that out as as early as a freshman? God no. I was too busy trying to navigate that social and academic hellhole just so I could graduate on time. By the time I finished high school, I was burnt out then. Senior year had wrecked me so bad that I didn't want anything else to do with education beyond that point. Not any time soon at least. I wanted to recover, recollect myself, and relax. 



That summer, I caught up on some much needed rest, but with the Fall season looming, my family started to lay into me about how I needed to be doing something with myself (couldn't even get a damn gap year). This continued relentlessly for months until I started to look for colleges I could apply to just to appease them. I was good with computers, so I figured I would go to school and study in Computer Information Systems. You know, study in a STEM field so I could make a lot of money that I didn't care to make.



I did that shit for 3 1/2 years before I decided it just wasn't for me. I hated it, so I switched my major to Communications. I'm a good creative writer. So why not? Finished up my BS in Communications 2 1/2 years later and graduated with a degree that I've only recently realized that I also didn't truly want. Only at 26 years old, with no more energy, motivation, or money, have I started to figure out what I would've been happy to do with my life if I could go back in time. 



I've spread myself over so much dumb shit just because I didn't have an opportunity to actually discover myself at my own pace, and now I don't wanna do anything. I definitely don't wanna work a job that I know I'm gonna hate for the rest of my life.",False,n3cj70,JediKnightKeylo,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n3cj70/i_love_how_youre_expected_to_navigate_the_first/,7,1

So I reached out about the help available, and got signed up to positivity classes, meditation and yoga. I cancelled meditation because I already do that on my own. It doesn't help. If anything I become more aware of the futility of my job and therefore life.

The positivity class was about reframing everything as a positive. The yoga classes ended and everything was exactly the same as before.

I reached out again to feedback about high stress levels. My boss said, Well you're not thinking positively. Your mindset is wrong. 

That's when I realised. There's nothing wrong with my mental health for having anxiety. I'm just reacting with stress to a stressful situation (pushy people, tight deadlines, difficult work). I don't have anxiety at weekends so that's telling. But this mental health lark was an insidious way to push the blame and onus on me.

But now I started a random job in a factory last Monday. For a job with no skills required the pay is actually crazy high, around $22/hour including bonuses for shift work and Sundays. 

Still, I absolutely f***ing hate it. Constantly changing between early, late and night shifts is making me insanely exhausted and my body constantly itches and stings from the glass fibre they manufacture.

On top of that I have a fairly independent personality so constantly being told to go there, come here, do this, don’t do this, “x,y and z is prohibited here” is already starting to really piss me off.

I've managed to set my life up so that I do minimal work, am married with no kids, and already have or am on track to soon get most of the material possessions I desire (not much tbh).

But I'm suffering from some type of existential crisis now. Sure I had a tendency for existentialism before, but it's been increasing.

I simply can't seem to find worthwhile endeavors in my free time. I exercise and do little projects etc. But seem to be lacking a bigger goal in life. Now that I have all this time and comfort, what should I do?

It made me think that when we are in an undesirable position, we are very motivated to make moves. But once things are good, the need to make moves goes away, and maybe it is actually that need that gives us a weird type of goal-oriented pleasure or whatever.

4012,I was fired from a job that drove me insane in less than 6 months,"Story time: Last year I was laid off from a corporate job that was really boring but I actually enjoyed it because my co-workers and boss were supportive (COVID of course tanked the company and they had to let people go). I had never been laid off or fired before, but for some reason I wasn't eligible for unemployment so I was in a panic and took the first job offered to me. It was more blue collar than I was used to, but it was in my field and paid just about the same so I went with it.

Let me tell you this - If you think corporate culture is too sanitary and PC, you'll be begging for it when you're in a less structured situation run by a high-strung cokehead. That's exactly what happened with me. Sick of pointless meetings? Try working in a place where there's almost no clear communication from up high and you'll either be yelled at for doing what he said with limited information or taking the lead and trying to solve a problem on your own. Cringing at endless corporate training? How about not being trained at all, even though he knows you have no experience in this type of field, and then he flips out on you for not knowing anything and then refusing to train you. Every situation was damned if you do, damned if you don't.

The first month was actually pretty decent, but then something changed in my boss. I was eventually tasked with doing almost everything at the business on top of my regular work without being trained for any of it. Because of this inexperience and the fact that I was drowning in work I'd make mistakes. But I'd never hear from him if I did a good job, I'd only hear from him if I screwed up. And boy did I hear from him! In fact, the only way I knew a project was going smoothly is if he didn't say anything. Never heard a positive word about my work after that first month. His way of motivating me? Telling me I'm overpaid and costing him money because of my wages and the mistakes I was making due to lack of proper leadership.

At the 2 month mark I began having sleep issues. I've always been able to get a good 6-8 hours' sleep no matter how stressed I was. But this job put me on such edge that I would either fall asleep and then be woken up 2 hours later because of a work dream and not be able to fall back to sleep, or just not sleep at all the entire night even though I was absolutely exhausted. The latter happened at least twice a week. So I was a zombie, but the anxiety of the possibility of facing my boss's wrath made me on high alert and run on pure adrenaline - I actually drank less coffee than I had in years because I was naturally wired.

I had no energy to do anything, I couldn't exercise, and I was eating like shit. Work was so hectic that I hadn't had a lunch break in months, unless you count inhaling a protein bar at my desk while he stepped out for 2 seconds lunch. My commute was 90 minutes one way and I racked up an insane amount of miles on my new leased car (~2,000 a month). I'd get home and just be grumpy and mean to my girlfriend and everyone I encountered. My job was one where I had to physically be there in able to perform it, but still I couldn't stop thinking about work once I got home. My Christmas and New Year's were ruined because the days leading up to those holidays was like a pressure cooker, the highlight being when my boss called a 16-year-old kid who worked with us an idiot to his face.

One Monday morning I woke up after not having slept the night before, dreading coming back to work after the weekend. I was physically shaking. I went to go walk my dog with my girlfriend and I just broke down crying. Prior to this I had only cried a handful of times in the past decade, always relating to the death of a loved one. My girlfriend told me to take the day off. I texted my boss to tell him I wasn't coming in (First time I had ever take off work in 6 months) and he was none too pleased.

The next day I drove 90 minutes to work, only to find my desk was cleared. My boss walks out, stops me, and hands me my paycheck. He tells me that last week a project I was a part of had gotten screwed up, something which could've been easily avoided had there been a chain of communication or quality control. He said I was costing him too much and he had to let me go. I kept things civil, but I walked out and never looked back.

I've been unemployed for a few months now and I'm making just about as much on unemployment as I did while employed. My head was so fucked up from just 6 months at this job that I needed a good month to decompress and get a reality check. Yes, my perspective of myself was so skewed from this den of negativity that I thought I was useless or retarded and would never amount to anything again. I had to re-connect with some friends and family and even past co-workers to be assured that I wasn't a complete fuck-up.

I got some advice from a former co-worker when it came to job searching - ""Be picky"". Taking whatever job without doing the proper research lead me to this fiasco, so I decided to put myself out there as I am and see who comes, rather than me changing myself to please a potential employer. It's even better if I can get some referrals from people who work at places or know someone who does, as that will help me gauge what it's like there. 

This whole situation lead me to this subreddit. The job market was tough for millennials' quality of life since the 2000s, but Covid has just kicked the bullshit up a notch. You now have to give it 300% instead of 200% since everyone's jobs are in jeopardy. And chances are a bunch of people in your team were laid off, so you now have to take on their work without a raise (Or if your company made you take a pay cut, do it for even less money than usual). Every job I've found on my search pays less than what I was making before and they expect more work. I remember my parents working 8 hours and coming home and watching TV and relaxing. But something tells me it'll be the norm for my peers' free time to be spent either doing stuff for work, or going back to school, or having a side hustle to make ends meet. And even when you do have free time, your phone could always ring with a work-related call because our pocket computers make it expected that we can be reached at any time.

4019,Does anyone else feel dehumanized by work especially when they make a mistake?,"Today I got sent home because I missed a few calls on the radio by accident. I wasn't even supposed to be working today and had asked off three weeks prior so I could spend time with my husband (who was able to fly in from his country this week) and move into my new apartment.

According to HR I wasn't also supposed to be working today because of conflict I had with a coworker a few months back. A few months ago they changed my schedule so I could avoid this coworker. Guess it didn't count today because it's a ""black out date"" where no one can call off unless they have no pulse basically. I told my managers to please let me off early so I didn't have to see that coworker. Again they refused to even let me off early and told me I had to come in. 

So I'm forced to come to work. My partner comes in during my shift to bring me food and calm my anxiety since I was forced to work with the coworker that gave me anxiety. I'm also extremely anxious because I still have to move my things and today was supposed to be my move in date. I was still doing my job perfectly fine as per usual. And I so happen to accidentally have the radio on low near the end of my shift. A coworker approaches me and tells me the manager has called me 6 times. I was confused because I hadn't heard anything on the radio.

I find manager who said quote ""you have not been productive all day and been walking around with that man every time I saw you so I'm asking you to leave"". 

I was stunned and angry because it's not fair that my coworkers can walk around with each other and talk but I can't walk around with my partner who visited me near the end of my shift I wasnt supposed to work anyways. 

I talked to my other manager who I actually really liked and she said she had to send me home early due to me missing the radio calls because of the handbook rules. 

This happened in front of all of my coworkers. 

I feel absolutely humiliated. And the way my other manager talked to me about how I wasn't productive was absolutely bullshit. 

I can't stop crying over the humiliation. I shouldn't have been working today. I'm not supposed to be working period due to my severe mental health issues.

We always seem to be following people these days, we never come up with anything on our own, I kinda get it, we're comfortable in our ticky tacky little boxes not having to make any decisions, any important ones atleast, atleast we get to decide between coke and pepsi I guess, except every time I choose coke they bring me some flouridated liquid that burns the fuck out of my nose, but then again maybe that's a good thing, better to have a lowered IQ than it is to be *depopulated* with the fentynal spiced cocaine that has taken out a few of my good friends and countless other so called useless eaters... 

This is is how we've come to this point though, we are no longer makers and doers in society we are followers, useless eaters *they* say. We don't choose how this world is ran whatsoever, some think they do, when their puppet is selected atleast, but if their puppet isn't selected they are more than happy to admit that the system is rigged, funny how that works eh? 

Therein lies the problem though, our trust in these fictional television characters to save us from what we are told is ourselves, but really we need saving from *them*, kinda... 

*they*(deserving no capitalization) certaintly do manufacture all of our problems such as war and poverty, but we are collectively just as much at fault for allowing it, and this is where a positive change starts, by not allowing it, it gets tricky here though, as we do not have the means to go to war with *them*, I mean sure, we could assasinate one of their puppets, but they already have another one cloned to take *its* place, and no matter how sneaky you are, you'll never get close to the castle's wall, so what in God's name are we to do? 

Tricky as it may be, it's rather simple, just stop inserting coins into *their* machine, quit playing *their* game... 

Simple, but I understand extremely hard for most. We have to give up our false sense of security, and we'll have to give up our modern comforts, but only for awhile.... 

I believe the answer is forming our own communities, within *theirs*, our New World Order inside of *their* not so new world order. 

Basically we need to come together, those like us may seem spread out, but I gaurentee you are not the only one that despises this system in your city or town, I think a lot of people are just waiting for something better, once it's built they will flock. 

So the *evolution*(not revolution because history has shown us they always end where they started), starts with little hippy like communes built all over the world, communities where we grow, fish and hunt our own food, make our own clothes, make our own music, and most importantly raise proper human beings that both understand and care about this world, we need to raise a true leader, so that when we finally do hit critical mass, we can take over everything and start really fixing this world. 

None of this will require giving up our families or even our jobs, we do this all in our own locals, the only difference is we are working and living together, ofcourse if you're like me you'll happily give up your job though to spend the days contributing to something worth while... 

I'm not talking about living in shacks either, there is lot's of land out there, we can build whatever we want, we can light it up with solar, water wheels and whatever else there is, so long as it doesn't resemble a garbage dump, we need to be one with nature. 

Don't forget, we, the decent human beings, have more of a right to this land than monarchs and corporations such as nestle... 

This is our world, let's take it back and show it some fucking love my friends, peace and love to you all.",False,n3gc89,WeAreInTheBadPlace,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n3gc89/our_new_world_order/,4,1

4077,"For your hard work, we've decided to reward you... With a coupon.","A few years back, I worked as a night stocker for krogers in the frozen section. It was pretty rough job. Working through the night, manual labor, and having a full day of college classes about an hour or two after I got off. I hated the job. 

Well, one night my only other co-worker cut his hand pretty badly on the AC fan of one of the isle freezers when he was trying to repair it. The store told him to do it. He needed stitches and had to take off two weeks to heal. Which meant I now had to do a three man job, that was being done by two men, alone for the next two weeks.

While I did have some help, if the store had people they could spare, they were more or less useless. The first guy they sent my way ran off to other areas within the first hour or two of the shift each night. The second guy had done the job before me but refused to work on anything but the ice cream isle and took all night, even with my help after finishing the other isles. And this isn't even mentioning all the extra nights I had to come in to unload the stock that inevitably backed up.

But two weeks pass and my co-worker comes back. All ship shape. Back on schedule.

About a month later I got called to the managers office. I was surprised to find the store manager and my co-worker there congratulating me on a job well done. They said I was amazing, a hard worker, and deserved a reward. Do you know what that reward was? 

A coupon for $1 off any item in the store. Not a $1 raise. Not a $1. A God damn coupon for $1 ( provided the item was more than $1). They said I earned it.

I honestly thought it was a joke when they gave it to me.

4080,Should I quit?,"So I was hired as a part time medical scribe/transcriptionist in a medical office around January (I’m also in nursing school). I was offered $16/hr which is only 50 cents above the minimum wage (I live in a very high cost of living area). 

A few weeks later, the manager started asking me to do receptionist work once in a while. Now, it has gotten to the point where I come in and I don’t know what job I’m going to be doing for the day.  On top of all this, my manager (who is the mother of the doctor and is ~84 yrs old)  now wants me to be trained to do the medical assistant’s work. I still haven’t gotten a raise when initially I was hired to be a scribe. I was blatantly lied to about my position. 

Since January, I’ve seen 4 or 5 people leave. The office is constantly hiring except now the manager doesn’t want to hire anyone new because she decided she’d rather double or triple train the people she already has. 

On top of all of this, I have to work with highly incompetent people and another receptionist who I think contributes to a hostile work environment (always cursing under her breath, slamming the desk, being aggressive which makes me uncomfortable). The manager also has favorites and is blatantly sexist (the other male scribe doesn’t do any other work bc she says females are better receptionists).

Just yesterday, I was working with another receptionist (who is a full time receptionist). At the end of the day, I asked her if she turned off the phones. She said yes but the phone rang twice afterward so I asked her about that and she told me that some phone calls are still able to go through. She always turns off the phones at the end of our shift so I didn’t think much of it. It was already 15 minutes after my shift ended at this point and so I left because we don’t have a clock in/out system (the hours are just tallied up by the manager beforehand and I wasn’t being paid for this extra time). 

So after her and I leave, I get a phone call from the doctor asking who turned the phones off. I say it was her. He starts going off about how he could lose his license and that you have to turn off the phones using a special phone. I obviously didn’t know this as my co-worker always turns off the phone. He starts throwing a fit and giving me attitude when I did the majority of the work that shift while my co-worker barely did shit (she just immigrated to the US a few yrs ago and barely knows English).

if i am afraid (my default), i will be poor, sicker, and waste away into nothingness.

if i have to return to the office, i might quit. 
but, even if i happen to get permanent remote work, this job might still be the death of me. 

we have to redo our performance goals for the year in a dumb new HR system and it’s really hard to not say that my goal is to not die in this job... but, that’s really my goal. 

how can i get laid off?

4126,The story of a quitter,"I was heavily depressed, yet my parents were so obsessed with the idea of me getting a degree that they didn't want me to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

I quit college. I found a job. People higher in the hierarchy shouted all the time. Colleagues were all into jealousy, backstabbing and ridiculing eachother.

I quit.

I found a job with a great job description. It seemed kinda like a technical position. Tons of problem solving, you know. Great, I send my CV. I get the job. I get into the ""office"". It's a call center. The place was so filled with people that they seemed like a jar of sardines. Being an inbound call center, I had to constantly answer phone calls, and since I'm heavily introverted I was going insane.

I quit.

Then I tried a degree as a medical technician, knowing the interaction with people were supposed to be minimal and impersonal. Doctors tried to exploit the shit out of the students and were super disrespectful. Insulting and shouting was the norm. And the other students thought it was ok. Doctors instulted and shouted at them and they just continued kissing their asses. They also were jealous backstabbers who ridiculed every mistake and reported everything to the bosses.

I quit.

Then I tried working at an optician, since it was the only job I could find. I have to say the job was a little bit less stressful, but such a socially oriented job causes great stress to me in the long term. And my supervisor was the most bitter girl I've ever known. She would explain things one time very fast, and if I messed up she would get totally mad and shout, but she would also shout if I asked for further explanations. One day when I was having lunch and she didn't know I was already there I heard her telling another colleague that I forgot everything she explained, just because that day I made a mistake.

I quit.

At that point I was absolutely burned out, but pressure from my parents led me to get back to the first degree I tried, since I did all the exams of the first years and they were still valid for the university despite having quit. Being burned out, I gave no exams. I got into therapy. I quit therapy. I did some exams.

I quit therapy because according to me the therapist was just eager to find disorders in my head in order to give me lithium. I'm no way bipolar. For sure I changed lifestyle very often, but it was just in an attempt to find a way to become ""normal"" and just work. But I can't fucking fit in. I feel like on the job market everyone's a sociopath and the environment is so cruel.

Two years have passed since the burnout. I'm 25 years old. If a miracle happens and do everything perfectly I'll get a bachelor degree when I'm 26, but most likely I'll get the degree at 27. It's even more likely I'll never get the degree.

Right now I kinda got to the point in which I don't want to attempt to go back to the job market. Hierarchy drives people insane, and I don't want to get into hell again. My mind wanders from place to place. Sometimes I'm satisfied not giving a fuck about corporate life, enjoying a walk in nature or a cup of tea. Sometimes I feel like I messed up, am a failure and realize I'm in a shameful position for all the people, and I feel the eyes on me and want to die.

I don't give a fuck about richness, fame, girls, I just want to have a small house in a tiny village were I can have walks in nature on my own.",False,n2f3cg,Solitano,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/n2f3cg/the_story_of_a_quitter/,11,1
